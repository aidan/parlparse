Rooker:</b> My Lords, the chief executive has said
nothing different from what I have said in the House on more than one
occasion. We are speaking from the same evidence. That is why we draw
the same conclusion, which is to warn people that the 2006 scheme
started before May this year when the forms were sent out. The 2007
forms will be signed off within a month or a few weeks&#146; time. It
will be 2008 before substantial changes can be made to the system. In
any event, making substantial changes to the system year on year is a
recipe for disaster.</p><p><a name="06102316000068"></a>I warn farmers and
everybody else that the payments year we are
entering&#151;the window starts 1 December this
year&#151;will be as difficult as the previous year, not least
because the first year has an effect on the second year. This
year&#146;s difficulties relating to mapping and other issues
relating to the 2 million-odd fields in this country on which
payments will be made will have a legacy for next year. That is why we
are not making any promises about when we will be able to start. We
hope to deliver a better system, but hope is not the basis on which I
intend to respond to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102316000069"></a><b><a name="61023-0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="06102316000694"></a>The

settled by the permanent secretary and the management of the Civil
Service. As regards the inquiry, I believe that the Public Accounts
Committee will take evidence next Monday from the permanent secretary
of the department and the current chief executive on the report that
was published last week. Therefore, there is nothing more that I can
say about the named individual. Other individuals, including former
Ministers and officials, are giving evidence about what has

no evidence of bankruptcy. Likewise, I have no evidence of suicides, as

suffered illness or distress as a result of this situation. People who
were specifically promised that they would receive money on certain
dates but have not received that money have suffered terrible turmoil.
There is no question that people took on debt. Their suppliers had to
be paid, or not as the case may be. There has been massive
turmoil.</p><p><a name="06102316000075"></a>We have allocated more
money to tackle rural stress as farmers asked for help. I am not
knocking that in any way. It has been a terrible year. As I say, we
apologise for that, and we hope that it will not happen again. Rural
Payments Agency staff are working their socks off to ensure that it
does not. However, in my present position, I cannot make any
promises.</p><p><a name="06102316000076"></a><b><a name="61023-0001.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="06102316000700"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, the Minister has
inherited a difficult situation that is not of his making. None the
less, the noble Baroness mentioned the additional interest paid by
farmers. Some 11 per cent of farmers have had to extend existing
loans, 8 per cent of those through not being paid or
operating at a loss. The NAO report says that it was a &#147;high
risk project&#148;. Matters were underestimated, and the progress
reporting was wholly inadequate. Would it not be better temporarily to
adopt the payments system operating in Scotland and Wales, which is
based on static historic payments, if farmers are not going to be
secure in their payments for the next two
years?</p><p><a name="06102316000077"></a><b><a name="61023-0001.htm_spnew30"></a><a name="06102316000701"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, we cannot do that. The 2006
scheme is already under way. The forms have been sent out. The European
Commission has approved the system that we are using. It will also be
used in 2007. The noble Lord&#146;s question and the theme that lies
behind it&#151;whether we should tear it up and go back to the old
historic payments system&#151; is one that I can assure him has been
asked in the
department.</p><p><a name="06102316000078"></a>Nevertheless, we are
looking to make the best of this system, which has the potential to be
much better than the systems used in the devolved Administrations.
However, for various reasons, as highlighted in the National Audit
Office report last week, every factor on the risk issues is read, as
everyone can see on page 43, with policy changes made late. Eleven
schemes into one is good, but under the 11 schemes the money was paid
earlier than under the one scheme. However, the potential is a lot
greater. I cannot give an assurance on interest payments at the moment,
simply because we owe 5,319 farmers top-up payments, and until they are
paid we cannot work out the delay in the payments to pay the interest
to them.</p>

Plumb:</b> My Lords, I am sure that the Minister has
done everything possible to bring some order out of chaos, but does he
realise that the 10 schemes listed in the National Audit Office report
could be multiplied by more than 1,000 for people who have suffered
stress and loss of revenue? Loss of revenue is one thing, but the loss
of trust and confidence, both in the Government and in the department,
is considerable. Why cannot the English scheme be delivered in the
declared time scale when the Germans, who applied exactly the same
scheme, paid on the nail within a matter of weeks from the beginning of
their scheme? Is the answer therefore to consider an early partial
payment for this year to try to restore some confidence in the
Government?</p><p><a name="06102316000080"></a><b><a name="61023-0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="06102316000703"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I do not have the details for
Germany with me, but as I understand it Germany did have problems. A
team from the Rural Payments Agency went to Germany in the summer to
discuss some of the common difficulties that we had had.
Notwithstanding that, I understand that France and the Republic of
Ireland are making advance payments.</p><p><a name="06102316000081"></a>The point that the noble Lord, Lord
Plumb, asked about is under consideration. No decisions have been made.
We asked the Rural Payments Agency in July to assess the position on
the scenarios for the payment prospects for 2006 and whether there
could be partial payments. Partial payments could be illegal under
Common Market rules, or they could be legal, depending on the dates
when they are paid and the knowledge that they are paid. These matters
are being actively considered, and it will not be too long before
Ministers can give directions to the RPA on which route to go down.
Obviously, we want to get money to farmers faster and to give them
certainty, but we cannot afford to have anything remotely like what
happened this year, when dates were given and not delivered. Given the
lack of trust, what farmers want is certainty. They may have to wait to
get certainty, so that we do not take the risk of again having the
catastrophic lack of trust that we had this year, which would be
compounded if there was a problem two years
running.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06102316000005"></a>NHS:

chaplaincy. From the evidence that I have been given, the trust has
good reasons for its decisions. One must bear in mind that the loss of
three chaplaincy posts would be the equivalent of losing about four
nurses.</p><p><a name="06102316000086"></a><b><a name="61023-0001.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="06102316000708"></a>Lord

to give me such evidence I will certainly look at it. I have seen no
evidence that there is some conspiracy to do down the chaplaincy
throughout the NHS. The Worcestershire trust is trying to deal with
some outstanding financial deficits, which it has to do. All of us want
the NHS to balance its books properly; the trust is taking the
appropriate action, and Ministers owe it to the trust to support those

Answer. I shall refer specifically to Guantanamo Bay. The UK wishes to
see this prison camp closed and, indeed, has described it as an
abomination. The US wants to return nine of those still held, two of
whom have refugee status in the UK and whose rights should therefore be
indistinguishable from those of a UK citizen. One has long-term
residency and the others various lengths of residency in the UK. None
of the nine has another state to which to apply for any form of
protection and none of them has been charged with an indictable
offence, but the UK is apparently unwilling to accept them because of
the stringent control orders imposed by the USA. I simply wish to
clarify to whom, if anyone, these people can apply for justice,
following well documented and severe ill treatment while being held at
Guantanamo
Bay.</p><p><a name="06102316000097"></a><b><a name="61023-0002.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="06102316000719"></a>Lord

abroad and should difficulties arise&#151;they are told this before
they leave the United Kingdom&#151;they can apply, as all refugees
can, to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights through
the local offices, which provide a full range of excellent services. We
most certainly do not expect them to have to return to or to apply for
assistance from the country from which they were refugees in the first
place. The Home Secretary is the person who will take a decision about
whether they can be returned to the United Kingdom in the event that
they are released. In the judicial review, both the High Court and the
Court of Appeal found that the only proper stance that he could take in
these circumstances, until such time as their release became imminent,
was the one that I have just
described.</p><p><a name="06102316000098"></a><b><a name="61023-0002.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="06102316000720"></a>Lord

British Government to long-term residents who have refugee status? We
are all concerned, particularly in the Guantanamo case, about the
number of people who are effectively being made stateless because they
have lost or are in danger of losing their resident status here and
have nowhere else to go to. What legal obligations under international

recognise?</p><p><a name="06102316000099"></a><b><a name="61023-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="06102316000721"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, in these cases, there are no
obligations under international or domestic law. That was precisely the
point that was put to the High Court and to the Court of Appeal in
October, and the matter was resolved unequivocally in those courts. Of
course there were discussions between the families of those individuals
and my noble friend Lady Symons, who was at the time responsible for
these matters. She passed on the views of those families to the United
States. So we were not unhelpful to them, but we have no obligation to
go further in law, and that has been the position for a very long
time.</p>

people in an effort to persuade Governments to behave in an appropriate

to express views about that to the House. The whole issue of diplomatic
protection has perhaps been somewhat misunderstood. It means the
invocation by one state through diplomatic action or other peaceful
means of settlement, on the basis of state-to-state judicial
proceedings, of the responsibility of the other state for a wrongful
act to the citizens of the first state. In other words, legally you can
act in that context only for a citizen of your own

set on completing this very important legislation, which has been a
long time in process. It is always a good challenge to come back to a
Bill after switching off over the long Recess, and I am sure that we
are all now approaching it with fresher minds and more
concentration.</p><p><a name="06102316000109"></a>As I did in full
at Second Reading, I declare my interest, particularly as a hill
livestock farmer in Scotland. In that regard, this legislation does not
apply to me, so I hope that your Lordships will allow me to voice my
concerns.</p><p><a name="06102316000110"></a>At first sight, the
precise wording of my amendment may appear a bit too specific to appear
in what is generally an enabling Bill, but the Government have allowed
certain specific areas of concern to be mentioned, so I feel that there
is justification.</p><p><a name="06102316000111"></a>In the Bill,
we are replacing legislation going back to the Protection of Animals
Act 1911, including Part I of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1968. The comforting thought is that we are to extend
to all animals the same protection that currently ensures the welfare
of livestock situated on agricultural
land.</p><p><a name="06102316000112"></a>At Second Reading, I
raised the concern that, as well as having a greater understanding of
what constitutes the welfare of animals, we now apply different
standards of judgment from those required 90 years ago. There is a real
question whether truly extensive hill farming can meet the sort of
standard that can be easily identified by the public in livestock
husbandry carried out on low
ground.</p><p><a name="06102316000113"></a>Perhaps I should say
that, if the Minister finds difficulties with my amendment, it might be

7, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer,
which I would support. The context in which this might arise would be
in regard to the Government's attitude to the degree of domestication
of hill sheep and even, in some cases, cattle. We will debate later
what constitutes a &#147;degree of
domestication&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102316000114"></a>These
animals are bred for their hardiness and their ability to withstand
harsh conditions. As part of the process of natural selection, which
has established these breeds, a certain number do not survive annually.
Good management means that many steps are taken to protect them from
infection and disease, and it is not uncommon for farmers and shepherds
to struggle out with bales of hay when sheep get cut off 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_996"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 996</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by snow drifts, but not much can be done when the problem is sheep
getting washed away in swollen rivers and
streams.</p><p><a name="06102316000115"></a>As
noble Lords may know, part of the management employed is to allow the
animals to gain condition through the summer and autumn in order to be
able to use that energy source and emerge in a lean condition in the
spring. One reason that shepherds will go through their flocks to cull
those that are found to have what are termed &#147;broken
mouths&#148; is that those sheep will have difficulty in pulling
through, but others will succumb for other
reasons.</p><p><a name="06102316000116"></a>Again, because of the
terrain and its extent, a shepherd may be able to get around only a
quarter of his ground in a day, so there will be days when many
individual sheep will not be supervised. Given the current state of the
industry, that problem is only likely to get
worse.</p><p><a name="06102316000117"></a>Other issues arise given
the fact that, when sheep are gathered for handlings&#151;a process
that can take two or three days&#151;there is no guarantee that all
the sheep will have been found, and so things such as one-day duration
treatments for sheep scab are likely to be counterproductive.</p><p><a name="06102316000118"></a>There is also the problem of what action
to take if it has not proved possible to castrate all the male lambs
before they are seven days old, as required by the current code of
welfare. A small handful of uncastrated lambs loose on a mountain can
cause havoc with the breeding programme. It is a question of whether my
concern should be directed, as I have done, at Clause 4, which deals
with cases where,</p><ul><a name="06102316000639"></a>&#147;an
act of his, or a failure ... to act, causes an animal to
suffer&#148;,</ul><p><a name="06102316000119"></a>or at Clause
9, headed:</p><ul><a name="06102316000513"></a>&#147;Duty of
person responsible for animal to ensure
welfare&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000494"></a>Either way,
one must question the ability of the Government to make such allowances
only later in regulations must come into
question.<p><a name="06102316000120"></a>This concern
encompasses the question of the livelihood of current hill farmers, but
there is also an ecological question of whether the type of upland
landscape that we desire can be maintained without the grazing provided
by sheep and cattle managed on an extensive basis. I know of nature
reserves where yearly mowing has had to be introduced to produce a
habitat for ground-nesting birds, and there are many areas of mountain
where an animal is the only realistic form of mowing that can be
contemplated.</p><p><a name="06102316000121"></a>My contention
today is that we will not have produced a truly comprehensive regime
for animal welfare unless we address these issues. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06102316000654"></a>3.15

interesting questions in his amendment. Indeed, he goes to the heart of
my amendment, on the degree of domestication, which I shall speak to
later. He referred to hill sheep&#151;perhaps a hefted flock, which
pretty much looks after itself day to day. I could speak, for example,
about the difference between the wild ponies of Exmoor, which are very
different from thoroughbreds, which need a rug in chilly wind or
weather. The noble Duke is right to mention the problem of
undergrazing, whether on mountain, moorland or&#151;where I spent
some of the Recess&#151;in the Culm grassland of Devon. That area is
experiencing undergrazing not overgrazing, with all the knock-on
effects on species that&#151;people may not even
appreciate&#151;depend on grazing. For example, we are used to
hearing curlews on estuaries, but they rely on a suitable site to nest.
A site that has become semi-scrub and brambly rather than rough
grassland will not be
suitable.</p><p><a name="06102316000124"></a>The question of how
animals are treated and how the public will react to those animals to
which the noble Duke referred is critical. I very much look forward to
hearing the Minister&#146;s reply on these
issues.</p><p><a name="06102316000125"></a><b><a name="61023-0002.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="06102316000727"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Duke
for the way in which he introduced his amendment. I believe that I can
reassure him because essentially he is asking for a commitment that
what he described as being in some ways traditional farming practices
in areas of mountain and moorland will not be made illegal under this
Bill. Broadly speaking, I can say that they will not.</p><p><a name="06102316000126"></a>The special regulations
relate not exclusively but mainly to sheep. The noble Duke is concerned
that sheep management practices that take place now should be allowed
to continue. We understand that. The practices that he is concerned
about will still be legal. Indeed, under Clause 5, some mutilations are
banned. However, a number of practices which involve the short-term
suffering of the animal on the mountain have a longer-term gain. It is
custom and practice, and it works: the animals benefit from it. A
number of mutilations&#151;that is the technical word&#151;in the
interests of good husbandry should therefore be permitted in mountain
and moorland circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102316000127"></a>There are obviously going to be some
regulations, referred to by the noble Duke, which will go out to public
consultation in the next few weeks, enabling them to come into force
next April. The general point that I have made, however&#151;that we
do not intend to outlaw traditional practices of husbandry in the
interests of the animals&#151;is sufficient for this short debate and
the issues raised.</p><p><a name="06102316000128"></a><b><a name="61023-0002.htm_spnew57"></a><a name="06102316000728"></a>The

what is done, such as a shepherd finding a lamb over a week old and

allay our fears, but he has not taken my fears away completely. It will
be difficult to decide the fate of an animal when it is small and to
know whether it will be a working dog. I also question whether all
working dogs need to have their tails docked. I understand that police
dogs, which are often German Shepherds, do not normally have their
tails docked, and they do all kind of things that might be dangerous to
them. I remain very disappointed. I believe that the Bill originally
ended the docking of dogs&#146; tails, and this provision is much
less than I hoped

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1000"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1000</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102316000148"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords,
Amendment No. 6 concerns circus animals and is similar to an amendment
I tabled in Committee. These Benches believe that obliging the
Government to licence the kinds of animals which they consider suitable
for life in a travelling circus is a stronger starting point. A number
of welfare organisations&#151;Animal Defenders International, the
RSPCA and the Born Free Foundation&#151;agree that the
Government&#146;s decision to use a circus working group to consider
the welfare needs of animals is a useful way forward. However, like
those NGOs, we believe that the measure would be simpler and more
effective if the burden of proof were on those who would legitimise the
use of a kind of animal, as this amendment suggests, rather than
assuming that all animals should be available for travelling circuses
and the working group then discussing which sorts of animals it should
ban.</p><p><a name="06102316000149"></a>If a positive list were
produced, it would get around the problem of the collection of
evidence. If one wants to ban using an animal, there will have to be
evidence of cruelty. It would be much simpler if an animal had to be
shown to be suitable. The amendment would require those who would
include a kind of animal to bring proof of the potential to meet its
welfare needs, rather than oblige others to go searching for abuses.
That is important because the itinerant nature of a travelling circus
makes it hard to track the welfare of an animal at all times. The Bill
must provide for an animal&#146;s welfare in performances, at rest
and on the road. It has consistently proven difficult for scientists to
investigate the whole working life of circus animals. This amendment
would look after the needs of domesticated and exotic species alike. At
the moment, only a handful of circuses in the UK use animals, so it
would not be a hard task to work with those practitioners to verify
their good welfare standards where they are met.</p><p><a name="06102316000150"></a>A brief from the RSPCA tells us that the
minimum display pen sizes advocated by the Association of Circus
Proprietors of Great Britain for big cats, bears, zebras, camels, pygmy
hippos, giraffes, elephants and primates are, on average, 70 per cent
smaller than the recommended outdoor enclosure sizes in zoos. Why, if
there is a minimum recommended size and the animals are of the same
species, should there be that double
standard?</p><h5><a name="06102316000655"></a>3.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102316000151"></a>The
Minister will be aware that, in the other place, Early Day Motion 1626
calls for the prohibition of animals in circuses now and has received
144 signatures. My amendment does not go that far. It recognises that
the Bill is a framework Bill and that there is a circus working group,
and therefore does not call for a complete ban. It calls for a standard
of proof of welfare to be required where animals are used, rather than
the more difficult and costly proof of abuse. I should appreciate a
commitment from the Minister that the remit of the circus working group
will be changed in line with that. It is a minor modification to change
the remit of the working group, but the benefits will be very great. I
beg to move.</p>

and agree with all her remarks. As I said more than once in Committee,
I am a prohibitionist. I think&#151;and there is some evidence to
show that my thoughts are right&#151;that travelling circuses train
animals cruelly, at least initially. When moving about the country with
various groups of animals, they fail to provide the basic standards for
an entertainment situation.</p><p><a name="06102316000153"></a>The
amendment represents a minor but useful change. The circus working
group should be quickly established. I am disappointed that the
Government throughout the Bill have dealt with almost all issues by
regulation. That is very unsatisfactory. The evidence is clearly that,
in the main, circuses are cruel to animals and that the beasts are
inadequately looked after. The noble Baroness should be supported in
all her
remarks.</p><p><a name="06102316000154"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew68"></a><a name="06102316000739"></a>Baroness

amendment that has been proposed. It is moderate because, like the
noble Lord, I am basically an abolitionist in this matter. I am
concerned not only about training methods but especially about the
stress caused through travelling, especially under difficult
conditions. I very much hope that the Minister will look kindly on the
amendment and that, if it is unacceptable, he will at least bring
forward something very akin to it.</p><p><a name="06102316000155"></a>I should have declared a non financial

the Government have been very restrained in the Bill as a whole. I am
uncomfortable with the way it has been dealt with in that regard. That
said, a circus with performing animals has by definition at least to be
providing a totally unnatural life for the animals concerned and almost
certainly involves
cruelty.</p><p><a name="06102316000158"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew71"></a><a name="06102316000742"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, we, too, look favourably on the
amendment. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer,
knows, in Committee I moved an amendment totally to ban the use of wild
animals in circuses. Obviously things have moved on since then. We are
lucky in that time has passed between stages of the Bill. I would be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification of one or two matters
when he responds.</p><p><a name="06102316000159"></a>There are
currently two working groups on circuses. One, I believe, deals only
with the welfare standards of performing animals. I also understand
that another group was set up in July/August, chaired by Mike Radford,
to consider scientific evidence of the welfare of those animals. We now
hear that another working group may be set up. I am becoming
confused about the number of working groups and 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1002"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1002</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>study groups there are, and it would be enormously helpful if the
Minister could clarify this. The Government&#146;s decisions on these
issues must be based on scientific evidence; otherwise it is very
difficult to make
judgments.</p><p><a name="06102316000160"></a>I
was glad to hear the noble Baroness say that the working group&#146;s
remit will be altered to include the training of these animals. I was
not aware of that. Again, will the Minister clarify that?</p><p><a name="06102316000161"></a>I should add that it seems, unless the
Minister tells me to the contrary, that no animals from the wild are
put to perform in circuses. If that is not so, that is another worrying
matter. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
answers.</p><p><a name="06102316000162"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="06102316000743"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, this issue has been debated at
every stage of the Bill. It is good to report, although I accept that
it never goes far enough, that our timetable for producing regulations
on wild animals in circuses is now 2008&#151;it used to be
2010&#151;as a result of pressure from the Committee of your
Lordships&#146; House.</p><p><a name="06102316000163"></a>As we
just heard in the past two minutes, many people feel very strongly
about this issue. Since the issue was last discussed in Grand
Committee&#151;I believe in July&#151;the Defra working group,
chaired by Mike Radford, the academic lawyer with extensive knowledge
of welfare issues, has started work. The group is gathering and
reviewing relevant available scientific evidence on the welfare needs
of non-domesticated animals in environments comparable with a circus.
It plans to report its findings early next year, and our aim is that
draft regulations should go to consultation towards the middle of next
year, with the aim of being brought into force in April 2008. That is
two years earlier than originally planned. We cannot produce all the
regulations at once. That is simply impossible. The resources are not
there, and there must be prioritisation. Indeed, the priorities have
changed as a result of pressure from
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06102316000164"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Miller, proposes a total ban with exemptions, but we believe that
Clause 12 is sufficiently wide to enable us to achieve through
secondary legislation the result that she seeks. There is no reason why
a Clause 12 regulation could not achieve the same result as a ban with
exemptions. I therefore do not rule out a total ban. I would not do so.
Nor do the Government; Ben Bradshaw, the Minister concerned, made that
absolutely clear. However, having asked a group of professional people
to look at this, it would not make sense to pre-empt their findings or
those of the subsequent public consultation on the issue. By
definition, there will be a public consultation because of the
regulations. I have been on the receiving end of many
representations&#151;indeed, I have made them myself&#151;and we
have given a commitment to ban the use of certain non-domesticated
species in travelling circuses and to ensure that the standards that
are applied to zoo premises are applied to permanent circus premises,
provided that that is appropriate. We have begun, as I say, examining
the available evidence with affected and interested parties. The Bill
is enabling and a lot of the work will done by secondary legislation
which becomes highly targeted and more detailed
than can

that we reached in Grand Committee, and I therefore hope that the
provision will be acceptable to the House. We have moved the timing
priority considerably. There is no question but that the objective
sought in this amendment can be achieved under the

the Bill, which is exactly why I have moved my amendment. Although it
is good that the priority has moved, the Minister has not reassured me
that the emphasis has changed one bit. He said that there is no reason
why the Bill could not achieve the objective, but, equally, there is no
guarantee that it will be achieved without the change proposed in the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102316000166"></a>I thank all noble

groups&#151;although I am not sure that he gave the noble Baroness,
Lady Byford, a full answer on what they would address. I will consider
the position between now and Third Reading. I believe that the mood of
the House is that the amendment is modest and merely trying to be more
specific about the remit of the working group in pointing it to
improving welfare standards. The Minister said, crucially, that the
equalisation between zoo and circus facilities would apply to circus
permanent facilities. However, I was talking about circus travelling
facilities. So I fear that the reply is lacking in that respect. I will
bear all those points in mind for Third Reading. I hope that, in the
mean time, the Minister will give us a fuller reply on the exact remit
of the working groups.</p><p><a name="06102316000167"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="06102316000745"></a>Lord

that the membership list in front of me is a matter of public record.
If it is not available, it certainly ought to be. I am certain that it
is. I will ensure that a note is prepared both on the remit and
certainly on the membership. Although the group has started work, some

noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment concerns an entirely
different area of animal keeping and I return to the keeping of game
birds for egg production, which I raised in Committee. As I explained
then, I am of course aware that there are strict regulations in place
specifying the minimum size of cages for chickens for egg laying
production. The European prohibition of conventional battery cages for
egg laying hens is due to come into force in 2012, under Council
Directive 1999/74. However, there are no binding specifications for
cages for game birds. Although these birds are brought in from the wild
and then kept for egg production&#151;albeit for a limited period of
time&#151;there is still no reason why there should be such a double
standard for the conditions in which they are
kept.</p><h5><a name="06102316000656"></a>3.45

League Against Cruel Sports, Animal Aid and the British Association for
Shooting and Conservation over the use of caged systems, and want to
ensure that anything used to house game birds provides appropriate
welfare for the birds&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/5/06;

that statement. I am sure that the Minister and his team will have had
further discussions about this issue and I hope that a statement will
be forthcoming today. If welfare is at the core of the Bill at Clause 9
but the battery cages for game birds fail to meet its requirements on
several counts, it would be very unfortunate.
<p><a name="06102316000173"></a>Here again we are slightly in the
territory that lies between what is a farmed animal and what is a wild
animal. For example, the normal behaviour patterns in pheasants include
flight and running territorially and, obviously, those are all severely
curtailed by cages. Pain, injury, disease and suffering are all the
more likely in battery cages and all kinds of abnormal behaviour might
be caused by them.</p><p><a name="06102316000174"></a>I have
slightly adapted the amendment I tabled in Committee so that Amendment
No. 6 is more in line with the wishes of the noble Duke, the Duke of
Montrose. He said in Committee that I was trying to put something
specific in the Bill and
that,</p><ul><a name="06102316000640"></a>&#147;if by doing so
she is ensuring that government powers are to be circumscribed in this
area, on these Benches we would have rather more sympathy with that

Duke.<p><a name="06102316000175"></a>I have tabled the
amendment so that I might ask the Minister some very specific questions
in order to throw light on his discussions on this very important
topic. Has his department looked at the Danish law on minimum spacing
for game birds in egg production? Can he confirm that the last outbreak
of

caged birds? How many game farmers who use cages are not members of the
Game Farmers&#146; Association? Which does he think is the better
system&#151;open flock pens or battery cages? Will he rule out
reference to the Farm Animal Welfare Council by the working group as,
of course, game birds do not count as farmed animals? What information
does he have on the length of time partridges are kept in cages? Can he
confirm that the only motive for using battery cages is to reduce costs
for game farmers and the large commercial
shoots?</p><p><a name="06102316000176"></a>As to that last point,
most shoots of course do not use battery cages; most are small
businesses using traditional practices and manage the land to the great
benefit of biodiversity. I am not addressing here the vast majority of
the shooting industry, which I think both economically and
environmentally bring large benefits to the countryside; I am
addressing only a handful of very large egg producers using battery

into disrepute. I beg to

Duke of Montrose:</b> My Lords, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said, we considered this
issue in Grand Committee. I think that this amendment has a little more
scope to it than the previous one. It does not try to comprehend all
that could be included in a code of conduct and allows flexibility for
different norms for different species, but, once again, perhaps we are
in danger of overlooking the overall quality of the
environment.</p><p><a name="06102316000178"></a>I take a slightly
different view from the noble Baroness on the question of the drawing
up of a code of conduct. I would like to ask the Minister whether the
department has already taken up the suggestion of the Game Conservancy
Trust to view the possibility of a code with the Farm Animal Welfare
Council because it does have some experience in the welfare of animals
and what could be drawn up in that regard. The code will also have to
include all the latest available research. In that regard, the
Minister&#146;s view that most of this could be contained in
secondary legislation is probably
correct.</p><p><a name="06102316000179"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="06102316000749"></a>Lord
Christopher:</b> My Lords, I acknowledge that it is
important to distinguish between what I will call
&#147;traditional&#148; shoots and those which have grown up very
largely around large cities, particularly London, which appear to be
very little more than live shooting practice. In Committee I said that
the scale of some of these establishments is such that there is
literally no market for what is shot, and the birds are buried in large
numbers. There is no evidence, although a photograph has been produced.
I wonder whether my noble friend has been able to establish the truth
of this.</p><p><a name="06102316000180"></a>The amendment does not
cover my next point, although there is no real reason why it should in
the context of what the noble Baroness said. I am not sure whether
raising pheasants and partridge in cages is exclusively linked to cost,
although cost is clearly a factor, or whether it is linked to the
necessity of some of the shoots I am describing to maximise the number
of guns, which could produce some results for the

fraternity that, according to acreage and the rest of it, there should
be a limit on the number of guns allowed so that the shoot does not
simply provide live shooting
practice.</p><p><a name="06102316000181"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06102316000750"></a>The
Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, I declare an enormous
interest in that I run a shoot 10 days a year, and we put down quite a
large number of birds. The last outbreak of Newcastle disease was about
a mile and a half from where I live. I am pretty certain, although I
would not go to the stake for it, that the outbreak occurred after six
week-old poults had been bought because, if I remember rightly, it was
in July. It was dealt with immensely efficiently by the landowner, his
keeper and Defra, and the disease did not spread. Well done
Defra&#151;one should give credit where it is due.</p><p><a name="06102316000182"></a>I have heard the story about pheasants
being buried; it has been around for a very long time. I am pretty
certain it is an urban myth. Someone says, &#147;I wonder if they
do&#148; and by teatime it has become, &#147;I know the chap who
did it&#148;. I have heard that story for 10 years now and have seen
no evidence, although I know you cannot prove a
negative.</p><p><a name="06102316000183"></a>It
is certainly true that the price of pheasants has gone through the
floor. I took over my father&#146;s shoot 30 years ago; we got
&#163;1 for each pheasant in the middle of the season then, and we
still get &#163;1 each, if we are lucky, in the middle of the season.
That is due to the fact that the bags have increased, as the noble Lord
says. But I think that the majority of people rear their pheasants as I
do. The laying pens are a big area, and bushes are brought in for the
birds to hide under. There is protection from, funnily enough, sparrow
hawks; it is perfectly legal, they are scared away with netting. It is
in everybody&#146;s interests that the laying pens are as decently
run as possible and free of
disease.</p><p><a name="06102316000184"></a>If there is proved to
be a need for regulations for people using battery methods, I can see
nothing wrong with that. If we want to go on running shoots, we have to
do it properly and in a way that everybody can approve. If the need is
shown to be there, I see nothing wrong in having regulations for
minimum
standards.</p><p><a name="06102316000185"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06102316000751"></a>Lord

Fund when we come to consider those
matters.</p><p><a name="06102316000186"></a>This amendment is quite
unnecessary. Defra is already drawing up a code which covers the
rearing of game birds. It will take advice from the Game Conservancy
Trust. I have great confidence that it will come up with the right
answer. However, this amendment is quite unnecessary and comes at the

the end of 2009. That is a direct result of pressure from your
Lordships&#146; Grand
Committee.</p><p><a name="06102316000188"></a>I
have not seen the photographs to which my noble friend Lord Christopher
referred, so I do not know whether, as the noble Earl said, it is an
urban myth&#151;it could well be so. An astonishing number of birds
is released each year. The figure is between 20 million and 35 million.
Around 40 per cent of pheasants for rearing come from France as eggs or
day-old chicks. There is a small trade in six-to-eight-week-old poults.
Approximately 90 per cent of redleg partridge are imported, the
majority from France, but some also from Spain and Poland. The question
of rearing practices for birds released as game birds therefore goes
outside the country. I hope that my update is to the noble
Baroness&#146;s satisfaction: the Government have looked at this
issue closely since Grand
Committee.</p><p><a name="06102316000189"></a>We
are sympathetic towards the purpose of the amendment&#151;there is no
question about that&#151;but it is mistake to insert the new clause
simply because it is too inflexible. We intend to introduce a code of
practice for game bird-rearing within the next two years, but to
require it to be established within 18 months of the enactment of the
Bill will certainly pre-empt the results of the game bird research
which has been commissioned by Defra to inform the code. We want the
code to be based on
evidence.</p><p><a name="06102316000190"></a>There is little
scientific evidence about what is required for good game bird welfare,
including minimum space requirements, but the Game Conservancy Trust is
conducting research into the use of certain practices as management
tools. As the noble Earl, Lord Peel, indicated in Grand Committee, the
Farm Animal Welfare Council intends to study the breeding and rearing
of game birds, including the use of the raised laying units to which
reference was made. It will report back to us in the summer of 2008.
Those results will be far too close to the 18-month deadline set by the
amendment to enable us to draft the
code.</p><p><a name="06102316000191"></a>In some ways, the noble
Earl, Lord Onslow, hit the nail on the head. The code is needed. While
there might be a shortage of scientific evidence, a lot of good
practical knowledge exists about welfare in rearing game birds. We are
talking about a scale of release of between 20 million and 35 million
and a large expansion in production, as clearly indicated by the price
going through the floor. Game birds are more widely available in
butchers&#146; shops than was the case when most of us were a lot
younger. Certainly, people on my side of the road could not afford
them.</p><p><a name="06102316000192"></a><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06102316000753"></a>The

further to define under Clause 9 the sort of animal that is being dealt
with when, for example, taking into account the need for a suitable
environment. In debating Amendment No. A1 we made passing reference to
degrees of domestication. Where the animal is a long-time domestic
companion 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1009"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1009</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to man, such as a cat or a dog, it is fairly easy to judge whether its
needs are met against all the criteria in the clause. We are used to
their needs, which have been known over time, and it will be clear when
somebody is failing to provide a suitable diet or environment, for
example. However, at the other end of the spectrum are those animals
that have never fallen within the definition of
&#147;domesticated&#148; and might be wild, caught animals. We
debated in Committee the issues of wild, caught birds and of primates.
The needs of those creatures will be vastly
different.</p><p><a name="06102316000205"></a>In
Committee the Minister did not seem to accept the need for any
differentiation. Having thought about the issue and worked on it over
time, I believe much more strongly than I did that this amendment is
absolutely essential to the adequate functioning of the Bill. My
amendment will ensure that in the codes for non-domesticated species
that are kept as pets&#151;we have not been offered codes for them in
the Bill&#151;the fact that they are essentially wild or
semi-domesticated animals will have to be taken into account.</p><p><a name="06102316000206"></a>An episode that highlighted this vital
distinction for me was when the Minister&#146;s team of advisers was
debating this issue with, I believe, the RSPCA. One of the team
commented that there was no difference in welfare needs between
domesticated horses and zebras. Self-evidently, there is a difference.
Zebras have never been used to domestication of any sort. They have not
been selected for generations to be comfortable with human company.
Their needs under the five freedoms, especially the need to exhibit
natural behaviours, will therefore be much more difficult to satisfy in
a domestic setting than, say, those of a horse.</p><p><a name="06102316000207"></a>My amendment does not
say that domestication should be the only consideration for welfare
needs&#151;far from it. But there is a growing body of scientific
backing to suggest that the needs of non-domesticated species will be
different in terms of type and/or scale from those of domesticated
animals. For example, in 2002, data produced by Mr Edward Price pointed
to the conclusion that the single most important effect of
domestication on behaviour is reduced emotional reactivity or
responsiveness to fear-invoking stimuli&#151;that is in
scientific-speak. Evidently, if one has small children banging their
drums, the family dog is unlikely to react because it is probably
pretty used to it. However, if a fairly fragile animal has recently
been imported into the household from essentially a wild background, it
certainly will react. It will not have the room to flee from what it
finds a frightening situation, therefore the requirement under Clause 9
to provide &#147;a suitable environment&#148; would not be
met.</p><p><a name="06102316000208"></a>The needs of African grey
parrots are substantially greater than those of most domesticated
species; for example, budgerigars. A parrot in captivity is routinely
denied two of its most fundamental natural behaviours: flying long
distances and socialisation. Research by Engbretson published this year
by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare suggests that denying
a bird vocal, visual and physical contact with its conspecifics can
contribute to abnormal behaviour and stereotypy. These birds normally
congregate in large flocks.</p>

scientist, but the point I am getting at is that no amount of human
contact can make up for the fact that these animals are being denied
their normal behaviour, and therefore their needs would be unlikely to
be met under Clause 9 if you could take into account the degree of
domestication, because it is a key concept in assessing suitability of
environment. Indeed, in preparing this amendment, the concept of
domestication has very helpfully already been detailed in the guidance
notes to the 2002 amendment to the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, so the
Government have already considered the question of degree. Five
categories are set out, ranging from true domestic breeds to true wild
species. The work has been done on this. It is not as if the Government
have to start from scratch; they have definitions they can choose to
use.</p><p><a name="06102316000210"></a>The Bill is not an
exercise in artistic draftsmanship, and those who come to interpret it
really need to be able to appreciate and put into practice the
difference in the standard of care required by best practice to cater
particularly for non-domesticated species. Noble Lords who were here
for the discussion in Committee on the keeping of primates as pets, for
example, will have appreciated it. I will not rehearse any of the
arguments I used then, because of course we are on Report. All I am
asking the Government to do now is to recognise that there will have to
be a very careful interpretation of the Bill, and to protect those most
vulnerable animals that I believe they are as interested in protecting
as I am. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06102316000211"></a><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="06102316000759"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, I also spoke on this issue in
Committee, when we discussed in depth caught wild birds and primates.
While I have sympathy with the ethos behind the amendment, it seems to
me that paragraphs (a),(b),(c),(d) and (e) of Clause 9(2) would cover
the matter. Surely anybody having to decide on the matter would know
very well that a primate&#146;s needs and a parrot&#146;s needs are
very different from those of other animals which are normally
domesticated. The noble Baroness shakes her head. I shall be interested
to hear what the Minister has to say. I still have strong reservations
about caught wild birds, which are not dealt with specifically here
but, unless the Minister tells me otherwise, I should have thought that
paragraphs (a) to (e) covered the
matter.</p><p><a name="06102316000212"></a><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06102316000760"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I confirm that that is the
case. I assure the noble Baroness that we consider the matter to be
covered by the Bill. As we have not convinced the noble Baroness, Lady
Miller of Chilthorne Domer, before I use my set piece I shall address
the seductive point that she raised regarding the Zoo Licensing Act, on
which I have taken advice.</p><p><a name="06102316000213"></a>The
noble Baroness said that the Zoo Licensing Act provided a list of
domesticated and non-domesticated animals. This list, however, is not
an authoritative statement. The guidance is explicit&#151;the list is
the department&#146;s informal view of what animals might be classed
as wild animals for the purpose of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 (as
amended). Under this legislation &#147;wild animals&#148; means
animals not normally domesticated in Great Britain. It was felt 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1011"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1011</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary to provide this guidance to aid authorities in determining
what types of establishment might require a zoo licence under the 1981
Act. For example, a collection of animals consisting entirely of types
normally domesticated in Great Britain is not a zoo within the meaning
of the Act. This list was not drawn up to highlight welfare differences
between the species mentioned. Indeed, the Secretary of State&#146;s
Standards of Modern Zoo Practice guidance is equally clear that the
welfare needs of animals in zoos can be met by adhering to the five
freedoms drawn up for livestock by the Farm Animal Welfare Council,
which are broadly reflected in the five welfare needs as highlighted in
this clause.</p><p><a name="06102316000214"></a>The amendment seeks
to add a further paragraph to Clause 9. Its central aim is to instruct
a court that in considering whether a welfare offence has been
committed it should have regard to the degree of domestication of an
animal. We do not think that the amendment is necessary because these
issues will be dealt with by a court as appropriate under the
legislation as drafted.</p><p><a name="06102316000215"></a>The
special needs of some animals kept by man were discussed at length in
Grand Committee. We were all agreed that different animals have
different needs and therefore required different kinds and degrees of
care. We also debated amendments that sought to instruct the courts to
take into account whether an animal was non-domesticated. I confirm to
one noble Baroness and reassure the other that whether an animal is of
a kind commonly regarded as domesticated or non-domesticated will be an
inherent consideration in ascertaining what its needs are under Clause
9(2), for the purpose of determining whether its needs have been met.
It is entirely appropriate for a court to take that into
account.</p><h5><a name="06102316000658"></a>4.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06102316000216"></a>It would be
unacceptable to seek to ascertain a non-domesticated animal&#146;s
needs without having regard to the fact that they are of a species that
is not commonly domesticated in the British islands, where this is
relevant. However, it will not always be relevant, and it could
therefore be a mistake to require a court always to have regard to it.
For example, if a prosecution was brought because an owner failed to
provide water for their animal, the amendment would require the degree
of domestication of the animal to be taken into account, even though
that is not relevant. All animals need water, and a failure to provide
water for an animal for which you are responsible would breach the
offence, whether or not the animal is domesticated. To this extent, the
amendment could cause confusion and legally be a problem. I assure the
House that the clause as drafted does allow the courts to contemplate
&#147;degrees of domestication&#148;&#151;it is for the court to
decide&#151;as one of the circumstances in deciding whether the
offence has been breached.</p><p><a name="06102316000217"></a>By highlighting the
degree of domestication, the amendment risks narrowing the clause by
implication, because that factor and not others is mentioned. There is
potentially a really serious problem in seeking to limit the clause in
this way. It should also not be assumed that non-domesticated species
necessarily have 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1012"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1012</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more complex needs than domesticated species; they are clearly
different. The regulations and codes of practice that we produce will
provide greater clarity about what is required for particular types of
animal, including non-domesticated species. The codes will provide, if
necessary, any additional guidance that may be needed to ensure the
welfare of non-domesticated animals.</p><p><a name="06102316000218"></a>If necessary, there
is a power in Clause 12 to make regulations setting specific
requirements with regard to a particular animal&#146;s needs, so it
is covered in the Bill in a double lock. Clause 9 makes it implicit and
inherent that the needs will be taken into account by the courts. In
Clause 12, there is the power to make regulations setting a specific
requirement with regard to a particular animal&#146;s needs. What
exactly constitutes the appropriate welfare standard will vary
according to the circumstances, and the Bill already requires the
courts to consider all the
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102316000219"></a>After
careful consideration and scrutiny by Parliament, we have formulated a
clause that is as flexible and as capable as possible of addressing the
needs of all types of animals&#151;we are concerned about them
all&#151;for which a person may be responsible in the many different
circumstances that may arise. The flexibility is needed for the courts
to do their job so that, if you like, those who wish not to treat
animals properly cannot find legalistic loopholes in a clause that is
drafted a bit too narrowly because it does not allow the courts to look
at all the circumstances. On that basis, I sincerely urge the noble
Baroness to withdraw her
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102316000220"></a><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="06102316000761"></a>Baroness

I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reply. I took very much to
heart last year the words of one of his predecessors at Defra, Mr Jim
Knight, who in talking about the importation of wild birds, said that
the Government needed to &#147;raise the bar&#148; on the standards
that had to be met. The Minister has given the perhaps slightly
disingenuous example of whether water was supplied. The question of a
suitable environment or the need to exhibit normal behaviour patterns
would have been a much fairer example with which to reply. The response
of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, surprises me, because her colleague
in another place, Mr Jim Paice, has been extremely vociferous about the
issue of wild caught birds, and he would have felt very strongly about
supporting the spirit of the amendment.</p><p><a name="06102316000221"></a>Of course, the Minister may say that the
way in which the amendment is drafted would weaken the clause, but it
was open to him to bring forward something that his experts might have
found more suitable. I think he is saying that he finds the whole
concept unnecessary and
unsuitable.</p><p><a name="06102316000222"></a><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew91"></a><a name="06102316000762"></a>Lord

clause to meet the widest number of circumstances, so that a
court&#151;I repeat, a court&#151;can take into account all the
relevant circumstances of the animal, whatever its level of
domestication. That is important. Anything that narrowed the clause
would diminish that; so her description was the opposite of the case
that I was making.</p>

Nothing in this section applies to the offering of a goldfish as a
prize.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06102316000235"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, on the face of it, this amendment may seem
frivolous, but I assure noble Lords that that is far from the case, as
many youngsters up and down the country would testify. The three of us
who have tabled the amendment are all members of the All-Party Group on
Fairs and Showgrounds and we work closely with the Showmen&#146;s
Guild of Great Britain, a responsible body that represents more than
20,000 people in that profession. I know that it is fully behind the
objectives of this amendment, which is designed to combat the purpose
of the original amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Baroness,
Lady Miller of Chilthorne
Domer.</p><p><a name="06102316000236"></a>In
Committee, I related my experience of winning a goldfish as a schoolboy
at the Merrie England amusement arcade in Ramsgate. The fish was well
looked after until it died, which was, I should tell noble Lords, from
natural causes. Before that happened, the fish brought great joy not
only to me, but to my brothers and sister. I know from correspondence
that I have received since the Committee stage that my sentiments and
those of the noble Lords, Lord Bilston and Lord Hoyle, are shared by
many hundreds of people in this country.</p><p><a name="06102316000237"></a>I said in Committee
that the amendment then proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of
Chilthorne Domer, went over the top. At the end of our debate, she
withdrew her amendment on the grounds, I hope, of the strength of our
arguments, particularly that of the noble Lord, Lord
Hoyle&#151;unfortunately, he cannot be here today, as he is stuck in
a traffic jam&#151;who requested that we should return to this issue
on Report with a suitable amendment. That is where we are
today.</p><p><a name="06102316000238"></a>I sincerely hope that
sense will prevail and that the practice of allowing goldfish to be won
as prizes will continue. The Showmen&#146;s Guild of Great Britain
has taken measures to ensure that anyone who wins a goldfish as a prize
is presented with a leaflet drawn up by the RSPCA and headed
&#147;Care of Goldfish&#148;, which provides advice on how to care
for the fish. The RSPCA is surely the kind of body that this House
should listen to, alongside my noble friends and me. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102316000239"></a><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="06102316000772"></a>The

11 sets out to regulate the transfer of animals to those under 16
through selling them or offering them as prizes. Subsection (3)
specifically outlaws the making of an arrangement by which someone who
is reasonably believed to be under 16 is given a chance to win an
animal as a prize. Subsection (5), however, excludes an arrangement
made in the absence of the potential prize-winner, provided that the
party offering

agrees to the arrangement.</p><p><a name="06102316000241"></a>The idea of offering
an animal as a prize to someone whom one has not seen and whose
circumstances one does not know is abhorrent to most people&#151;and
even goldfish have come in for a tide of sympathy recently, although,
as the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, has shown us, there are good arguments
for defending the practice. In Committee, the Minister referred to the
sorts of competition that, for example, are run in a horse magazine to
win a pony. As I said, offering a sentient being as a prize to a person
whom one has not met and about whose circumstances one has no
knowledge, but who one has reason to believe is under 16, is not
acceptable to many or, I hope, most people.</p><p><a name="06102316000242"></a>If a magazine were to do that, the
likelihood is that there would be a written entry containing a name and
address so that a responsible competition manager would be able to
check with an adult before dispatching the animal, whether by courier
or in a horsebox. On the internet, however, things are not so black and
white, and any Bill concerned with animal welfare must be framed to
take account of the more modern ways in which all sorts of deals are
struck. By what means will a competition ensure that a child who posts
a winning entry has the permission of a responsible adult to accept the
prize?</p><p><a name="06102316000243"></a>The Minister continued
his response in Committee by
saying:</p><ul><a name="06102316000535"></a>&#147;Those under 16
should not be able to win such competitions unless they have the
consent of a responsible adult&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
24/5/06; GC 241.]</ul><a name="06102316000499"></a>That is my
point entirely. However, he did not enlighten us about how, over the
internet, such a possibility would be outlawed and the award of the
animals monitored.

amendment would allow a person to completely disregard welfare when
offering a goldfish as a prize. Effectively, it sets aside the core
values of the Bill for one species chosen arbitrarily simply because of
the fond memories held by some Members of your Lordships' House. I
understand how they have managed to be very persuasive but, ultimately,
the opinion of the scientists who have worked on the Bill, and whom the
Minister has been very ready to quote to me this afternoon, is that
vertebrate animals, including goldfish, are demonstrably sentient. We
on these Benches do not feel that it would be consistent to go against
that advice, however much some Members may feel us to be
killjoys.</p>

response to the amendments tabled from the Conservative Benches, which
I thought raised some interesting
issues.</p><p><a name="06102316000248"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="06102316000775"></a>Lord
Bilston:</b> My Lords, I had hoped that the noble
Baroness, Lady Miller, would have been persuaded by the very powerful
arguments that we advanced in Committee with regard to goldfish. Again,
I acknowledge, as I am sure all noble Lords do, that the welfare issue
goes wider than simply in relation to goldfish. I felt that we made a
good case about both the welfare and employment elements relating to
goldfish. We pointed out then, as I point out again to noble Lords
today, that more than 20,000 people are employed at funfairs and
through the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain. I am not saying that all
their jobs would be in jeopardy but, if it were decided to ban goldfish
as prizes at fairgrounds, there is no doubt that some would be. If the
case were made that the welfare considerations were enormous, then we
would have to accept the loss of those jobs, but, as we sought to point
out to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and as I hope to point out to
the House today, there are no serious welfare issues with regard to
goldfish.</p><p><a name="06102316000249"></a>As I pointed out in
Committee, it is 50 years since the Showmen&#146;s Guild of Great
Britain passed a resolution to its constitution ensuring that all its
members took account of the welfare of goldfish. It includes keeping
them in a suitable container and passing them on to a winning
competitor also in an appropriate container. That duty of care is
enshrined in the guild&#146;s constitution. In addition, every time a
goldfish is awarded, the winner is given a copy of a leaflet headed
&#147;Care of Goldfish&#148;, drawn up especially by the RSPCA. The
leaflet details how to care properly for the goldfish and how to
provide it with a proper home. The appropriate container also carries
that advice.</p><p><a name="06102316000250"></a>It is part of the
tradition and culture of showgrounds for goldfish to be offered as
prizes. Today, I hope that we can still satisfy noble Lords, as the
Minister satisfied Members in Committee, that there are no real safety
issues. I can understand the noble Baroness being concerned that
children may not take care of the goldfish, but I am sure that there
are not many noble Lords here today who did not, in their childhood,
win a goldfish and care for it. I did. Many of my school friends had a
goldfish and we always took great care to make sure that its health and
welfare was paramount. I hope to hear from my noble friend that we
should not be over-concerned and over-anxious about goldfish being
offered as prizes, and allow that to continue in the interests of our
traditional culture and the important jobs lying behind that
effort.</p><p><a name="06102316000251"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="06102316000776"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am on the side of the
goldfish. Our tradition of giving goldfish as prizes at funfairs will
and should continue. We are doing nothing in the Bill to abolish it. We
are on the side of the funfairs giving goldfish as prizes, to be looked
after well&#151;in bigger bags, maybe. The containers are much

with the prize is absolutely fundamental. It is important that the
welfare of the goldfish is taken into account. It is not a question of
do what you like. I do not think the Showmen&#146;s Guild would
support any of its members promoting anti-welfare practices by offering
unsuitable containers and not giving good advice to the youngsters who
win the prizes. Long may that
continue.</p><p><a name="06102316000252"></a>There
is a technical difficulty. If the amendment were accepted, it would
mean double standards. They would be lower in funfairs than in pet
shops. But there is no issue as long as the welfare of the goldfish is
considered. No offence will be committed, so the tradition can
continue, and there is nothing in the Bill knocking that out. I do not
see it as a problem, but I am grateful to my noble friends for raising
the issue today and in Grand Committee. As I told my noble friend Lord
Bilston the other day, officials in my private office in Defra still
talk about the debate we had in Grand Committee. They remember the day
with joy. I hope that that will be acceptable to my noble
friends.</p><p><a name="06102316000253"></a>This
issue and Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 have already been debated.
Amendment No. 11 would remove subsection (5)(a), which covers
competitions that are not held face-to-face but which are in magazines,
such as horse magazines, or over the internet. These competitions are
often aimed at a section of the public who already have some knowledge
of the animal that they are attempting to win and are therefore likely
to prove responsible owners. Subsection (5)(a) makes provision for
those types of competitions. We believe that the amendment would make
their legality uncertain and could effectively prohibit them, which we
are not in favour of doing.</p><p><a name="06102316000254"></a>We
are not aware of any welfare problems with this type of competition.
One that we have seen in a popular horse magazine promoted welfare as
it tested a child&#146;s knowledge of horse matters, including horse
care. Subsection (5)(b) ensures that the person offering the magazine
prize has reasonable cause to believe that a child under 16 who enters
the competition has sought agreement from their parent or guardian.
This safeguard is present in existing magazine competitions in that the
application requires parental endorsement. The effect of the amendment
would leave subsection (5)(b) as a stand-alone provision that could,
for example, be applied to a stallholder at a funfair. In many cases,
it would be totally unreasonable for the stallholder offering fish as a
prize to know whether or not the parent or guardian is content for the
child to win the goldfish. It would therefore be a backdoor method of
trying to impose a total ban on giving pets as prizes. That is why some
noble Lords thought that there was an attempt by the original promoters
of the amendment to be
anti-goldfish.</p><p><a name="06102316000255"></a>On
Amendment No. 12, the purpose of subsection (6) is to allow a prize to
be offered in a family context; given, for example, by one family
member to another as a reward or prize. The term &#147;family&#148;
may refer to a relative but each situation can be different depending
on individual circumstances. It could also be taken to 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1018"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1018</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>include a partner of a child&#146;s parent. We have not restricted
ourselves in defining &#147;family&#148;, as this term will need to
cover a range of situations. It most cases, it will be obvious where
the term should be applied.</p><p><a name="06102316000256"></a>There is no
justification for the state to interfere in harmless arrangements
between family members, especially where the person held legally
responsible for the care of the animal on the child&#146;s behalf
will, in most cases, be aware of the arrangements and have to have
taken responsibility for ensuring that the welfare needs of the animals
will be met. It is not a free for all just because it is a family. That
is crucial. The welfare needs of the animal must still be
met.</p><p><a name="06102316000257"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew106"></a><a name="06102316000777"></a>Lord

noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment deals with inspectors and
where an improvement notice might be added. It would enable an
inspector to amend an improvement notice. It is intended to allow
mistakes from simple drafting errors or errors of description to be
corrected. Allowing the amendment of an improvement notice will reap
benefits for the continued monitoring of animal welfare. It would
ensure that, where there was a need to extend coverage of an
improvement notice, that could be done by amending the
notice.</p><p><a name="06102316000263"></a>At one
stage, I was lobbied and asked whether I would agree to the cancelling
of an improvement notice. I was unhappy with that, because the
improvement notice gives people time to correct errors in the treatment
of that particular animal, and make whatever improvements they should
be capable of. In discussion with various groups, particularly the
International League for the Protection of Horses, we came up with this
amendment to allow an improvement notice to be amended but not
withdrawn. One would therefore be transposed with the other: we did not
want a cancellation.</p><p><a name="06102316000264"></a>As I said,
the amendment would permit the correction of errors where, for example,
the name of the owner is cited incorrectly or the opinion of a
veterinary surgeon raises the need to redefine the description of harm.
That can be done without the expense of producing another improvement
notice.</p><p><a name="06102316000265"></a>The amendment is
specifically drafted so that it will not be possible to cancel the
improvement notice.

Soulsby, who unfortunately cannot be with us today, tabled an amendment
that would have made non-compliance with an improvement notice an
offence. Our original amendment&#151;then Amendment No.
47&#151;would have allowed the recipient to make an appeal on an
improvement notice. I was satisfied at that stage with the
Minister&#146;s response but the ILPH has since raised these concerns
with me. When the Minister responds, he may also be able to help the
House on a case which I brought to him earlier in the year&#151;that
of Mrs Diane McCluskey, who found abandoned horses and had
great difficulty in having the matter resolved.</p><p><a name="06102316000266"></a>The International League for the
Protection of Horses is very supportive of the Bill and of how it
provides a means of avoiding abuse and cruelty to animals and
increasing the penalties for those who contravene the law. During the
Bill&#146;s passage through the House of Commons some important and
welcome improvements were made; so there are very few issues on which
further amendments are needed. However, one issue remaining is
improvement notices and the ownership of abandoned animals. This small
amendment will improve the Bill. The RSPCA has had cases where an
original improvement notice has proved faulty and needed to be amended
but it could not be. It therefore seems sensible to raise the issue at
this stage and to hear the Government&#146;s response. I beg to

Rooker:</b> My Lords, I did not know until I came to
the Bill that Clause 10, to which the amendment relates, was introduced
in the Commons in response to an opposition proposal that those accused
of an offence should be told in a statutory improvement notice how they
were breaking the law and what they needed to do to avoid being taken
to court. We think that Clause 10 achieves that. However, I am quite
happy to take advice on that, because I need to be absolutely clear
that our views across the Chamber and among outside bodies are at
one.</p><p><a name="06102316000270"></a>We do not think it is
necessary to say anything about the matter in Clause 10 specifically.
If a notice is issued that does not specify the right steps necessary
to comply with the welfare duty, there is nothing in the legislation to
prevent the inspector issuing a new corrected notice. I am advised that
if the

with the welfare duty. The owner is obliged to comply with the
corrected notice or there will be a breach of the welfare duty for
which the owner could be prosecuted. There is nothing stopping an
inspector issuing a new notice to supersede the first one and that is
the notice with which the owner of the animal would have to comply. We
are satisfied that for all practical purposes the clause as drafted
does the trick.</p><p><a name="06102316000271"></a>There is an
incredibly short time between Report and Third Reading, but, bearing in
mind what has been said from both sides of the House, I will make sure
that we have this matter locked down before Third Reading. So if there
is any doubt whatever, we will have a look at this again. The advice I
have is that this amendment is not necessary. The inspector can issue a
new notice with which the owner will be required to comply or face
prosecution. Obviously, it is right that inspectors take care to ensure
that the first notice that they issue covers all the points, but, if
not, they can issue another notice. There is nothing to stop them doing
that.</p><p><a name="06102316000272"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew111"></a><a name="06102316000782"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
and to noble Lords who have supported the amendment. This matter has
arisen in the past and is perhaps not of concern now, but it was raised
with me not just by the International League for the Protection of
Horses but by the RSPCA, which has said that it has put forward some
cases in which the improvement notice has then been found not to be
sufficient for the matter to go to court. I am grateful for the
Minister's offer to look at the matter again. I do not have the details
in black and white in front of me here, but it was raised by two
representatives whom I think have a very good record in these
matters.</p><p><a name="06102316000273"></a>Having taken into
consideration what the Minister has had to say, I highlight the
question of how one knows when one notice ends and another begins.
Presumably, one would be trying to improve on notice A. How will the
person know when notice A is no longer applicable, because notice B has
come along and altered it? There is a three-month period in the Bill to
improve on the notice before any court action can take
place.</p><p><a name="06102316000274"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew112"></a><a name="06102316000783"></a>Lord

the advice that I receive but, as I said, there is nothing stopping an
inspector issuing a new corrected notice on a different date&#151;or,
if, for some reason, they are issued on the same day, the inspector
would time the second notice. The latest notice would be the one to
which the person would have had to operate or be subject to
prosecution. I will check that out and also write to the noble Baroness
on the McCluskey case, concerning horses, that she
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06102316000275"></a><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew113"></a><a name="06102316000784"></a>Baroness

and (e) the maintenance of

noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is perhaps the weightiest of all
the amendments with which I have to deal today. I am very grateful to
the many people who have written to me directly or made comments about
the present and future care of greyhounds. If I may, I shall start by
thanking all of those&#151;the lobby groups and the professional
tracks&#151;for coming back to me. I apologise for the fact that I
shall be slightly lengthy, because we need to set the
scene.</p><p><a name="06102316000279"></a>Under the amendment, we
return to a subject of great concern to me and many other noble Lords.
The amendment represents a departure from our position in Committee,
where we sought to allow self-regulation of the greyhound tracks to
continue but to eliminate non-regulation in the industry by ensuring
that the independent tracks signed up to the industry's regulation. The
new amendment would ensure that the national regulations were rolled
out within two years.</p><p><a name="06102316000280"></a>There have
been many developments in the field since Committee, not least the
shocking expos&#233; in the <I>Sunday Times</I> last August, in which
it was estimated that one man alone had during the past 15 years killed
10,000 retired greyhounds, not letting the owners know what was
happening to their hounds&#151;some thinking that they were being
rehoused when in fact they were being destroyed. It is not necessary
for me to repeat that story; I am sure that many noble Lords have read
it. It is one that horrified me and must have horrified other noble
Lords.</p><p><a name="06102316000281"></a>In the light of that
evidence, and in the light of the Minister's words in Committee, I have
revised my position. However, there are serious flaws in the operation
of the current system. Where a trainer does not abide by the industry
rules as set out by the National Greyhound Racing Club, his licence is
revoked. However, there is nothing to prevent that trainer from
continuing to train dogs or entering those dogs on independent
tracks.</p><p><a name="06102316000282"></a>The
self-regulating greyhound industry is beset by conflicting priorities.
The built-in conflict between welfare and profit has clearly resulted
in the under-funding and under-management of the greyhounds&#146;
welfare. I accept that the NGRC has acted with the very best of
intentions, and that the regulations that it has tried to bring in have
helped, but there is still a long way to go. That conflict of interests
and, I am sorry to say, the disgraceful lack of co-operation shown by
some 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>individuals in the industry make the current situation unworkable.
Although I would have been happy to allow the NGRC to regulate the
industry if it had proved itself able to keep an accurate audit of
retiring greyhounds and to bring independent tracks within the approved
industry, I regret that the evidence at this time persuades me that it
cannot. However, my amendment would give it two years within which to
do so. If the amendment were accepted, and if the industry managed to
achieve what it is setting out to do, it may well have urged the
industry to look further.</p><p><a name="06102316000283"></a>I
understand that the NGRC&#146;s rules of racing do not include a
section on minimum welfare standards. Although elements of its rule
book cover small welfare issues, there is no written code on the
welfare of greyhounds. What is more, although betting points and entry
fees are well represented, there is no official entry on track surface
or layout. The amendment calls for national standards to help to reduce
the number of dogs that are bred for racing, thereby reducing so-called
wastage from the breeding of unsuitable dogs. It would ensure that
veterinary attendance at meetings was mandatory, that there would be an
effective and audited identification scheme for greyhounds, that
greyhound kennels were licensed and that tracks were kept up to
suitable standards for racing.</p><p><a name="06102316000284"></a>I
was heartened to read the Minister&#146;s words in Grand Committee,
where he recognised that,</p><ul><a name="06102316000641"></a>&#147;the regulated sector is making
strong advances in welfare, but I do not think that anyone is saying
that it is perfect&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/5/06;
col. GC224.]</ul><a name="06102316000500"></a>That is right,
and that is still my view. Great attempts at improving welfare have
indeed been made, but the greyhound industry has clearly come far from
its starting point. That starting point, however, was far below a
reasonable standard of welfare.
<p><a name="06102316000285"></a>I hope the Minister recognises that my
amendment would allow for the continued work of the Defra greyhound
welfare working group, as it would allow for regulations to be made,
highlights the essential areas for improvement, and would allow for a
two-year roll-out. I was disappointed by the time scale for the work on
greyhound welfare, as I was by the entire time frame for the codes of
practice that will come to this House for approval after the Bill has
been passed. I also remain far from satisfied that the next instalment
will be next April.</p><p><a name="06102316000286"></a>The
RSPCA&#146;s contribution to us accepts that the Government intend to
introduce regulations that will address these concerns, but it would
welcome the Minister&#146;s confirmation that the regulations will
provide scope for inspectors of tracks and trainers&#146; kennels,
that the Government will make a commitment to ensuring that the
regulation of the industry is open and transparent, and that the public
can have faith in it. Self-regulation is not acceptable to the
RSPCA&#146;s organisations or to the public if the industry fails to
do so. The RPSCA also believes that the inspection process should be
audited to ensure compliance with procedures and the competency of the
inspectors.</p>

<p><a name="06102316000287"></a>It would be
enormously helpful for all of us if, in addition to providing that
clarification, the Minister 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1023"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1023</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might also consider another couple of items. We believe that additional
safeguards need to be touched on. The current working group includes
Hazel Bentall, a veterinary steward for the National Greyhound Racing
Club. In addition to the points already raised, it would like to
include drug testing, regular and random inspection of residential and
racing facilities, comprehensive integration of all relevant records
and a robust audit to ensure the effectiveness of regulation. I know
that some of that is already included, but I should like clarification,
which is why I have proposed this amendment. I do not belittle in any
way the work that has been done. I would like the noble Lord, Lord
Lipsey, in particular, to know
that.</p><h5><a name="06102316000661"></a>5
pm</h5><p><a name="06102316000288"></a>The League Against Cruel
Sports is very concerned and has added its weight. A letter to me
states:</p><ul><a name="06102316000542"></a>&#147;It is the
neglect by the NGRC and the lack of action to address the concerns of
&#145;main-stream&#146; animal welfare organisations, which forms
the basis of arguments against their continued self regulation and
demonstrates the need for statutory regulation to be included on the
face of the Bill&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000501"></a>I
am sure that the Pet Advisory Committee, which has also lobbied me, is
known to many noble Lords. It says that,
<ul><a name="06102316000642"></a>&#147;there is no quality assurance
of the inspection system and no data is provided to show that it is
efficacious&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000502"></a>It is
also concerned about the re-homing of retired greyhounds. It says that
the Retired Greyhound Trust, which is largely funded by the industry,
re-homes 3,500 dogs each year. I understand that other welfare
charities re-home a further 1,500 dogs. Naturally, some owners and
trainers retain dogs as pets when their careers are over, but that
number is not known because of the lack of data on registration and
independent tracks. The trust believes that the figure is unlikely to
be in excess of 3,000, although that is speculative and based on poor
funding at the level of trainers. Therefore, when taking the figures
together, it seems that the fate of some 5,000 to 8,000 greyhounds
annually is unknown.<p><a name="06102316000289"></a>With that
in view, our amendment proposes, under Clause 10, to introduce
licensing of all&#151;I repeat, all&#151;greyhound racing tracks
through the appropriate national authority within two years of the
passing of the Act. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102316000290"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="06102316000786"></a>Lord

Committee: I will give the House my best advice, although I shall not
vote on any amendment. I have taken the view of the House authorities,
who say that that is appropriate.

Indeed, if I were to take a party political position I should fervently
hope that this amendment would be carried, so that the 3.5 million
people who go greyhound racing each year could be told not to vote for
the Tories because they want to do something that will ruin their
sport. But I feel quite the opposite, and I hope that they will not. I
will not be party political, but I cannot help teasing the noble
Baroness, Lady Byford, who I like and admire, on her decision to table
the amendment. She did not mention that the briefing on this comes from
the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) and that all noble Lords have
seen it. LACS is the great campaigner for banning hunting with dogs,
which noble Lords opposite&#151;I totally agreed with
them&#151;were against. Now LACS is tally-ho against greyhound
racing, so I am a little surprised that the noble Baroness has chosen
to take up its cause, although I am delighted that we have the
opportunity to debate it today. Although I have been teasing, I believe
not only that this amendment would be bad for greyhound racing, but
that it would also be totally ineffective and could spell
death&#151;I choose my words carefully&#151;for thousands of
greyhounds.</p><p><a name="06102316000292"></a>We would not be
debating this issue today if it had not been for Seaham and the
<I>Sunday Times</I>. What happened there was disgusting&#151;I and
everyone in greyhound racing said so&#151;but a few points should be
put into proportion. The <I>Sunday Times</I> produced no evidence
whatever for its allegation that 10,000 greyhounds had been destroyed
over 15 years at Seaham. Even if there were such evidence, 15 years ago
this was normally how a dog at the end of its life was destroyed. Even
the RSPCA, we find out from local inquiries, is believed to use the
Seaham facility to get rid of surplus dogs. Things have moved on, and
it is great that they have, but we should not view the situation today
with the benefit of hindsight. What was done was not illegal and,
despite the best efforts of the press, no further Seaham has been
found.</p><p><a name="06102316000293"></a>This bears directly on
the question before us. Those few people involved at Seaham who
belonged to official greyhound racing have been fined four-figure sums
and banned for life by the NGRC. Those who mock the NGRC as rather
feeble might ponder those sentences. Indeed, if I may venture a guess,
had a statutory national authority such as the amendment calls for
imposed such sentences, they could well have been challenged in the
courts as disproportionate&#151;and perhaps successfully so. If your
house is burgled, it would not be normal to call instantly for the
abolition of the police, especially if the police later successfully
identify the culprits and punish them severely, but that is what those
who want self-regulation to be ended are effectively doing.</p><p><a name="06102316000294"></a>The LACS brief to all Peers about
progress refers to small improvements in welfare in recent years.
Having been involved in the process, I cannot agree that they are
small. Let me give three examples. The number of dogs re-homed by the
Retired Greyhound Trust has doubled in five years. There was talk of a
conflict between money and welfare but there is not one in practice
because the trust&#146;s budget has gone up six times over that
period. The NGRC is now enforcing, as it never did before, Rule 18,
tracking 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1025"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1025</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what happens to dogs on retirement and making sure that euthanasia,
which is always carried out by a licensed vet, is a last resort. Track
surface improvements that cut track injuries by 50 per cent have been
trialled at Poole. I could go on for several hours. There have been
great changes.</p><p><a name="06102316000295"></a>In one sense, the
Seaham case is an opportunity to accelerate those changes and to get on
with it. My organisation, the BGRB, has produced a radical document
called <I>Options for Change</I>, which tackles head-on the problem at
the essence of this: how to balance better the number of dogs coming
into racing with the number that can be re-homed? That is what it
mostly comes down to. We have an overall committee, which I chair, with
sub-committees&#151;the NGRC, the BGRB and the track
promoters&#151;working on the proposals that most affect them. I
cannot pre-judge the conclusions of these committees but I believe that
we will come out with a programme that will impress&#151;perhaps even
amaze&#151;our critics.</p><p><a name="06102316000296"></a>I
think that the mechanics of who regulates are less important than the
substance of the regulations. I thought the noble Baroness was a little
confused in the sense that I have no problem with saying that we should
have regulations in place by 2008&#151;we are discussing with Defra
even now what they should be&#151;but her amendment provides for a
state regulator. If we must have the argument about state regulators,
let me go through a few bullet points. It will run totally contrary, as
Defra has told us, to the Government&#146;s policy on better
regulation generally. It will create a new state bureaucracy. It will
drive greyhound racing back&#151;I warn noble Lords of this from
great knowledge&#151;to its former secretive and defensive culture,
from which I have been trying to get it to emerge. As greyhound racing
will not &#147;own&#148; externally imposed welfare initiatives, it
will resist them. In any case, the thought that some government
inspectorate will get to the bottom of what is, in essence, a cottage
industry beggars belief.</p><p><a name="06102316000297"></a>Even
if your Lordships were disposed to favour a new regulatory authority,
would it be more sensible to put it on the face of the Bill or to use
the powers in the Bill to establish it later? My view is that it would
not be sensible to put it in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102316000298"></a>First, a great deal is
going on which has a bearing on the shape of future regulation. There
is Defra&#146;s greyhound welfare working group, of which I am a
member, which includes both greyhound racing and welfarist
representatives. There is the extremely important inquiry by the
Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, chaired by Eric
Martlew MP, to whom I pay great tribute for his hard work. The inquiry
is due to report early in 2007. There is the sport&#146;s own
<I>Options for Change</I> programme, to which I have already referred.
It would surely be very odd to pre-judge that huge body of work driving
things forward by determining, as the amendment would, a remedy
now.</p><p><a name="06102316000299"></a>Secondly, there is
absolutely no agreement between the welfarists on what kind of
regulatory authority they are proposing. The LACS amendment&#151;good
luck to it&#151;wants a national regulatory authority. However, there
is a separate submission from welfare 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1026"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1026</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>members of the Greyhound Forum which advocates local authority
regulation. That, too, is the position of the Pet Advisory Committee,
to which the noble Baroness referred. To decide now, on Report in the
House, which form of statutory regulation would be right is surely not
sensible. It will require proper consideration. The Government have the
powers to impose that regulation, should they choose to do
so.</p><p><a name="06102316000300"></a>Thirdly&#151;and I speak
personally here&#151;let us think of the practical impact of the
amendment. I have described the process which the greyhound racing
industry has put in hand to tackle the problems. But suppose the House
decides today to set up a new national authority. How am I to advise
greyhound racing to proceed? To go ahead with our own programme of
reform, which will entail considerable difficulty and expense, only for
a new regulatory authority to pop up in a couple of years, no doubt to
make its mark under a chairman who wants to show that he can sort out
what I could not, and with its own programme of change? That could also
entail considerable trouble and expense, incurred by people who did not
know what they were doing.</p><p><a name="06102316000301"></a>The
amendment would not accelerate progress, which is what all of us want;
it would stall progress for two years while the great bureaucracy was
set up. If this amendment is accepted, impetus for change, which is
sweeping through greyhound racing&#151;it is about time,
too&#151;will be lost. A more sensible course, in outline, is surely
this: the Bill gives Ministers the power to move to impose regulation.
In those circumstances, let us allow the inquiries to go ahead and the
changes that I am trying to get through proceed. Then, and only then,
in a couple of years&#146; time, we can take stock and decide whether
the case for a national authority stands.</p><p><a name="06102316000302"></a>Of course, it is open to Ministers to say
at any time, not just 2008, &#147;Sorry, greyhound racing industry,
you&#146;re messing this up, we are not satisfied, and we are going
to put in a regulator&#148;. That hangs over us and will no doubt
help to concentrate some minds. But to go ahead now and set up a new
bureaucracy to do the job that we are trying very hard to do ourselves,
without giving self-regulation and the impetus behind it a chance,
would do a grave disservice to the welfare lobby and those the noble
Baroness wishes to help&#151;the greyhounds. I beg the House not to
accept the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102316000303"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06102316000787"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, whatever we do, I hope that the
Government will build in to the system a continued incentive for the
greyhound industry to improve. My favourite proposal would be to ensure
that the vets employed at courses were independent and that they were
not selected or paid by&#151;or, at least, could not have their
payment withheld by&#151;a body other than the greyhound industry
association. You need somebody in the middle of the industry who sees
what is going on and pushes continually for change. If that were done
in a reasoned way, it would provide the kind of impetus that the
greyhound industry could live with.</p><p><a name="06102316000304"></a>There are some substantial changes we
might hope for over the next 10 years. Our tracks were designed 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1027"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1027</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for much lighter animals; they are being used by big, heavy beasts which
tend to do themselves a lot of damage going round tight turns. It takes
time to sort that out; you cannot do it at a moment&#146;s notice.
Our system of racing is designed so that the favourite should not win.
In this country, favourites in greyhound racing win about one time in
three, whereas in Australia, which uses bigger tracks and different
methods, they win most of the time. People in Australia bet on first,
second and third together to make it interesting, but in England they
bet mostly on the favourite. That, too, has implications, because for
the favourite not to win, there has to be a lot of contact and
obstruction between the dogs. That will often lead to crashes and
injuries. Things need to be done over time because it would be
incredibly expensive and inconvenient, and very disruptive to the
sport, to try to do them immediately. None the less, continual
improvement is needed so that the sport is in the end run properly and
in the interests of the animals, with injuries minimised and enjoyment
maximised, rather than the present, rather unsatisfactory
situation.</p><p><a name="06102316000305"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew117"></a><a name="06102316000788"></a>Lord
Kirkhill:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. She is right to raise the
issue today. She is correct also in suggesting that this clause should
be in the Bill. Despite what the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, it is
clear that self-regulation is not working. From what I hear in the
street and among groups with which I associate, it is felt that an
audited, national regulatory authority is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06102316000306"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06102316000789"></a>Baroness
Fookes:</b> My Lords, I am minded to support my noble
friend Lady Byford, because, despite the points eloquently made by the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, I would have been more impressed had the
improvements been made several years ago and not now. It seems that
they are being made as a result of the impetus towards change that is
provided by the Animal Welfare Bill and pressure from a number of
sources. If this is not the right move, I expect the Minister to make
today a workable suggestion in lieu of my noble friend&#146;s
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102316000307"></a>Although an official
body looks at regulated tracks, I am not clear&#151;perhaps I will be
enlightened&#151;whether any of the changes and improvements to be
made through the regulatory body and self-regulation will extend to
unregulated tracks, of which I understand there are very many. I remain
extremely concerned about that. Unless the Minister comes up with a
proposal here and now which satisfies me that this matter can be dealt
with, I intend to support my noble friend Lady
Byford.</p><p><a name="06102316000308"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew119"></a><a name="06102316000790"></a>Lord
Hoyle:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on
the measures he has taken since his appointment and on the progress
made. However, I am concerned about unregulated not regulated tracks.
Would they fall into line with what is being proposed by the regulated
tracks, particularly on the attendance of veterinary surgeons? We know
that this is the difficult side of the sport. One wants to see the
sport continue.

to see a lot more of them re-housed. However, I am extremely concerned
about tracks that will go their own way&#151;I do not think that the
Minister will be able to speak about them today. I serve on the
committee chaired by Eric Martlew, and we will bring forward our
proposals, but we should do all we can to protect the welfare of the
animals. As far as I can see, this amendment can only strengthen the
industry. I hope that the Minister will tell us what effect the changes
will have on unregulated tracks, which are of great concern to us
all.</p><p><a name="06102316000309"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew120"></a><a name="06102316000791"></a>The
Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, I believe that a very
large percentage of greyhounds are bred in Ireland&#151;and I am sure
that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, will nod and say whether that is
right. How would our regulation overlap in that sense? It is obviously
a problem, when one is being asked to judge whether we should do this
by self-regulation and ensure that the self-regulation is properly done
or by government regulation. I am always inclined to go for
self-regulation, but I am open to persuasion either
way.</p><p><a name="06102316000310"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="06102316000792"></a>Lord
Kimball:</b> My Lords, I am particularly interested
in subsection (2)(c) of my noble friend&#146;s amendment, on
the,</p><ul><a name="06102316000644"></a>&#147;identification
of greyhounds employed for racing purposes&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102316000311"></a>One reason why I was eased out from
running the Greyhound Racing Fund was that I wanted to be absolutely
certain that the dogs could be properly identified. At the moment, dogs
are identified only by an earmarking scheme. I see from the
fund&#146;s annual report that the amount of money spent on the
earmarking scheme over the past 10 years has hardly varied. It is not a
very satisfactory situation putting a mark in a dog&#146;s ear. It is
very easy to adjust it at certain times. The proper way to do it would
have been to chip all the greyhounds. When a greyhound goes to race it
is weighed immediately as it has to come within a certain weight limit,
so it would be perfectly possible to put something that could read its
chip above the place where it is weighed. That could be done at the
same time. It is very interesting that all dogs from Battersea Dogs
&amp; Cats Home are chipped, and I do not believe that those chips can
have done anything but good, as they enable dogs to be properly
identified. We must make a move in that
direction.</p><p><a name="06102316000312"></a>I turn to the other
interesting thing about the amendment. If you look at the things on
which the Greyhound Racing Board spends money, you can see that it is
doing absolutely everything that the amendment asks for, including drug
testing. Every dog is tested for drugs before it goes onto the track,
so that is already there. All the veterinary surgeons are independent
and attend the meetings. The licensing of kennels is very difficult to
enforce, but the other real problem is the maintenance of tracks. In
Ireland, there was a big programme to get all the tracks up to a
certain standard. In this country, the existing 30 tracks have a very
restricted standard. Then there are the 17 flapping tracks. What are we
going to do about the tracks in Wisbech and other places that do not
come under the National Greyhound Racing Club?</p>

desirable, a great deal of the work is already being done, and I would

Lipsey:</b> My Lords, I should like to set the noble
Lord&#146;s mind at rest on the matter of independent tracks. They
will be covered by regulation under the Bill. My own strong belief is
that within two or three years, the remaining dying tracks will either
have gone or one or two of them will have joined the
NGRC.</p><p><a name="06102316000315"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew123"></a><a name="06102316000794"></a>Lord
Bilston:</b> My Lords, I should like to make a couple
of comments on what is a very important issue. I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Byford, on raising the issue. The welfare issues for
greyhounds are of great concern to people involved in greyhound racing.
I can declare that I have owned greyhounds for more than 40 years and
am a former chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Greyhound Group. I
have had great involvement with greyhounds over many years. I pay
special tribute to my noble friend Lord Lipsey for the stewardship and
leadership he has provided over the past three years in his capacity as
chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board. He has done an
excellent job.</p><p><a name="06102316000316"></a>In essence what
we are doing today is taking stock. I say on behalf of the greyhound
group that we constantly monitor, observe and comment on issues
affecting our national greyhound sport. I assure your Lordships that
all the members of that group are happy and satisfied. We recognise
that there are many issues, which have been raised today, that still
need to be addressed&#151;but they are being addressed. Progress is
being made in every aspect, as was evidenced by the noble Lord who
spoke just before me about what is being achieved.</p><p><a name="06102316000317"></a>At this stage, I urge
the House to recognise and value what progress has been made. Outside
the isolated incident that took place in County Durham, which we all
abhor and find totally disgusting, good progress is being made on the
welfare of greyhounds. There is greater care by the owners of
greyhounds, and the Retired Greyhound Trust is re-homing many more
greyhounds. I assure your Lordships that in every registered greyhound
stadium there is a greater awareness of, and interest in, the welfare
of greyhounds and their re-homing after they have retired than I have
ever known in the time I have been involved in greyhound racing. As
your Lordships know, the sport gives a great deal of pleasure to many
thousands of people, but at the base of it we need to make sure, as
noble Lords have said today, that our greyhounds are happy and well
treated and that, at the end of their racing life, they have a proper
retirement and a proper home.</p><p><a name="06102316000318"></a>I
hope that we will allow my noble friend Lord Lipsey and his board,
along with the National Greyhound Racing Club, to continue to do the
work they are doing. If, as has been said, the Minister here or
Ministers in the other place feel that there is a need for certain
tightening up, I hope they will bring forward that kind of measure at
the appropriate time.

things are not in any way as bad as they have been portrayed in that
dreadful case recently, and that we have good reason to be thankful
that progress is being made. I hope that your Lordships will all, at
some stage in the next few months, go and take part in a lovely night
out in greyhound racing, and see how well the animals are looked after.
If I am there and I can find you a winner, I will do my very best to
oblige.

Falkland:</b> My Lords, we have heard of the good
will of the noble Lord and all those involved with greyhound racing,
along with their aspirations for the welfare of greyhounds, but neither
he nor the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, have said anything to us about the
scale of what we are looking at.</p><p><a name="06102316000320"></a>The article in the <I>Sunday Times</I>
drew to our attention the scale of redundant superfluous greyhounds.
Unlike race horses, dogs have litters, which adds to the problem. It
seems to me that the public are alerted to the fact that large numbers
of dogs are bred uniquely for racing and that those that do not reach
the appropriate standard will become redundant. The intention is to
rehome them. Some people take them and they often make good pets, but
the sheer number of dogs is huge. That has not yet been mentioned.
There is no way in which any body, no matter how well disposed, will
farm out the number of dogs which are no longer valuable as racing
animals. A balance needs to be drawn here, as in everything. These dogs
are bred to race. People gamble on those races. The same applies to
horse racing. We have to accept that animals which no longer race and
cannot be found homes will be destroyed. That is unacceptable to many
people. We have to find a balance. I do not take a moral view on the
issue. Nobody is suggesting that we should consider banning dog racing
because of the horror of all these animals having to be destroyed
because they are no longer of any use&#151;far from
it.</p><p><a name="06102316000321"></a>What we have to decide today
is whether the way of dealing with the matter suggested by the noble
Lord, Lord Lipsey, or that of the noble Baroness is right. I tend to go
towards that suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, because I
believe that it would be less bureaucratic, but can his method deal
with unlicensed tracks, as many noble Lords have said? Like other noble
Lords, I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on this.
What he says will determine the way in which I shall vote, if there
should be a
vote.</p><p><a name="06102316000322"></a><b><a name="61023-0006.htm_spnew125"></a><a name="06102316000796"></a>Baroness

grateful to her for doing that and enabling this debate to take place,
which has brought out serious welfare issues and has enabled us to hear
from people who know a lot about the industry. I was interested to hear
my noble friend Lord Falkland refer to certain parallels that the
debate brought out for him.</p>

Lord, Lord Lipsey, with regard to the issues mentioned in this debate
and our debates on hunting. As regards wastage of dogs, what happens to
hounds when they have finished drag hunting? Your Lordships debated at
length what happened at the end of hounds&#146; working lives. No
doubt the same issues that we have debated apply in that case. My noble
friend said that horse racing does not have to deal with certain issues
because race horses do not breed to the same extent as dogs. We have to
decide whether we should include this new clause in the Bill or whether
we regard the Bill as being adequate to address greyhound racing and
other animal issues.</p><p><a name="06102316000324"></a>I
understand the frustration that it may take slightly longer to go down
the route proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, but I am sure that
the noble Baroness is not promoting regulation in the Bill for every
industry involving animals and entertainment. We are trying to draw up
a broad framework. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will draw up a
broad framework which encompasses not only greyhound racing but all
those other sports that involve animals on which betting takes
place.</p><p><a name="06102316000325"></a><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06102316000797"></a>Lord
Christopher:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Byford, on tabling the amendment, and I apologise to
her, because it was my intention to add my name to it and I completely
overlooked doing so. I find myself very much in the same situation as
the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes. I would be more impressed with
self-regulation if we had seen it working; whereas demonstrably it has
not been working. My noble friend refers to an isolated incident, but
rather like the pheasants that the noble Earl referred to, we simply do
not know whether it was an isolated incident. Indeed, there was a
further report, about which I have read nothing since, of a not
dissimilar case somewhere up in the north-west. There may well be
others, and the untraceable gap between the numbers of greyhounds that
are used for racing and what happens at the end of the day is not
capable of explanation. If I share anything with the noble Baroness,
Lady Byford, on this, it is simply that we should have some data on
what is happening.</p><p><a name="06102316000326"></a>I looked back
quite a long time, but I cannot recall any occasion when any
profession, industry or trade has been facing the possibility of
statutory regulation as against self-regulation when it has not
protested as volubly as it possibly could. My noble friend Lord Lipsey
certainly did that this afternoon. But it seems to me that what will
have to be done in this area at the end of the day will be so costly
that there is no real chance of the greyhound industry finding the
money to do it. There will be slippage, and there will be poor quality.
Something of the sort will happen. I accept what my noble friend said
about this boiling down to the point that the noble Viscount on the
Liberal Benches made about supply and demand in terms of the number of
greyhounds required for racing. That may well be insoluble as far as it
goes, but if that is what people do we should be saying to them that
they must face up to the economic consequences.</p>

British public opinion that thousands of dogs annually are simply put
down. If the <I>Sunday Times</I> article achieved anything at all,
apart perhaps from alerting us, it is that public opinion will now
expect this House and the one down the road to say clearly that
something is going to happen about this. The public will not understand
all the complexities of secondary legislation or anything else. That is
not what they will understand. They will want to see that we are doing
something positive. This amendment does that. I hope that whatever the
noble Baroness decides to do this afternoon she will not let this go at
the final
stage.</p><p><a name="06102316000328"></a><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06102316000798"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, we have had a fascinating
debate with 12 speakers. This is another issue&#151;and I do not say
this lightly&#151;on which progress has been made. There was no
commitment originally in the Bill, but there is a commitment now, which
I shall come to in some detail.</p><p><a name="06102316000329"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked me
five specific questions about how the system would work on random
inspections, drug testing, audit of enforcement, openness and
transparency and quality assurance and inspection. The answer to all
five is &#147;Yes&#148;. Obviously, we have to look at the
relationship between regulations and codes, so that we can address the
issues through whatever the best route is. But whatever route is
chosen, the answer to those five points is &#147;Yes&#148;. The
industry has to get its act in order; like a lot of others, by the way.
I do not know the full history of all this. The <I>Sunday Times</I>
piece was important, but in terms of the time span and what has
happened in the past, as the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, said,
clearly something does not add up with the numbers. There is no doubt
about that. Therefore, it is the last chance for the industry to get
its act together. Self-regulation is a preferable route in many areas,
because it is quicker than the statutory route, but in this case, this
is the last chance and the Bill gives us the facility to take action.
The public are rightly concerned about this issue in light of the press
stories in the
summer.</p><p><a name="06102316000330"></a>The
regulated sector is making advances in welfare. My noble friend Lord
Lipsey has highlighted the action taken by the National Greyhound
Racing Club against trainers known to have used the yard at Seaham to
dispose of unwanted greyhounds. I reiterate that there is little
reliable, statistical evidence of systematic mistreatment of greyhounds
on retirement. It is true that the figures do not add up in terms of
the numbers retiring and what allegedly happens to them, but we do not
have facts that would be reliable evidence. However, the industry
should be doing a lot more to ensure that comprehensive records are
maintained. The industry must be accountable for what happens to these
dogs and there must be a better system for identifying dogs. The lack
of comprehensive accurate records kept by the industry is bound to make
people suspicious and not trust it&#151;and rightly so. It is the
industry&#146;s problem and the onus is on it.</p>



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1033"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1033</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102316000331"></a>We are still keen for self-regulation, but
only if all concerned can be satisfied that open and auditable
self-regulation is possible. This the last chance; there must be
self-regulation under the circumstances I have described, otherwise a
statutory route will be taken. More needs to be done and I understand
that the NGRC is having discussions with the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service concerning the way its activities should be
evaluated.</p><p><a name="06102316000332"></a>I plead guilty to
not having been greyhound racing since I was probably too young to
go&#151;maybe eight or nine years old, when I was taken by my father,
who was selling newspapers from a stall at Perry Barr greyhound
stadium. I am sure that I went under a barrier. However, we at Defra
believe that the NGRC has an image problem. I do not know why it is
called a club; that gives the wrong impression. It suggests a closed
shop, a private members&#146; club where no one is admitted unless
they are a member. That does not give a good impression. It suggests
some kind of exclusive closed shop and is not the sort of image that we
or Parliament would want from a body responsible for winning the hearts
and minds of those who do not consider the NGRC to be a suitable
welfare regulator. We start from the premise that it has not been
suitable and we want to give it a chance to become suitable. The public
does not trust it and the body has one last chance&#151;it has been
seen to be making a move and that is
important.</p><p><a name="06102316000333"></a>It is also evident
that the British Greyhound Racing Board needs to look carefully at
marshalling its resources to boost the funding it has already allocated
to deal with welfare matters. We are fully aware that many welfare
groups are very sceptical that the NGRC can ever be a fully effective
regulator. I have been on the receiving end, as have noble colleagues,
of representations from the third sector&#151;welfare
groups.</p><p><a name="06102316000334"></a>Defra&#146;s
greyhound welfare working group has achieved much in opening up a
dialogue between the racing industry and welfare organisations. We must
acknowledge that much remains to be sorted out. The industry and
welfare organisations were able to work successfully together in
drawing up a greyhound charter and, with give and take on both sides,
there is no reason why we cannot produce regulations and a code of
practice that is broadly acceptable; but it must fill proper
criteria.</p><p><a name="06102316000335"></a>The Associate
Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare has also set up an inquiry into
the welfare implications of greyhound racing. We welcome that
initiative. The inquiry will report in April next year and we shall
consider its recommendations and how they fit in with what we believe
can be achieved.</p><p><a name="06102316000336"></a>The amendment
seeks to force the Government into introducing a licensing scheme
within two years of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. However, it would
have the effect of ensuring that any provision on greyhounds that had
not been made within two years of Royal Assent could not be made at
all. I am not praying in aid a technical defect, because we could put
that right at Third Reading. If we are going to legislate, however, we
have to do it with precision and not look as though we did not
understand the full

Government into an unprecedented situation of being required to produce
regulations by a certain deadline, without any obvious sanction if we
failed to do so. That would be a problem, as we could lose our power to
regulate greyhounds&#151;that would be the consequence of the
amendment as it is. I am not resting my case on that; I am just
pointing it out in case there is a desire to come back on the issue at
Third Reading, as noble colleagues are fully entitled to
do.</p><h5><a name="06102316000662"></a>5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102316000337"></a>Concerns
over the timetable for introducing regulations on greyhounds have been
expressed by many Members. If the noble Baroness will withdraw her
amendment&#151;notwithstanding the fact that she could come back with
something&#151;I will commit on behalf of the Government and Ben
Bradshaw, the Minister with day-to-day responsibility for these
matters, to bringing forward regulations and a code to ensure standards
at greyhound racing, to be introduced by the end of 2008 and to come
into force by April 2009.</p><p><a name="06102316000338"></a>I repeat this, because
it has to be the case. We cannot do everything at once. The resources
are not there in the department. We have had to set priorities on how
we bring the various parts of the legislation into force. Indeed, in
some areas, we have not yet made commitments or have said that we will
introduce codes and regulations as soon as possible. In other areas, we
have been able to make commitments and bring them forward earlier than
we originally promised. This is an area that was not on the radar, but,
as I said, we will get something into force by April 2009 and provide a
commitment that any proposals will involve regulation backed up by a
code of practice.</p><p><a name="06102316000339"></a>This is the
last chance. If the industry wants statutory regulation&#151;so that,
in effect, it is taken out of the hands of the people who are doing it
now&#151;it should do nothing, in which case it will succeed. I wish
the industry well&#151;and I wish my noble friend well&#151;but it
has some serious image problems, which we must make abundantly clear to
it. Parliament requires action. If the action is not there, Parliament
will take the
action.</p><p><a name="06102316000340"></a><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06102316000799"></a>Baroness

that the industry has the wrong impression and that there is a lot to

important points have been made. Before I decide what I will do, let me
just thank everyone who has
contributed.</p><p><a name="06102316000341"></a>I am well aware of

how we do it. I make those general points now and will come back to the

does not propose a ban in any way or form on greyhound racing. In fact,
I hope that, even if the amendment has to be redone, it would give
greater strength to the industry and make it go forward, so I thought
it a little surprising, and a little unlike him, that the noble Lord
decided to take that route.</p><p><a name="06102316000343"></a>It
was not me who raised this issue&#151;my amendment followed on from
the <I>Sunday Times </I>article&#151;but the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey,
will know very well that I wound up in a debate on greyhound welfare
three or four years ago, so he cannot say that I am a latecomer to this
business. I have been taking a very great interest in it for some
time.</p><p><a name="06102316000344"></a>I accept that the industry
has made some improvements. I said that earlier and I complimented the
noble Lord on what it had done, but it is too little and too late. I
should have liked the industry to have moved further forward. However,
that is for another day.</p><p><a name="06102316000345"></a>I shall
not repeat the comments of my noble friends Lord Lucas, Lady Fookes and
Lord Onslow or the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, because I think that they
were basically in favour of what I am trying to do in achieving better
welfare. Therefore, I excuse myself from picking up on their comments.
The noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, raised the question of unregulated
tracks&#151;a point that I brought up in Committee. This is an
enormous problem. Although the regulated industry says that it can
cope, I am not convinced that it can; nor has it told us what action it
will take. If the owners of unregulated tracks wish to continue to run
greyhound racing in their own way, there is nothing at present to bring
them back into the fold. So I am still very concerned about
that.</p><p><a name="06102316000346"></a>My noble friend Lord
Kimball may be slightly more in favour of the status quo. His
background knowledge is much greater than mine and I can understand his
view, but I hope he will accept that I have grave concerns that the
industry may not have moved far enough. However, he raised the very
important question of identification&#151;a matter that we have
mentioned during different debates on farming and agriculture. I refer,
in particular, to identification tags on the ears of sheep and cattle,
which get ripped out, and microchipping might be one way of overcoming
that problem.</p><p><a name="06102316000347"></a>I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Bilston, whom I also thank for his contribution, is
slightly happier and more satisfied than I am with the current standing
of the regulatory board. He acknowledged that there are many issues to
be addressed. At this stage, there are sufficient to make me unsure
that the board will achieve what I know some of its members wish to do.
It is not that they do not know what they wish to do.
</p><p><a name="06102316000348"></a>I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Christopher. If I table another amendment on this issue,
perhaps he will add his name to it. He raised the very important issue
of the problems caused by lack of data, which it would be an enormous
help to have. I

contributions.</p><p><a name="06102316000349"></a>I
return to what the Minister said and the offer that he made. He said,
as I and others have done, that at present the industry should be doing
more. We all agree with that. The question is: how do we go about it?
What do we do with the industry members that are not regulated? I am
well aware of the work that is being done by the other groups and I do
not wish to take issue with that. I am also aware that the Minister has
been persuaded to give the welfare of greyhounds a higher priority. We
have met him and his officials outside the Chamber and I accept what he
said about the difficulties that have to be faced: there will be much
work to be done on the Bill; a lot of codes of practice and regulations
will be required; and there are timetabling pressured in that regard,
let alone financial pressures. I am grateful to him and his colleagues
for recognising that the welfare concerns relating to the greyhound
industry should have been brought higher up the pecking order. That is
an enormous help.</p><p><a name="06102316000350"></a>I ask myself
where that leaves me. I am grateful for, and encouraged by, the
comments that have been made by noble Lords on all sides. I should like
to look at <I>Hansard</I> very carefully when it is printed tomorrow to
see whether there are issues that the Minister and I will have a chance
to talk about to see whether we can do something before Third Reading,
which is due to take place a week on Wednesday. I do not wish to be
disruptive but it is an issue that has taken a long time to be
addressed, and it has still not been fully and properly addressed. This
is the time to say that the issue should be taken into consideration,
before the Bill do pass.</p><p><a name="06102316000351"></a><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06102316000800"></a>Lord

insert the following new clause-</ul><ul><a name="06102316000544"></a>&#147;PET FAIRS</ul><ul><a name="06102316000545"></a>(1) A person commits an offence if
he-</ul> (a) sells an animal in the course of or in
connection with a pet fair, (b) arranges a

making, or carrying out, arrangements for a pet fair.

not include a non-commercial exchange of animals.</ul><ul><a name="06102316000548"></a>(4) In this section, &#147;pet

business that consists wholly or mainly for the keeping or selling of
animals at premises ordinarily occupied for the purposes of that
business.</ul><ul><a name="06102316000549"></a>(5) For the
purposes of this section-</ul> (a)
&#147;selling&#148; an animal includes-
(i) offering or exposing it for sale,
(ii) exchanging it, or offering or exposing it for
exchange, (iii) transferring, or agreeing

noble Baroness said: My Lords, we move on to pet fairs. I tabled the
amendment partly to say that, following the Defra announcement, I
commend the Minister on the decision to ban the commercial sale of
animals at pet fairs. This is an important step that will contribute
greatly to animal welfare.</p><p><a name="06102316000360"></a>I
also tabled the amendment to be able to ask the Minister a few details
about the implementation of the promised regulations. First, is it the
Government&#146;s plan to institute the ban according to the
timetable that he shared with us for secondary legislation? In other
words, can we count on it being enforced by 2008? Secondly, will the
Minister still produce by that date regulations and codes of practice
for pet fairs without commercial sales or for fairs that involve
poultry, carp and pigeons?</p><p><a name="06102316000361"></a>Finally, will the Minister say a little
more about the definition that his department will put on the word
&#147;commercial&#148;? It will certainly be a matter for
consultation. I appreciate that because it is important to get the
balance right in prohibiting events where conditions are bad and sales
are for profit&#151;the sort of fairs that the Government have it in
mind to ban. But what about the genuine hobbyist events that are
community events and that we on these Benches and the Government are
very anxious to see continue? They should not be brought into the
commercial sector in any way. In discussions which I have had with
animal hobbyists it has been suggested that
&#147;non-commercial&#148; can include, for example, the

continues to be wide, and the exchange of best practice. Those are
genuine non-commercial activities. Questions arise whether they will be
members-only events and how to ensure that the exchanges are between
those who are genuinely concerned primarily for the animals and their
hobby and not about profit.</p><p><a name="06102316000362"></a>Once
again I congratulate the Government on bringing forward such a definite
step on pet fairs. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answer, and
beg to

Duke of Montrose:</b> My Lords, we are glad to see
that the noble Baroness has tabled this amendment. It is a beefed-out
version of the amendment we tabled in Committee. Again, as the noble
Baroness has pointed out, things have changed. The Government announced
on 10 October that they have proposals for new measures; I am little
surprised that they have not given us an amendment of their own.
Perhaps the Minister can explain why it has not been appropriate for
the Government to table an amendment at this time.</p><p><a name="06102316000364"></a>The Government&#146;s proposals are in
a similar vein to some of the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady
Miller. It would be helpful to the House if they could clarify what was
meant by the description of,</p><ul><a name="06102316000645"></a>&#147;pet fairs that do not involve
the sale of animals, or that do involve the sale of animals but not in
the course of a
business&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000504"></a>We shall
listen to the Minister&#146;s response. At present, however, I would
support the noble Baroness. <h5><a name="06102316000663"></a>6

noble Baroness asked for regarding the dates without
reservation&#151;if I am wrong, I will no doubt be told while I am on
my feet. Our commitment is certainly by 2008, which is what she asked
for. It has changed. There has been sustained parliamentary pressure on
this issue. As I shall mention, there has been an intervention from the
courts and we must take account of
that.</p><p><a name="06102316000366"></a>As has just been
mentioned, on 10 October we made an announcement in the other place on
our proposals on the regulation of pet fairs. As with all secondary
legislation under the Bill, the proposals are still being formulated
and must be fully consulted upon in due course. We now propose to
prohibit the sale of animals to members of the public where this is
part of a business at pet fairs. However, we also propose to make
exceptions to this prohibition in the case of koi carp shows, racing
pigeon sales and poultry sales. We propose that these types of events
could be licensed by local authorities under regulations to be made
under the Animal Welfare
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102316000367"></a>We propose to clarify in
secondary legislation that those events where there is either no
selling of pet animals to members of the public, or where there is
selling of pet animals but not in the course of a business&#151;such
as hobbyists selling excess stock&#151;can continue to take place
without a requirement to be licensed. All events where there are
animals present will be subject to the welfare offence whether or not
they are specifically regulated by the local authority.</p>

their original proposal to regulate the commercial selling of animals
at pet fairs following a judgment made in the High Court on
14 June. The judgment was in relation to a judicial review in the case
of Haynes v Stafford Borough Council about the issuing of a licence
under the Pet Animals Act 1951 to the organisers of a pet
fair. One of the findings of the judicial review was that local
authorities could not issue licences under the 1951 Act to organisers
of pet fairs where these events fell within the activity described in
Section 2 of the 1951 Act and involved the sale of animals, as part of
a business, to members of the
public.</p><p><a name="06102316000369"></a>The best place to deal
with the regulations and prohibitions on the selling of pet animals is
in secondary legislation. The alternative&#151;placing such
restrictions in the Bill&#151;would be likely to lead to the sort of
difficulties experienced under the Pet Animals Act 1951 that resulted,
with its associated amendments, in the judicial
review.</p><p><a name="06102316000370"></a>This amendment contains
a definition of a pet fair, and we would welcome the opportunity to
look at this more closely when drafting the regulations. If the other
question of whether there is a definition of commercialism needs to be
looked at, the place to do so is in regulations. There will plenty of
opportunity for this and, of course, full consultation on the relevant
amendments. I hope that will satisfy the noble
Baroness.</p><p><a name="06102316000371"></a><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06102316000807"></a>Baroness

noble Baroness said: My Lords, I now turn to a group of amendments that
includes a number of government amendments, but is headed by our
Amendment No. 14 which requires that regulations promoting the welfare
of animals under subsection (1) may be made only if the appropriate
national authority is satisfied on the basis of scientific evidence in
the public domain that those regulations are necessary to promote
welfare.</p><p><a name="06102316000376"></a>During
the passage of the Bill, we have had long discussions about what may be
in the codes. On some issues, we feel very strongly that the codes
should be based on scientific evidence. This cluster of amendments
addresses the current strategy for making regulations and codes of
practice. Amendment No. 14 ensures that regulations promoting animal
welfare are based on scientific evidence. The amendment includes a
provision, similar to that in Clause 1(4), that regulations and changes
to regulations should be made only when the appropriate national
authority,</p><ul><a name="06102316000646"></a>&#147;is
satisfied, on the basis of scientific
evidence&#148;</ul><a name="06102316000505"></a>that they
can be justified.

under the Bill and the evidence on which the appropriate national
authority relies should be open and transparent. It is not enough for a
national authority simply to state that it is satisfied that the
evidence supports its actions without making that evidence available.
Although Ministers give assurances that they or this Government will
not abuse the powers given under this legislation, it has to stand the
test of time. If it is 95 years before we have new legislation, we must
be sure that this version is robust. So far, the Government have
resisted amendments to rectify these defects without providing a
suitable explanation for why they oppose them. The parameters for
regulations in the Bill are important because it is an enabling Bill.
We describe it as a skeleton Bill because most of the work is done in
regulations and codes.</p><p><a name="06102316000378"></a>That
brings me to Amendments Nos. 19, 20, 21, 49 and 50. They ensure that
codes of practice are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure
in both Houses. I know that the Minister is always careful to make sure
that codes are relevant, but, with his many years of experience in the
other place, he knows that we can talk on them, but cannot alter them.
That is why we are encouraging the Government to accept using the
affirmative resolution procedure. I thank the Clerks who advised me on
this matter and said that while famous codes of practice, such as
admissions codes for education, are subject to the negative resolution
procedure, there is nothing to prevent the affirmative resolution
procedure applying to new codes of practice. When he responds, I hope
the Minister will clarify that for
me.</p><p><a name="06102316000379"></a>This is an extremely
important point, and I was disappointed to see from the timetable the
priority that the codes have. Since then, I have been grateful to the
Minister for acknowledging that they should have been higher up the
list, particularly the code on greyhounds. Some 22 sets of regulations
are set to arrive in the next four years, and I hope this debate will
stimulate some of the decisions about when they will be
enacted.</p><p><a name="06102316000380"></a>I return to Amendment
No. 14, on which I have support from the Countryside Alliance and the
National Farmers&#146; Union. In the latter's submission to me, it
states that regulations should be made only if Ministers are satisfied
that there is scientific evidence. The submission
states:</p><ul><a name="06102316000552"></a>&#147;Indeed, in his
letter of May 15 to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee, Lord Rooker refers to these order-making powers as a
fundamental element in the legislation to enable the law to be
developed &#145;to reflect changing animal welfare practices and
emerging scientific evidence&#146; Without such a safeguard what is
to prevent the introduction of regulations which are very demanding or
restrictive on the owners of animals promoted by an emotional campaign
... for which there is scant scientific or veterinary
justification?&#148;</ul><a name="06102316000506"></a>That
is an important point for us to
consider.<p><a name="06102316000381"></a>I look forward to

Rooker:</b> My Lords, there is a strong case for
considering the point just made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller,
that we should be a proper revising Chamber, rather than what I think
we are&#151;more of a repetition Chamber presented with a <I>fait
accompli</I>: we either vote down an order or accept it; and I do not
remember the last time that the House voted down an order. There is a
strong case for considering the powers of what would be a revising
Chamber, but that is a matter for another day. I am sure that powers
and competencies of a second Chamber will be widely debated in
future.</p><p><a name="06102316000384"></a>On
Amendment No. 14, which was tabled in Grand Committee as part of a
large group, we do not think it necessary to legislate in that way for
something that we think should take place in practice anyway. The
Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales would always
take existing scientific evidence into account when framing
regulations, in line with best practice in policy-making. In addition,
the Government intend to make regulations only to the extent to which
they are necessary to promote the welfare of animals for which a person
is responsible.</p><p><a name="06102316000385"></a>Emphasising the
use of scientific evidence risks excluding some other important factors
that should be taken into account when considering whether to
legislate, such as social and economic consequences. One must consider
the matter in the round. In answer to the latter point made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Byford, we are committed to evidence-based
policy-making. Where there is overwhelming public concern about a
particular issue, the evidential base may take account of the views of
the public as well as any available scientific studies. The two
examples of which I am reminded are the banning of veal crates and sow
stalls, where you could argue whether the science was in favour of a
change but the overwhelming public concern, the economic and social
aspects, gave weight to the need to regulate, as we did. That must not
be ruled out. In other words, looking at the science is not the be-all
and end-all; there are other factors to be taken into
account.</p><h5><a name="06102316000664"></a>6.15

Nos. 19 to 21 would require codes of practice made under the Bill to be
exercisable by statutory instrument and thereby approved by the
affirmative procedure. Clause 59 makes it clear that the powers in the
Bill to make orders or regulations are exercised by statutory
instrument, which has the effect of applying the provisions of the
Statutory Instruments Act 1946. Subsection (2) further requires that
any regulations to extend the definition of an animal, to exempt
mutilations, to promote welfare or to introduce licensing or
registration schemes would have to be approved by the affirmative
procedure described in the subsection. I should point out, however,
that codes of practice are not legislation and cannot therefore be
statutory instruments according to the meaning that the Statutory
Instruments Act 1946 gives to
them.</p><p><a name="06102316000389"></a>The
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee also considered the
negative procedure sufficient for its report on the Bill. In the past
five years, the House has always accepted the recommendations of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. There was one
exception&#151;I do not remember what it was and I do not recall
whether I was at the Home Office or the ODPM at the time&#151;where
the House decided to go further. It was very unusual, however. By and
large, the House accepts the committee&#146;s recommendations. I
therefore hope that the government amendments are accepted, and that my
answer to Amendment No. 14 in particular is
acceptable.</p><p><a name="06102316000390"></a><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew140"></a><a name="06102316000811"></a>Baroness

for explaining his amendments. We are very pleased to support them, and
to support Amendments Nos. 15 and 25 in particular, which put a duty on
the national authority to consult. The Minister asked when any
regulation had been rejected. I believe that the House voted against
one on supplementary medicine. It went to another place and our vote
was overturned straight away. I accept what the Minister said about any
future discussions on the powers of this House, but it would make an
enormous difference if we could have a greater say in
this.</p><p><a name="06102316000391"></a>The
Minister says that any judgment would be based on scientific evidence.
I am happy to have that on the record. I do not doubt it for a minute.
My amendment was not trying to suggest that it should be considered
only for that reason. That was not its intention. This shows how
carefully one must choose the right words to ensure that one&#146;s
amendments fit what one is trying to do. I thank the Minister for his
response, and I beg leave to withdraw the

noble Lord said: My Lords, this group contains exclusively government
amendments which respond to concerns expressed in both Houses about the
absence of effective safeguards on the exercise of some powers in the
Bill.  I informed the Grand Committee that we had taken on board
some of the concerns already expressed in another place on this point
and were still considering how best to respond to them.  I trust
that noble Lords will agree that this group of amendments achieves the
correct
balance.</p><p><a name="06102316000409"></a>Amendment
No. 30 isparticularly important.  This new clause will
ensure that an owner has a right of appeal where a court makes
an order under Clause 20(1) or refuses to do so at the
owner&#146;s application.  As noble Lords will be aware,
legitimate concerns have been expressed about the possible
exercise of 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1044"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1044</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clause 20 powers in the absence of a prosecution.  While I think
we are all agreed that it is important to be able to dispose of animals
even though a prosecution may not have been brought, we have sympathy
with the concern that there should be sufficient safeguards of the
rights of owners when this power is exercised.  Amendment No. 30
will ensure this.</p><p><a name="06102316000410"></a>This
right of appeal to the Crown Court enables the matter to be heard all
over again and a different order can be made if the Crown Court thinks
fit. We have given this right to only the owner of the animals
concerned and not to other interested parties who might be involved in
the application under Clause 20, such as the State Veterinary Service,
the police or RSPCA. We consider that the owner has the main interest
in the animal, whether financial or otherwise, which needs protection.
Other parties, while concerned for the welfare of the animal, do not
have the same type of interest in it.</p><p><a name="06102316000411"></a>If the court has erred
in law when it makes an order under Clause 20, there are other avenues
of appeal, in the form of case stated to the High Court or judicial
review, which are open to all. But we want to balance the need to
protect the owners&#146; interests with the need to avoid lengthy and
potentially expensive appeals in every case where there is an order
under Clause 20. Ultimately, if the court makes a wrong decision and
returns an animal to its owner, it is always possible to act again
under the power in Clause 18 if it proves that the animal is suffering
or at risk of suffering as a result. I hope it is accepted that we have
the right balance here.</p><p><a name="06102316000412"></a>Amendments Nos. 26 and
29 introduce rights of appeal against orders for the reimbursement of
certain expenses. I will go into detail if noble Lords desire it, but I
should at least mention each government amendment. Amendments Nos. 27
and 28 ensure that a court can make any of the orders in Clause 20(1),
not just the one applied for; for example, an inspector may apply for
sale of the animal, and the court may want to order that the animal be
given back to the owner.  Amendments Nos. 31 to 39 are matters
of drafting.</p><p><a name="06102316000413"></a>Amendment No. 29
removes the reference to an application &#147;by way of
complaint&#148; in Clause 20 because we do not think that that is the
right process in every case. It can still be used in some cases, but in
others there may be several interested parties who need to give
evidence so that the court can reach the right decision based on all
the facts. Therefore, we think that the right approach is for rules of
court to be made under the powers in the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act
1980 to ensure that the court gives notice and an opportunity to be
heard to every interested party when it hears an application under
Clause 20. Exactly who is an interested party will obviously vary from
one case to another, and the court hearing the application will be best
placed to consider who to include. If that involves a delay, directions
can be made to ensure the welfare of the animal in the mean time. I beg
to move.</p><p><a name="06102316000414"></a><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06102316000817"></a>The

noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is a fairly small issue which has
been raised with us by the International League for the Protection of
Horses. The amendment seeks to build on the new and improved provisions
of owner disqualification through the courts. It would add to the list
of activities currently within Clause 33(2) and seeks to correct a
loophole that would allow disqualified persons to drive or ride
animals&#151;in particular, the league is thinking of horses,
naturally. The amendment would ensure that when making an order the
court could disqualify a person from riding or driving an animal whilst
disqualified. In practice, this could prevent the original owner
entering into an arrangement with a supposedly new owner, or hiring a
horse out, say, from a riding station, and continuing his contact with
the animal.</p><p><a name="06102316000428"></a>I understand that
the International League for the Protection of Horses has already
persuaded the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs
Department (SEERAD) to add the amendment to the Animal Health and
Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. I hope that under those circumstances the
Minister will feel able to accept this small amendment, which could
correct this oversight. I beg to

the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 34 would enable the court to
impose further restrictions under the terms of a disqualification
order. Accepting the amendment would result in a court being able to
disqualify a person convicted of a relevant offence from being in
control&#151;albeit only temporarily&#151;of an animal owned or
kept by someone else by riding, driving or using it. The expression
&#147;using an animal&#148; is a broad one and would give the court

Rooker:</b> The noble Baroness is quite right, my
Lords. The amendment does refer to &#147;riding or driving&#148;.
It is not the first time today that I have found an old set of notes in
front of me. The last paragraph I read out is inoperative&#151;I
think that that is the
language.</p><p><a name="06102316000434"></a>I
should like to talk about the intentions behind the amendment,
notwithstanding what the noble Baroness has just said. We do not think
it would enhance the powers that we propose to make available to the
courts. The court already has the power to disqualify a person from
participating in the keeping of animals and from being a party to an
arrangement under which a person is entitled to control or influence
the way animals are kept. We consider that the powers in Clause 33 are
already very wide and allow disqualifications which are enforceable and
will protect animals, so we do not think that disqualification orders
can be expected to prevent every future possible opportunity for
cruelty. They are meant to, and will, prevent offenders setting up
relationships of care and responsibility for animals whereby those
animals might suffer.</p><p><a name="06102316000435"></a>Finally,
for the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that a court may make both a
disqualification order as well as a deprivation order in respect of the
same case, if it so wishes. Clauses 32(1) and 33(1) both provide that
deprivation and disqualification orders may be made by the court
instead of or in addition to dealing with the offender in any other
way. Having said that in respect of the narrow point of Amendment No.
34, I hope that the desires expressed by both noble Baronesses are met
by the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102316000436"></a>There are some
government amendments in the same group. Amendments Nos. 35, 36, 53, 54
and 55 are necessary to apply the same powers to breaches of
disqualification orders made under old or new legislation. The group
includes four minor amendments that are necessary to correct references
contained in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102316000437"></a>Amendments
Nos. 35 and 36 amend the reference in subsection (9) to refer to an
order imposed under subsection (1), which is more correct. Amendment
No. 54 amends Clause 64, which deals with transitional
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102316000438"></a>The Bill will introduce
a much-needed power for the courts to order the seizure of animals from
someone who is found to be in breach of a disqualification order.
However, although Clause 33(9) makes it an offence to breach such a
disqualification order made under the Bill, it does not make it an
offence to breach an order made under the existing
legislation&#151;the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1954.
Clearly, we need to apply the same laws to both. Amendment No. 35
therefore plugs the breaches in the old disqualification into the
offences under Clause 33(9) and into the power in Clause 34 to order
seizure. I

they will under the Bill, are
satisfactory.<p><a name="06102316000452"></a>I was struck by
the recommendations of the EFRA Select Committee on the Bill, dated 8
September 2004&#151;which shows what a long time we have been
considering it&#151;with regard to the RSPCA. Its report points
out:</p><ul><a name="06102316000593"></a>&#147;As currently
drafted, there is nothing in the draft Bill to prevent an RSPCA
inspector, or an employee of any other charitable organisation, from
being appointed an inspector under the legislation, because the
Secretary of State is not prevented from including them on a list of
suitable persons. We have only Defra&#146;s stated intention that the
list will extend to only the State Veterinary Service and local
authorities. If this is indeed Defra&#146;s intention, then we
recommend that it should be specified on the face of the Bill.
Currently, the draft Bill effectively delegates an unlimited power to
the Secretary of State to decide who may act as an
inspector&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102316000453"></a>The
amendment would create a compromise between making the best use of
scarce resources and involving the RSPCA in the inspection of domestic
premises for welfare and cruelty offences only. However, it would
ensure that, while the RSPCA inspector would carry out that
investigation, the evidence gathered would have to be approved by the
state veterinary inspector.</p><p><a name="06102316000454"></a>That
would not only ensure that the quality of the evidence brought forward
to prosecution would be good, but also provide a deterrent to an
overzealous inspector, who would know that their evidence would be
subject to scrutiny. The amendment provides a bridge between the
reality of scarce resources and the need to establish good standards of
inspection.</p><p><a name="06102316000455"></a>Perhaps I may bring
to your Lordships&#146; attention a letter from David Catlow,
president of the BVA. It was written on behalf also of the Animal
Protection Agency, the Bio-Veterinary Group, BirdsFirst, Blue Cross,
the Born Free Foundation, the BVA, the Captive Animals Protection
Society, Cats Protection, Dogs Trust, IFAW, the Kennel Club, the League
Against Cruel Sports, the Monkey Sanctuary Trust, the PDSA and the Wood
Green Animal Shelter&#151;that is quite a list. They are seeking
clarification. The letter states:</p><ul><a name="06102316000594"></a>&#147;For example, the police
indicated that they felt their role was at the more extreme end of
cruelty and that they did not have the ability to take on the role
traditionally carried out by the RSPCA. Similarly, Local Authority
Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) felt that their work was
primarily aimed at the licensing of activities and not dealing with
pets in domestic
dwellings&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000456"></a>This would
appear to show a relatively clear delineation between the aspects of
work. I pass it to the Minister&#151;although I do not know whether
he has had it or not&#151;to share with us today. For example, farm
animals would be inspected by the State Veterinary Service, the
licensing and inspection of animals would be dealt with by the local
authority, while extreme violence towards animals would still be dealt
with by the police and general animal welfare duties would be
undertaken by the RSPCA. I do not know whether this is the
Government&#146;s thinking as well but, in moving my amendment, I am
trying to seek clarification.

October 2006, the bodies concerned went on to
say:</p><ul><a name="06102316000595"></a>&#147;Concerns have been
raised surrounding the public understanding of the differences in the
legislation, in particular the secondary legislation and whether the
public, let alone the enforcers, will know which laws apply
where&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102316000508"></a>and by
whom. They believe that
without,<ul><a name="06102316000647"></a>&#147;a clear
public information campaign this is likely to be a potential problem
along with the large border between England and Wales as well as the
border with
Scotland&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000509"></a>In the
opinion of these
organisations,<ul><a name="06102316000648"></a>&#147;there
is considerable variation and inconsistency in understanding and
application of current
legislation&#148;.</ul><a name="06102316000510"></a>They
are therefore concerned about the implementation and enforcement of the
legislation, particularly by local authorities, which have to bear some
of the initial challenges. With those few words, I beg to
move.<p><a name="06102316000458"></a><b><a name="61023-0009.htm_spnew161"></a><a name="06102316000832"></a>The

Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons.</p><p><a name="06102316000459"></a>Recently I had a
discussion with a neighbour who complained about the condition of some
sheep near her. She said, &#147;I keep reporting them to the RSPCA
but they don&#146;t want to know&#148;. At that stage she was not
aware that the local authority has an animal health inspector that will
come out and look at the sheep and, if the inspector is unhappy about
their condition, will get in touch with the State Veterinary Service.
However, if you ring the State Veterinary Service directly, you are
told to go to trading standards. So at the moment the situation is very
confusing, and it is not very much clearer in the Bill. I hope that the
Minister considers the noble Baroness&#146;s remarks very seriously
because we need proper demarcation lines. The public need to understand
to whom they can complain if they are concerned about an animal welfare
problem.</p><h5><a name="06102316000666"></a>6.45

but I shall get it looked into. There is clarity&#151;we are passing
legislation&#151;and the example given by the noble Countess would, I
hope, not affect many people, but it would affect some. People should
not be pushed from pillar to post. It is also important that the right
language is used, because there are different departments and they are
not always called the same in each local authority. The State
Veterinary Service needs to be aware of that when it gives information
to the public.</p><p><a name="06102316000461"></a>I have just
reread the part of my briefing headed &#147;purpose and

such as this one.</p><p><a name="06102316000462"></a>Clause 49

Bill. An inspector will be an officer of either a local authority or an
&#147;appropriate national authority&#148;. In practice, an
inspector of the

service inspector. Only those inspectors and police constables will be
able to exercise the powers of entry, search and seizure under the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102316000463"></a>Clause
49(2) will require local authorities to have regard to any guidance
issued by the appropriate national authority when they appoint their
inspectors for the purposes of the Bill. We anticipate that this
guidance will set out relevant criteria for appointing
inspectors&#151;qualifications, experience and so on&#151;and may
include a list of approved people who are considered suitable for such
an appointment.</p><p><a name="06102316000464"></a>Amendment No.
40A would require any inspector appointed under Clause 49 not to
present evidence without the approval of that evidence by the State
Veterinary Service. We are not clear, which is why we need to have some
discussions about it, whether the amendment is suggesting that local
authority officers cannot present evidence without the evidence being
approved by the SVS, or just inspectors appointed by a national
authority. In practice, under the Bill, an inspector will either be an
officer of a local authority or an SVS inspector. A local authority
could appoint someone on a temporary or part-time basis. Persons
appointed on such a basis would be authorised officers of the local
authority, and the authority would still be responsible for their
actions.</p><p><a name="06102316000465"></a>This amendment would
result in a lot of unnecessary administrative work for the SVS. It is
based on the false assumption that local authority inspectors do not
have the sense to recognise when they need to obtain advice from a
veterinary surgeon. We think it fails to understand that much of the
work a local authority inspector does is well within the competency of
a lay person and that input from a veterinarian is not needed. Where,
in the course of an application to a court or a prosecution, evidence
from a veterinarian is necessary, that will need to be obtained and
presented to the court. In some cases it will be appropriate for that
vet to be an employee of the SVS. In other cases, a private vet may be
the right person. I hope that that gives clarification.</p><p><a name="06102316000466"></a>We are currently looking at the protocol
between the police, the RSPCA, local authorities and the State
Veterinary Service. We do not anticipate any changes in how the law is
currently enforced. We are satisfied that we have a clear perception of
what their various roles are, notwithstanding the points I have made. I
thought it was worth putting that on the record. In the short time
available before Wednesday, or whatever day we have down for Third
Reading, I will get some clarification, particularly on the example I
was asked about by the noble Countess.</p><p><a name="06102316000467"></a><b><a name="61023-0009.htm_spnew163"></a><a name="06102316000834"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister.
As I explained to noble Lords, we had intended to raise this in
Committee. It is one of the issues I raised when we had a chance to
meet the Minister and his team, but perhaps they did not fully
understand what I was after. There is also the question of funding.
Local authorities have to make the best use of the money available to
them, and some local authorities might consider this a much less
important issue than others.</p>

noble Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to this amendment I shall also
speak to government Amendments Nos. 42 to 48, which are grouped with
it. They are largely technical and ensure consistency with the Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act, which came into force in July 2005. In
addition, Amendment No. 48 gives limited powers of search and seizure
to inspectors who enter premises in an
emergency.</p><p><a name="06102316000474"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 to
47 are minor amendments&#151;although Amendment No. 46 looks like a
significant change&#151;purely to ensure consistent drafting. They
make no substantive changes. Schedule 2 extends the safeguards in
Sections 15 and 16 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to
inspectors under the Bill. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act
made a few changes to Sections 15 and 16, and so a few equivalent
changes to Schedule 2 are necessary to take account of this. I am happy
to go through other amendments in
detail.</p><p><a name="06102316000475"></a>Amendment No. 48 serves
two purposes. The first is to ensure that where an inspector enters
premises to search for an animal in distress he has the power to
inspect the animal when he finds it. This is a necessary prerequisite
to exercising all the emergency powers in Clause 18 and I do not think
that I need dwell further on it. The second purpose is to give
inspectors limited powers to gather evidence. As currently drafted, the
power to remove carcasses and take photographs is limited to occasions
when the inspector has entered either under warrant under Clause 22, or
to conduct a routine inspection under Clauses 25 to
28.</p><p><a name="06102316000476"></a>However, where an inspector
has entered to search for an animal in distress he may find it has
already died, or that it needs to be destroyed. In both cases he will
need to remove the carcass, as a post-mortem examination will be
necessary for any subsequent prosecution that may be brought. Likewise,
he may need to photograph the conditions the animal has been kept in
for use as evidence in any future
prosecution.</p>

noble Lord said: My Lords, I am grateful to have the opportunity for
this debate on whether the operation of the tax credit system is
satisfactory. The new tax credits&#151;the child tax credit and the
working tax credit&#151;were introduced in April 2003. The most
recent parliamentary review of them by the House of Commons Treasury
Select Committee was published in June this year. It is a cross-party
document, and I have taken it as the best non-partisan source for my
remarks tonight. I will cover three problem areas that are highlighted
in particular: first, overpayment of the credit to claimants; secondly
fraud and organised crime; and thirdly the way forward to improve the
system.</p><p><a name="06102324000005"></a>The Government state
that the tax credit regime provides support for 6 million families and
10 million children. However, in 2003-04 about one-third of all tax
credit awards paid&#151;nearly 1.9 million awards&#151;were
overpaid at a cost of nearly &#163;2 billion. In 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>December 2005, the Paymaster General indicated that, but for reforms
announced in the Pre-Budget Report 2005,</p><ul><a name="06102324000117"></a>&#147;initial estimates had
suggested that subsequent years&#146; overpayments would have been of
broadly the same level as in
2003-04&#148;.</ul><a name="06102324000104"></a>I am not
certain if the overpayment figures for 2004-05 and 2005-06 have been
published yet. Will the Minister give me those figures? For 2003-04, of
the 1.879 million claimants who received overpayments, about 41,000
received overpayments of &#163;5,000 or more. Half the total
overpayments related to some 283,000 families, who had been overpaid by
&#163;2,000 or more. <p><a name="06102324000006"></a>The
National Audit Office explained why the design of tax credits
necessarily results in overpayments. It
said,</p><ul><a name="06102324000111"></a>&#147;A tax credit
award is provisionally based on a family&#146;s income and
circumstances from the preceding tax year. The award is finalised after
the end of the tax year once income and circumstances are known for
certain. The final award will be lower than the provisional award where
incomes increase, although the first
&#163;2,500&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102324000105"></a>now
up to
&#163;25,000&#151;<ul><a name="06102324000118"></a>&#147;of
any income increase is
disregarded&#148;.</ul><a name="06102324000106"></a>However,
the NAO also
stated:<ul><a name="06102324000112"></a>&#147;Further
unforeseen overpayments have
occurred&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102324000007"></a>Full
recovery of overpayments from 2003-04 is expected to take nearly five
years. To date, the Government have written off some &#163;95 million
of overpayments and have made provision for a further &#163;961
million to be written off eventually. The committee says that the
factors cited by the Paymaster General and her officials as
contributing to the causes of overpayments do not given the full
reasons why the overpayments have arisen. The Paymaster General has
referred only to those causes of overpayments that can be attributed to
error by the claimant, or omission, or to the design of the tax credits
regime, or a combination of those. The Paymaster General, in the
committee&#146;s view, makes no reference to causes of overpayments
that have arisen due to HMRC&#146;s own processes&#151;for example,
official error and information technology system error. Does the
Minister agree with the committee&#146;s
conclusions?</p><p><a name="06102324000008"></a>The report goes on
to state that recent research indicates that the tax credits regime,
which is designed to deliver the correct amount of state assistance
over the year as a whole, could be aligned more closely to the
financial needs of those families who tend to and need to budget over a
month or less, rather than the whole of a tax year. The committee goes
on to say that it is obvious that HMRC cannot, however, as a whole take
steps to improve the way that it administers tax credits without first
identifying and developing a detailed understanding of the factors that
cause overpayments and the extent to which each individual factor has
contributed to the overpayments problem. It recommends that as a
priority the Government should provide a detailed breakdown of as much
of that information as is currently available. Does the Minister agree,
and will he provide the House with the necessary
information?</p><p><a name="06102324000009"></a>The committee is
clear that official error has been a cause of overpayments in a
significant number of 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1057"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1057</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cases. The Paymaster General has said that no complete analysis exists
of official error causing or contributing to overpayments. In my view,
that is a significant gap in HMRC&#146;s understanding of the reasons
that overpayments arise. Does the Minister not agree with the
committee&#146;s view that if HMRC is to succeed in improving the
administration of the tax credits regime, it first needs to understand
what is going wrong within its own processes before it looks to
problems elsewhere? Does he not agree also with the committee&#146;s
argument that the Government should undertake a complete analysis of
the incidence of official error and the extent to which that causes or
contributes to overpayments, that they should publish that analysis,
and that if they cannot carry out such analysis, they should explain
why?</p><p><a name="06102324000010"></a>The committee also believes
that HMRC has failed to assess the contribution made by information
technology error. It recommends that the Government undertake a
complete analysis of the incidence of that and the extent to which it
causes or contributes to overpayment, and that they publish that
analysis. Does the Minister
agree?</p><p><a name="06102324000011"></a>The IT system delivered
by EDS for running the new tax credits system was unsatisfactory in
several respects, as was highlighted by the NAO&#146;s evidence to
the committee. Yet, when the Government ended the contract with EDS in
June 2004, an extraordinary agreement was made. While the Government
were to be compensated for EDS&#146;s mistakes by &#163;71.25
million, up to &#163;26.5 million of that, in staged payments, would
be contingent on EDS winning new business with the UK Government. But
there was no guarantee that EDS would win sufficient business to
trigger payment of the full
amount.</p><p><a name="06102324000012"></a>The
committee strongly questioned the wisdom of an agreement that made the
payment of compensation to the affected government department by the
provider of that unsatisfactory service contingent on that provider
winning other contracts with the Government. The committee&#146;s
concern, rightly, is that contingent payments will influence future
decisions by Government departments to award contracts. It believes
that:</p><ul><a name="06102324000113"></a>&#147;The agreement
has the appearance of impropriety, if not the
fact&#148;.</ul><a name="06102324000107"></a>Can the
Minister say whether the full &#163;26.5 million has been received
and how many government contracts have been awarded to EDS since June
2004?<p><a name="06102324000013"></a>On the recovery of
overpayments, I agree with the committee that HMRC should not seek to
recover either an excess payment made in the current year or an
overpayment from the previous year until it has come to a decision on
whether the excess should be recovered, in accordance with COP 26,
which requires two questions to be answered satisfactorily: did HMRC
make a mistake and, if so, was it reasonable for the claimant to think
that his or her payments were correct? Why do the Government appear to
be delaying implementation of the &#147;pause before recovery&#148;
of an overpayment? In any case, is there not a statutory right of
appeal to a tribunal, under Section 12 of the Social Security Act 1998?
Does the 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1058"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1058</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister support calls from the voluntary sector and the ombudsman for
the introduction of an appeal to an independent
tribunal?</p><p><a name="06102324000014"></a>On the subject of
fraud, error and organised crime, I am concerned, as is the committee,
that it is now over two years since the end of the 2003-04 tax year,
yet HMRC has yet to establish the final levels of claimant error and
fraud in the tax credits regime for that year. An interim figure of 3.4
per cent has been indicated, but the committee understands that the
figure will be significantly
higher.</p><p><a name="06102324000015"></a>Apparently,
organised criminals were able to make claims over the internet without
proving their identity. However, HMRC&#146;s internal office
concluded that there was a lack of comprehensive information to allow a
robust analysis of the problem. Then, in December 2005, HMRC announced
the closure of its tax credits portal, following attempts to defraud
the tax credits regime by making claims through it. Those claims
falsely used internal information held by DWP about its staff. The
Paymaster General admitted in February 2006 that some 8,800 staff
identities may have been stolen in 2003-04. Of those, 6,800 had been
used in an attempt to defraud the tax credits regime in
2005.</p><p><a name="06102324000016"></a>The
Paymaster General gave details of another fraud, involving the use of
identities stolen from Network Rail employees, stating that
HMRC&#146;s investigations had resulted in at least 16,000 claims
being stopped. The Paymaster General also disclosed that, from April
2004 to November 2005, HMRC intervened on approximately 56,000
incorrect claims where fraud was suspected, of which HMRC estimated
that 19,500 arose as a result of organised attacks. From October 2004
to November 2005, HMRC identified and stopped over 22,000 tax credit
claims in payment where organised fraud was suspected.</p><p><a name="06102324000017"></a>Does the Minister have any updated
figures of the loss to HMRC due to fraud, other than the figure of
&#163;2.7 million from the DWP fraud and the &#163;15 million
general figure from organised fraud as stated by the NAO in the
committee report? Can he guarantee that there are no plans to reduce
the number of staff in the tax credits compliance department of
HMRC?</p><p><a name="06102324000018"></a>My final
subject on the report is the way forward. I welcome the fact that the
Government are seeking to improve the operation of the tax credits
regime by introducing a package of reforms. However, how can they be
confident of their estimates of the overall costs of the package? For
instance, they expect the package to be broadly revenue neutral, but
how will this be when the disregard threshold is being increased from
&#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000, which could prove
costly?</p><p><a name="06102324000019"></a>We on these
Benches believe that HMRC should improve its service to claimants. We
want the tax credits system to work properly so that those who are most
deserving benefit from it. We want to make the system as user-friendly
as possible so that no one will be put off by its complexity and we
want its administration to be as efficient as possible. Therefore, I
commend the Treasury Committee report and look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response.</p>

Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, I think that I would
like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, for his introduction to
this short debate tonight. He is certainly right to bring to the
House&#146;s attention some of the ongoing concerns surrounding tax
credits, which we all recognise are a powerful government tool to
address child poverty&#151;it is a tool of which I, for one, am very
proud.</p><p><a name="06102324000021"></a>Tax credits probably
would not have been necessary in Beveridge&#146;s time, but now that
wages are individual wages and not family wages&#151;rightly so,
given changing demography, lifestyles and family patterns, as well as
the fluidity of family forms and of labour&#151;the state, rightly in
my view, takes responsibility for additional payments where necessary
to reflect family need and family dependency. That started with Eleanor
Rathbone&#146;s family allowances in 1948, going through to the
family income supplement, which was introduced by the party opposite,
to family credit, and now to tax
credit.</p><p><a name="06102324000022"></a>If I have any criticism
of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, it is that he did not
contextualise it by suggesting in any way the extent to which tax
credits have begun to bridge some of the gaps in after-pay earnings
between rich and poor and between the childless and families with
children. Tax credits also, rather interestingly, bridge the gap
between entry wages and median wages; the 40 per cent difference
between the two is one of the biggest gaps in Europe, so tax credits
help to sustain people who are in low-paid jobs. Tax credits also
bridge the gap between women&#146;s full-time and men&#146;s
full-time work, and between women&#146;s part-time and men&#146;s
full-time work&#151;we know that pay rates for women&#146;s
part-time work are roughly 50 per cent lower than pay rates for
men.</p><p><a name="06102324000023"></a>In all
these problems in the distribution patterns in our society, tax credits
have made a major contribution. But, as is inevitable in any such
redistribution, there will be trade-offs that conflict with each other.
I shall describe two of the most complex. First, if you make
out-of-work benefits sufficiently generous&#151;especially for larger
families, in tackling child poverty&#151;you can make it more
problematic for people to find it worth while to go into work. That is
why in the 1970s we had the wage stop. We call that situation the
poverty trap, in which it is not worth working. The second problem is
that, as tax credits are rightly related to income, and therefore
withdrawn as income rises, there can be a very high deduction rate,
along with tax and NI, for every extra pound earned. That is what we
call the employment trap. Of course, one could reduce the taper and
make it less severe, but then the problem moves higher up the income
scale. In any case, the problem is not the taper but the interaction
with other means-tested benefits&#151;above all, housing benefit and
council tax benefit.</p><p><a name="06102324000024"></a>There are
no right answers to this, just judgments to be made about how we trade
the one problem off against the other. It is worth stating that some of
those concerns may be more theoretical than real. On the poverty trap,
for example, it is clear from research that people work for more than
money: they work for adult status, autonomy, pride and family 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1060"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1060</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>responsibility. As a result, the reserve wage that a number of people
will take is amazingly low&#151;often barely at benefit
level&#151;and that will be sufficient to bring them into the labour
market. However, if a job is difficult to sustain around fluctuating
childcare problems and if the pay is not good enough, a lone parent in
particular is more vulnerable to dropping out of the labour market. The
Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that over the past 10 years or
so, the levels of both the poverty trap and the employment trap have
been reduced, largely due to tax credits.</p><p><a name="06102324000025"></a>As for the problem of tapers and the
complaint that, once in work, too much of each pound that a person
earns goes in deductions, you obviously cannot simply universalise the
benefit and then take it away from the better off. The income tax bands
are not sufficiently progressive and it would be too expensive to do
that. In 1997, I estimated that putting &#163;10 on each and every
benefit would wipe out almost the entire expenditure on the NHS, as it
stood at that time, and still leave families poor. It cannot be done in
that way.</p><p><a name="06102324000026"></a>The result is that we
have constructed a tax credit system which, rightly I think, has a
sharp taper for adults&#151;the working tax credit&#151;and a
shallower taper for children. In its recent report, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies has shown that both incentives to work and progress
within work, though varying by family type, have largely improved
satisfactorily over the past few years.</p><p><a name="06102324000027"></a>Therefore, the first problem is the
generalised one of targeting, means-testing, the poverty trap and the
employment trap. I was sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, did
not refer to that in his otherwise very detailed and analytical
speech.</p><p><a name="06102324000028"></a>The second problem, to
which he devoted most of his time, is what the Opposition, and he
today, have called &#147;errors&#148;. It is fair to say that when
we introduced the Tax Credits Bill we did not predict that 50 per cent
of lone parents would undergo more than a dozen changes in circumstance
a year. Those include changes in childcare arrangements virtually every
school holiday, changes in hours worked and sometimes a change of
partner. The result is that if, as the noble Lord suggests, you seek to
track every change and every three to four weeks change the credit for
half the population claiming tax credits, even if the computer could
handle it, I doubt very much whether the lone parent could. Such
adjustments would be made six weeks in arrears and there would be no
way in which that parent would be able to construct a family budget
with such unreliable and non-robust flows of income, especially as some

<p><a name="06102324000029"></a>That is why the Government, rightly in my
view, went for a balance-sheet adjustment at the end of the year. The
problems occurred disproportionately because, again, I think that the
Government underestimated the occasions on which the female in a couple
household went into work and produced a major increase in family
income&#151;often used to pay off the debts acquired by the couple
over the previous years&#151;but that was not reported early enough. 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, at the end of the year, the couple faced a very large
overpayment bill, which the departments involved rightly sought to
reclaim. It is a fact of human nature that people are much more likely
to report a drop than a rise in income. The Government increased the
head space from &#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000 so that in the one year
in which the female goes back to work the couple is not bedevilled by
these problems&#151;it may be the one opportunity that they have to
pay off their debts. Simultaneously, the Government also require
monthly, as opposed to three-monthly, reviews of information. I hope
that those measures together will address the problem.</p><p><a name="06102324000030"></a>As for errors in the conventional sense,
mentioned by the noble Lord, I was amazed at how few there are.
Something like 95 per cent of the poorest families&#151;lone
parents&#151;claim their entitlement. There is something like a 98
per cent accuracy rate, which is amazingly
good.</p><p><a name="06102324000031"></a>I have three questions for
my noble friend. The first concerns the problems associated with larger
families. Half of all poor children live in larger families&#151;not
necessarily one-parent families, but often couple families who are out
of work, or black, minority ethnic families. Yet in Britain we
concentrate benefit and support on the first child. In most of Europe,
more money goes to later children in the family. Will my noble friend
tell us the Government&#146;s thinking on introducing either a
later-child premium or some balancing factor, so that that problem can
be addressed? The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that that
would be the single most effective tool in simultaneously reducing
out-of-work poverty for children and increasing in-work incentives for
parents because they would continue to take that premium into work with
them. I hope that my noble friend can give us some good news on
that.</p><p><a name="06102324000032"></a>My second question for my
noble friend is whether grandparents who provide childcare might be
eligible for the childcare tax credit. At the moment it goes only to
registered childminders, but the real test for a lone parent on whether
she is willing to go into work and sustain work when it gets
difficult&#151;if the child is sickly or if there are difficulties in
hours&#151;is whether she has childcare that she can trust, that she
is confident in and that will hang on in. That is usually childcare of
the sort that she would give, provided by someone who loves the child,
so that the mother is guilt-free. That often means childcare by her own
mother. Those grandparents may themselves have been lone parents, often
living in poor estates. Such a measure would allow us to help three
generations of families: the women in their 50s who need to work, their
daughters who seek work and their children whom we must lift out of
poverty. What is my noble friend doing on
that?</p><p><a name="06102324000033"></a>Finally, we have a
national minimum wage and national levels of tax credits. Yet we all
know that the cost of living, transport and housing varies widely
within the UK between the south-east and other regions. Has the
Government&#146;s thinking moved at all on a regional premium on the
minimum wage or on tax credits? If so, what will happen?</p>



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102324000034"></a>Tax credits have been
transforming for families&#151;particularly for lone parents. A young
mother with a child who would be earning barely &#163;5 or just above
on a minimum wage can take home a man&#146;s wage&#151;double that.
Because she has a tax credit that makes working pay, and a child tax
credit that is earnings related, which means it keeps pace with rises
in real wages, we have been able to transform the opportunities for
lone parents and their children. Tax credits are a government measure
of which I am hugely proud, which along with the introduction of the
minimum wage have been transforming for parents and children
alike.</p><h5><a name="06102324000123"></a>7.18
pm</h5><p><a name="06102324000035"></a><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew174"></a><a name="06102324000130"></a>Viscount
Trenchard:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to my
noble friend Lord Northbrook for introducing the debate on tax credits.
My gratitude is without the reservation shown by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollis.</p><p><a name="06102324000036"></a>I am surprised
that it has taken so long for the public at large to ascertain just how
inefficient and wasteful is the absurdly complex system of taxes, tax
credits and benefits that the Government have introduced. The
Government spent &#163;15.4 billion on tax credits in 2006-07
compared with &#163;2.4 billion spent on family credit in 1997-98.
The increase in expenditure is equal to more than 4p on the basic rate
of income tax. Will the Minister tell us the total cost in the past
year of administering the tax credit system, including reclaiming
overpayments? Further, will he tell the House what that sum would
translate to in terms of the basic rate of income
tax?</p><p><a name="06102324000037"></a>As
proposed by my noble friend Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, and his Tax
Reform Commission in an excellent report published last week, the need
for tax credits could be reduced by increasing the personal allowance
and making it transferable between parents of young children. The tax
credits system is so complicated as to be incomprehensible to most
people, and a severe disincentive to those in work but on low incomes
to work harder and earn higher salaries or win promotion, because the
progressive withdrawal of tax credits has created an effective marginal
rate of 70 per cent or more for many workers. As the Institute for
Fiscal Studies has pointed out, the weakest work incentives are
encountered by people on low incomes who face having their means-tested
benefits or tax credits withdrawn if they increase their income. More
than 2 million workers in Britain stand to lose more than half of any
increase in earnings to taxes and reduced benefits. Some 160,000 would
keep less than 10 pence of each extra pound they
earned.</p><p><a name="06102324000038"></a>Tax
credits have provided some incentive for people to move from
unemployment into low-paid employment. However, as the report of my
noble friend Lord Forsyth pointed out, they are not well focused on
reducing poverty. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, has
claimed that tax credits have made a great contribution to reducing the
gap between rich and poor, and between men and women. However, child
tax credits can be claimed by families earning nearly three times the
average national income. The poorest fifth of households are therefore
paying a higher share of tax, and receiving a lower share of benefits,
than they were when the 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1063"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1063</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government came to power. As my noble friend Lord Blackwell pointed out
in his excellent paper, <I>Take Poor Families Out of Tax</I>, published
in October last year, a further disadvantage of the tax credits system
is that, since credits are calculated on the previous year&#146;s
income, many families find that their income fluctuates widely. If
their income rises, they may find themselves faced with an unexpected
and unaffordable bill to pay back credit payments which they have
already spent.</p><p><a name="06102324000039"></a>This inefficient
system has created a serious and expensive problem of benefit fraud.
For three consecutive years, the extent of overpayments due to error or
fraud has led the National Audit Office to qualify its audits of taxes
and tax credits. My noble friend Lord Northbrook has already well
illustrated this point.</p><p><a name="06102324000040"></a>&#147;Tax credits&#148; is a
misnomer. These benefit payments are not credits against taxes. The
Government massively overtax low-income families and then, at enormous
administrative cost, give money back to the same people. In the
process, they create a demotivating dependency culture and
remove&#151;or substantially dilute&#151;incentives for people to
better themselves.</p><p><a name="06102324000041"></a>There is, or
was, another kind of tax credit: dividend tax credits. Mr Liam
Halligan, economics editor of the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>, said in his
excellent article of 15 October that Terry Arthur, a fellow of the
Institute of Actuaries, supported by Watson Wyatt, calculates that the
Chancellor&#146;s first and worst stealth tax raid, the abolition of
dividend tax credits&#151;real credits against corporation
tax&#151;had actually cost pension schemes up to &#163;150 billion.
The Minister may, or may not, remember that, in the debate on the Loyal
Address on 18 May last year, I estimated that the stealth tax raid had
actually cost some &#163;166 billion. I am no actuary, but I feel I
am in good company now.</p><p><a name="06102324000042"></a>Against
the background of changing demographics, the Chancellor&#146;s raid
on our pension funds was the largest single factor leading to the
present crisis in retirement provision. It is therefore all the more
necessary to cast away the cumbersome, wasteful and highly inefficient
scheme of working tax credit and child tax credits without delay and
use the savings to procure a substantial increase in the personal tax
allowance to, say, at least &#163;7,500, transferable between
spouses, thus freeing millions of people from the burden of paying tax
at all. It will be hard for the Minister to claim that the operation of
the tax credit system is satisfactory, and I look forward to his
reply.</p><h5><a name="06102324000124"></a>7.25

Giddens:</b> My Lords, tax credits do not seem to be
bringing out noble Lords in droves, especially during their dinnertime,
but I shall be less diffident than my noble friend Lady Hollis in
thanking the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, for initiating this debate.
Tax credits may not be in the foxhunting league, but their impact on
the country is much greater.</p><p><a name="06102324000044"></a>Tax
credits have a long history. They were initiated in the United States
in the 1970s by Senator Russell 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1064"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1064</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Long. They began as a relatively uncontroversial, small scheme of
incentives to get to people into work. They were generalised during the
Clinton Administration, and they effectively became a very large
anti-poverty programme. As the noble Lord mentioned, tax credits have
been used for many other purposes&#151;for example, President Clinton
introduced environmental tax credits&#151;but I shall speak mainly on
the relationship between tax credits and the alleviation of poverty
because that is where they are most
important.</p><p><a name="06102324000045"></a>If
we look at the record of the Clinton Administration, the impact of tax
credits was immense. They were the main reason why approximately 10
million people were lifted out of poverty during his period in power.
At the end of that period, the number of people below the poverty line
in the United States was the lowest it had been for 25 years. In the
United States, it was a very successful policy, and it is not
surprising that it was initiated here, albeit under a different name:
the working families&#146; tax credit.</p><p><a name="06102324000046"></a>As my noble friend Lady
Hollis said, tax credits are a powerful instrument. That is so for
several reasons, and it is important to bear them in mind when
discussing issues of complication, overpayment and so forth. First,
they are non-stigmatising. They are not perceived, as orthodox, passive
benefits often are, as stigmatising to the people who claim them and to
the rest of the population who fund them. That is an important quality
of tax credits compared with orthodox benefit payments. Secondly, they
are a positive incentive for job search and job creation more
generally. When Senator Long introduced tax credits, they were a
reaction against Milton Friedman&#146;s negative income tax, one of
the problems of which was that it would effectively have acted as a
disincentive to work, unlike tax credits. Thirdly, tax credits connect
social policy and economic policy. That is why they have been such an
important element of government policy. They get a lot of people into
work and alleviate poverty at the same time because we know the best
way of doing that is to get people into jobs. At the same time, they
directly contribute to economic dynamism. There are very few social
policies that do both those things.</p><p><a name="06102324000047"></a>The record of this country in job
creation and employment is substantial. Some of the major EU economies,
such as France or Germany, have about 64 or 63 per cent of
the labour force in work. In the UK, about 74 per cent of the labour
force is in work&#151;one of the top figures not only in the EU but
among OECD countries. That is crucial, because it generates the tax
revenue that makes possible investment in public
services.</p><p><a name="06102324000048"></a>A fourth reason why
tax credits are so important is that, unlike many other benefits
systems, they have a proven track record. They have been used in the
United States for quite some time and a large number of studies show
that they work: they benefit some of the poorest sectors of society
and, crucially, they provide an important and direct incentive for job
search and job creation.</p><p><a name="06102324000049"></a>One
must concede, as my noble friend Lady Hollis conceded, that there are
problems with tax credits. The question is whether those problems are,
in the 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1065"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1065</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>light of what the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, said, structural or the
result of how they are implemented. That is crucial. One should
recognise that all benefits have problems. Again, as my noble friend
said, if you have a straightforward universal benefits system, the
problem is that a lot of money goes to people who do not really need
it. There will always be problems and dilemmas in the relationship
between targeted and universal benefits. No system is
perfect.</p><p><a name="06102324000050"></a>The first problem, much
discussed in the British press recently, is that of overpayment. It is
best to look to the United States to see whether that is a structural
problem or whether it is largely the result of the computer
system&#151;or, I think one must say, mistakes made. The evidence
from the United States is pretty clear. There was overpayment in the
beginning in the United States. That has been radically reduced. There
was a lot of fraud initially in the United States, but that has been
radically reduced. There is still some overpayment in the US, but it is
much less than it was. That leads me to conclude that overpayment is
not primarily a structural problem of tax credits and that we should be
following the same procedures as have been instituted in the United
States to reduce those
problems.</p><p><a name="06102324000051"></a>The
second issue, also mentioned by noble Lords, is the fact that the tax
credits are complicated and difficult to understand. If I may say so,
one must have a nuanced view of that. Simplicity is of course a virtue,
but it is not the sole virtue of a tax system, especially when we
recognise the crucial fact that fiscal systems have an impact on
behaviour. That is a crucial aspect of what tax credits do. Much more
important than sheer simplicity is whether they do the job of bringing
the money to the right people in the right way at the right time. I
take it that that was the point raised by the noble Lord. I think that
we must have a flexible system. Therefore, I am not in favour of the
proposal that seems to have been made by the Liberal Democrats of
having a six-month stable payment. Because poverty is so complex and
changes so much even during the course of a year, you must have a
flexible system. One of the main things that we have discovered about
poverty is that it is not a unitary state. Poverty has so many
different faces and any system must be tailored to
that.</p><p><a name="06102324000052"></a>Thirdly, we must be
careful that the old poverty traps do not return. That can happen if
tax credits are not properly adjusted as times and income levels
change. We know that the old poverty traps put poorer people in a
terrible situation of having a much higher marginal rate of taxation
than more wealthy people. There is a danger that the tax credit system
can drift towards that as well if we do not modify it as it goes along.
I would like to hear the Minister's comments on what has been said by
members of our party, such as Alan Milburn, who has expressed
reservations from that point of view and, perhaps, on the recent
Rowntree report, which also expressed reservations about that. That is
an important part of the
debate.</p><p><a name="06102324000053"></a>However, I very much
diverge from the noble Lord over tax credits. I think he would have to
look very hard to find another system that links together 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1066"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1066</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increasing social justice, economic dynamism and employment in a
single-policy system. It would be a great mistake to disentangle them,
which is why I was very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord
Northbrook, say that he fully supported the idea of tax credits in
principle. I think that is what he
said.</p><p><a name="06102324000054"></a>Finally, anyone can make a
mistake about tax systems and fail to understand them. I leave noble
Lords with this little story. A tax inspector goes to see a businessman
with a multi-million pound business. He knocks on the office door and
says, &#147;I&#146;m the man from the VAT&#148;. The businessman
behind the desk says, &#147;You&#146;re a bit premature. I
haven&#146;t decided whether I will join
yet&#148;.</p><h5><a name="06102324000125"></a>7.35

Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, this has
been a short debate but one that shows some of the strengths of this
House. We have had a good range of people talking about practical
difficulties in the system, as well as with great expertise about its
more theoretical
aspects.</p><p><a name="06102324000056"></a>I
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, on keeping this problem
in front of us and on continuing to try to hold the Government to
account. He painted a serious picture, which I believe is correct, of
continuing inefficiency, overpayments, underpayments, error and fraud
in the tax credits system.</p><p><a name="06102324000057"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke with her unique combination of
commitment and expertise, and I will certainly develop her argument
about the employment and poverty trap and about the effect of housing
and other benefits. I do not, however, agree with the thrust of her
summary of the very important Institute for Fiscal Studies report,
supported by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, about which I propose to
say a little more.</p><p><a name="06102324000058"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Giddens, also gave us a useful historical sweep, but I
cannot agree that tax credits are not a disincentive to work. A careful
study of the IFS report would make him think very hard about that.
Briefly, he spoke about the Liberal Democrat proposals to re-fix tax
credits every six months. I agree that flexibility is fine, and
obviously one would like the system to work better. The problem at the
moment is that the system seems to be seizing up, and re-fixing tax
credits every six months is a short-term practical proposal to
help.</p><p><a name="06102324000059"></a>The
noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, concentrated on administrative costs
and reclaiming overpayments, and followed the main thrust of the noble
Lord, Lord Northbrook. I notice that he called the Forsyth
commission&#146;s report excellent. Is the noble Baroness, Lady
Noakes, allowed to agree with that from the Conservative Front Bench,
or would it break Mr Osborne&#146;s vow of silence? He seems
to have invented a whole new concept. Noble Lords may remember that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer used to go into pre-Budget purdah for a few
weeks. The new Osborne doctrine seems to be that shadow Chancellors go
into pre-election purdah for about four or five years and cannot talk
about tax at all.</p>

trade-off: work incentives and income redistribution in Britain</I>,
which came out earlier this month. I pay tribute yet again to the great
work that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation does in supporting valuable
public-policy initiatives of this kind. The conclusions were that
Labour&#146;s reforms to date have acted to weaken both incentives to
be in work at all and incentives for those in work to increase their
earnings. It rightly draws particular attention to the fact that
housing benefit recipients have some of the weakest work incentives of
all. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pointed out, it is the
interaction of that with other benefits that really makes marginal tax
rates on poor people very high. The Government must face up to this
very serious disincentive to work and let people on housing benefit,
particularly, keep more of their earnings as they work
more.</p><p><a name="06102324000061"></a>The IFS report refers to
lone parents, whom Labour talk about a great deal, and points out that
this group still has the weakest work incentives of the six demographic
groups that it considered. It says that the number of lone parents has
more than doubled since 1979 and that this should be a key focus for
the attention of policy makers. The IFS goes into considerable detail
and puts a very powerful case when it states
that,</p><ul><a name="06102324000119"></a>&#147;the reforms
that do the most damage to work incentives are the same aggressively
means-tested ones that do most to help the
poor&#148;.</ul><a name="06102324000108"></a>We have to
face that increasing the child element of CTC in particular would
reduce the incentive to work substantially for large numbers of people.
The report points out how a classic increase in means-tested support is
very successful in targeting money at the poor, but is very weak for
work incentives. In the face of this evidence, I do not see how the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens, can argue that work incentives are not
weakened. <p><a name="06102324000062"></a>This short debate
has focused on operational difficulties, but more on what I would call
fundamental design faults in the tax credits system, which, because it
is so complicated, makes it operationally very difficult and
undoubtedly affects work incentives.</p><p><a name="06102324000063"></a><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew177"></a><a name="06102324000133"></a>Lord

what he just said? I am not sure whether he is arguing against me or
not. I was arguing that negative income taxes tend not to work because
basically they are disincentives to work, whereas tax credit systems
work much better. If they are fine-tuned properly, they help to get a
lot more people into
work.</p><p><a name="06102324000064"></a><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew178"></a><a name="06102324000134"></a>Lord

noble Lord for that. I do not think that I misheard him. I do not
disagree with him on negative income tax, but I understood him to say
that tax credits did not have disincentive effects. Obviously, I accept
that he was talking particularly about America, which may have had
longer to refine the operation of the system. My point in encouraging
people to study this IFS report is that as tax credits

work, particularly for the poorest in our society. The principle is
that it is quite wrong that the poorest people in society should face a
much higher marginal tax rate than the richest people, which is the
situation that we have at the moment. In Britain, we have 2 million
workers who face a marginal tax rate of more than 50p in the pound and
160,000 who face a marginal tax rate of more than 90p in the pound,
which is a very serious indictment of a Government after nine years in
office.</p><p><a name="06102324000065"></a><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew179"></a><a name="06102324000135"></a>Baroness
Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, I apologise for
intervening again on the noble Lord&#146;s contribution, which is
extremely interesting. The IFS report goes into detailed analysis of
household types in chapters 5 and 6 in particular, tracks them
longitudinally over time and sets against that an array of different
possible interventions available to Government&#151;large family
premium, CTC, working family tax credit and so on. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies recognises, first, that incentives to go into and to
stay in work are stronger in 2005 than in 1979 and that, secondly,
notwithstanding all the other possible remedies&#151;though some may
be more effective than others&#151;there is very little scope. Does
the noble Lord agree that because of the trade-offs built into any
system linking social and economic policy, government interventions
would make differences at the margins that might be worth having, but
that that does not mean&#151;the IFS never says this&#151;that tax
credits as a policy should be abandoned as a
result?</p><p><a name="06102324000066"></a><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew180"></a><a name="06102324000136"></a>Lord

not say that they should be abandoned. I know of course that the noble

No one is suggesting that things have not improved since 1979: it would
be a grim state of affairs if they had not. It says that identifying
those very serious disincentive effects&#151;there are various
charts&#151;for some groups shows that tax credits in their current
form are not working for those groups. Given all the improvements that
have been made under the noble Baroness among other people, that is

Noakes:</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Northbrook
has chosen for debate today a very important question which has had too
little attention in your Lordships&#146; House. I agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that it has been a wide-ranging and
thoughtful debate which has shown the strength of the House. It has
also, incidentally, given my noble friend Lord Trenchard another
opportunity to remind the House about the Chancellor&#146;s raid on
pension funds by way of dividend tax
credits.</p>

<p><a name="06102324000068"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, taunted me with my noble friend Lord
Trenchard&#146;s reference to the report last week of my noble friend
Lord Forsyth&#151;the Tax Commission&#146;s report&#151;which he
described as excellent. 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I can certainly confirm that the official view is that it is an
excellent report. That does not, of course, make it Conservative Party
policy.</p><p><a name="06102324000069"></a>The importance of tax
credits goes beyond the routine assessment of government policies,
because they are the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s personal
project, and they give us insight into the Chancellor and his aims. The
outcomes of the scheme must reflect on him. That is important when we
start to look at what might happen if the Chancellor moves into No. 10
as he clearly wishes to in the immediate
future.</p><p><a name="06102324000070"></a>The Chancellor said some
four years ago, when he was launching an advertising campaign for tax
credits, that:</p><ul><a name="06102324000114"></a>&#147;The new
tax credits ... are central to this Government&#146;s goals of
not only tackling child poverty and making work pay but ensuring family
prosperity for
all&#148;.</ul><a name="06102324000109"></a>Those were the
goals he set four years ago. During Starred Questions, the Minister
told the House that these goals had been achieved. He said
that,<ul><a name="06102324000115"></a>&#147;this has been
an ambitious system that has delivered three key achievements. It has
improved incentives to work; it has reduced the tax burden on low- to
middle-income families; and it has helped dramatically to reduce child
poverty&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/6/06; col.
1259.]</ul><a name="06102324000110"></a>I should like to
examine these claims and set what has been achieved against the very
real problems that exist in the tax credits system, which my noble
friend Lord Northbrook laid out so
well.<p><a name="06102324000071"></a>The first claim made by
the Minister was that the tax credits system has improved incentives to
work. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred extensively to the IFS
study on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#151;neither
organisation could be said to be a spokesman for Conservative Party
thinking. The report found that incentives to work and earn more had
strengthened since 1979 but they have weakened since 2000, the period
during which tax credits were introduced. It
said:</p><ul><a name="06102324000116"></a>&#147;Overall, reforms
under the Conservatives acted to strengthen average work incentives
whereas Labour&#146;s reforms to date have weakened financial work
incentives on average; since 1999 tax and benefit changes have
increased the average effective marginal tax rate by almost 3
percentage points&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102324000072"></a>We
have discussed the effective marginal tax rates today. For the best
paid workers in the land, such as the Minister, it is 41 per cent. As
the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and my noble friend Lord Trenchard have
pointed out, more than 2 million workers stand to lose more than half
of any increase and 160,000 would keep only 10p in the pound. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pointed out, this is the toxic effect of
the combination of tax, national insurance, tax credits, council tax
benefit, housing benefit and any other benefits that have a withdrawal
rate. The plain fact is that means-tested benefits, which is what tax
credits are, weaken work incentives. The UK has the worst poverty trap
in the OECD for moving from part-time to full-time work.</p><p><a name="06102324000073"></a>I do not
dispute&#151;I could not&#151;that many families have benefited
from the introduction of tax credits alongside part-time and low-paid
work. But if effective marginal tax rates are too high, this effect
will not encourage those families to progress further into reduced 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1070"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1070</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dependence on benefits by working more hours or otherwise seeking higher
pay. Instead, they become trapped in benefit dependence at a higher
level of income than before&#151;a new form of poverty trap. This
dynamic will, over time, tend to produce higher levels of benefit
dependence than before because the incentive to escape benefit
dependency is too weak. The cost to the public purse, currently over
&#163;15 billion a year for tax credits alone, will remain
high.</p><p><a name="06102324000074"></a>The second claim is that
tax credits have reduced the tax burden on low- to middle-income
families. One of the features of the tax system in this country is that
income is taxed at relatively low levels and that fiscal drag,
especially engineered by the current Chancellor by holding allowances
down below the rate of earnings growth, has ensured that many more
people come within the fiscal net. That has been a feature of the past
10 years. So it might well be true to say that some low- to
middle-income families now pay less tax, but that rather begs the
question whether they should, in a rational system, have been paying
tax in the first place. It certainly begs the question whether there
should be two parallel systems&#151;to collect tax and to pay tax
credits&#151;if the effect is only to churn income between the
two.</p><p><a name="06102324000075"></a>The claim to reduce the tax
burden on low- to middle-income families sits very uneasily with the
fact that, in practice, child tax credits are given up to income levels
of &#163;56,000 and, if the &#163;25,000 disregard is added, up to
income levels of well beyond
&#163;80,000.</p><p><a name="06102324000076"></a>The third claim
is of a dramatic reduction in child poverty. Let me be clear: we
applaud reductions in child poverty, and I am not going to talk this
evening about the Government missing their own targets. The tax credit
system has certainly directed further resources to families with
children, thereby helping to reduce poverty. But the Joseph
Rowntree/IFS report highlights the fact that while increasing the child
element of the child tax credit has had the direct effect of reducing
child poverty, it can have the indirect effect of increasing poverty by
weakening the incentives of parents to work, thereby taking themselves
out of poverty eventually.</p><p><a name="06102324000077"></a>Since
the children of families in which parents do not work are themselves
more likely to be workless and benefit dependent, it may simply be that
the reduction in child poverty through tax credits hardwires benefit
dependency into the system. I am reminded of Mr Alan Milburn&#146;s
conclusion earlier this year in another place that, in the past
decade,</p><ul><a name="06102324000120"></a>&#147;poverty has
become more entrenched&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
Commons, 28/3/06; col.
710.]</ul><p><a name="06102324000078"></a>It is not the aims of
tax credits about which we have concerns; it is whether they are the
best method of dealing with the problems that exist in our society. I
have outlined some of those doubts, but they are reinforced by the way
in which tax credits have been implemented, as my noble friend Lord
Northbrook so excellently laid out this evening. I should like to read
out a brief summary of the charge sheet. They are expensive to operate,
costing, I believe, more than &#163;500 million a year. My noble
friend Lord Trenchard asked the Minister that question, and if I have
that figure wrong, I look forward to being corrected when 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord responds. The way in which tax credits have been
implemented has caused genuine hardship to very many families, at the
extreme requiring some to rely on food parcels from the Salvation Army
just to survive the chaos of implementation. The system has been poorly
implemented in the way that it has opened itself up to major fraud via
the online portal and the operation of wholly inadequate helplines for
much of the period. Tax credits are so badly designed that nearly 2
million overpayments and 1 million underpayments occur each
year.</p><p><a name="06102324000079"></a>I said
at the outset that I would want to see how the Chancellor&#146;s own
project of tax credits could shed light on what kind of Prime Minister
he would be. If the experience of the tax credit scheme were anything
to go by, it would indicate that ambitious aims are not matched by
effective delivery. That is true whether effectiveness is measured at
the level of practical implementation or at the level of achieving
good, long-term outcomes. It does not bode well for the
country.</p><h5><a name="06102324000127"></a>7.55
pm</h5><p><a name="06102324000080"></a><b><a name="61023-0012.htm_spnew182"></a><a name="06102324000138"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Northbrook, for initiating this debate and all noble Lords
who have spoken. I have had posed to me this evening far more questions
than I could possibly answer if I had an hour in which to speak, but I
will do my best.</p><p><a name="06102324000081"></a>Tax credits
help support 20 million people&#151;6 million families and
just over 10 million children. They have made a significant difference
to the well-being of families and individuals across Britain. The
take-up of tax credits is substantially higher than in any previous
system of income-related financial support for in-work families who
most need it. In the first year of tax credits, 93 per cent of families
on incomes below &#163;10,000 claimed their entitlement. That should
be compared with a take-up rate of 50 per cent for the early
years of family income supplement, 57 per cent for family credit and,
at best, 65 per cent for working families tax credit. Take-up is around
80 per cent across the board and 93 per cent for those most in
need.</p><p><a name="06102324000082"></a>I reiterate that tax
credits have delivered three major goals. They have improved incentives
to work; they have reduced tax burdens for low-to-middle-income
families; and they have dramatically reduced child poverty. Tax credits
in the context of our wider economic stability have contributed since
the spring of 1997 to an increase of more than 2 million in the number
of people in work, with long-term unemployment reduced by some
450,000.</p><p><a name="06102324000083"></a>Tax
credits have reduced the tax burden. The latest OECD study shows a
large fall in the tax burden for low-to-middle-income families as a
result of tax credits. The burden on a single-earner couple with two
children earning &#163;21,000 a year has fallen from more
than 17 per cent of gross earnings in 1997 to 9.8 per cent in
2004. That is the lowest rate of any G7 country. In the UK, a
single-earner family with two children can now earn just under two
thirds of the average wage before it starts to pay any net tax. Tax
credits have helped 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensure that the number of families with children paying no net tax has
risen from under 2.5 million in 1998 to more than 3 million this year.
They have made a major contribution to reducing child poverty, with
700,000 children lifted out of relative poverty since 1997. More than
1.8 million fewer children are in absolute low-income families than in
1997 on a before-housing-costs basis. I believe that that is an
achievement that we would all applaud. My noble friend Lord Giddens
made another important point about tax credits. He said that they
delivered support in a way which is
non-stigmatising.</p><p><a name="06102324000084"></a>The
introduction of tax credits has been a huge undertaking for HMRC. It is
the biggest single change to the welfare state since the Beveridge
reforms. Problems with the IT system in the early days created
difficulties, but HMRC has made significant progress. There is,
however, more to be done. Last May, the Paymaster General set out a
series of administrative measures designed to reduce the risk of
errors, to clarify communications with tax credit recipients and to
improve procedures for recovering overpayments. Since then, significant
progress has been made in each of these areas. Building on the progress
so far, major software releases were successfully implemented last
November and this April, delivering real improvements in operational
performance, not to mention in the service to
claimants.</p><p><a name="06102324000085"></a>Since
the introduction of tax credits, HMRC has worked closely with the
voluntary and community sector to improve its service to claimants. For
example, responding to feedback from the voluntary and community
sectors, it has revised award notices to include a clearer summary of
what will be paid and, for the first time, an explanation of how this
has been calculated. HMRC has been working with the voluntary and
community sector also to make claimants aware of their entitlement to
tax credits; for example, with the tax credits take-up resource pack,
which was provided by citizens advice but funded by HMRC. Building on
the progress made on administration in Pre-Budget Report 2005, the
Government announced a package of further improvements to the tax
credits system.</p><p><a name="06102324000086"></a>This struck a
balance between providing more certainty and stability for families,
particularly those on lower incomes, and maintaining the flexibility to
respond to changes in income and family
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102324000087"></a>A number of noble
Lords touched on the issue of end-year adjustments, which are
inevitably an integral part of a flexible financial support system.
Payments are based on household incomes which can, of course, change
during the course of the year. Payments are therefore subject to
adjustment during the course of the year and, if necessary, at the end
of the year once these changes in incomes are
known.</p><p><a name="06102324000088"></a>National statistics show
that year-end adjustments leading to an overpayment have fallen by
one-fifth from 2003-04 to 2004-05. Improved performance of the tax
credits system has meant that fewer overpayments are now caused by IT
or administrative error. The statistic of 97.75 per cent accuracy in
processing and calculating awards was quoted by my noble friend Lady
Hollis. HMRC expects to recover the majority of the money overpaid,
except where 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there has been a mistake by HMRC and it is not reasonable to expect the
claimant to have noticed the
error.</p><p><a name="06102324000089"></a>The national statistics
relate to 2004-05, and so do not show the impact of measures announced
at the time of the 2005 Pre-Budget Report to give greater certainty to
families while maintaining flexibility to respond to changing
circumstances. Once these come fully into effect the level of year-end
adjustments are expected to fall by a further third in future years.
Eliminating the need for adjustments altogether would require a move to
a fixed system in which eligibility was based on the previous year's
income and circumstances&#151;a system where, as a result,
flexibility would be diminished. This flexibility to respond to
changing circumstances is a key part of the system, especially in
today&#146;s modern labour market where in any single year 3 million
people change jobs and 200,000 men and women who move into new or
better jobs see their family income rise by more than
&#163;10,000.</p><p><a name="06102324000090"></a>Noble Lords
raised a number of questions. The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, pressed
me on a whole raft of questions relating to the Treasury Select
Committee report, and I hope that he will forgive me if I do not deal
with all of those in detail. The Government have not responded formally
to that report but will do so shortly, and perhaps we might have
another debate in due course when those responses have been made
formally.</p><p><a name="06102324000091"></a>I
was asked about overpayment awards for 2004-05. The amount currently
calculated is &#163;1.8 billion. The figures for 2005-06 are not yet
available as the claims have not yet been
finalised.</p><p><a name="06102324000092"></a>On our confidence
about the costings relating to the &#163;25,000 disregard, we have
two years&#146; data on from 2003-04 and the 2004-05 overpayments,
which help us to a better estimate of the costs involved. I refer the
noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, to the letter written to the Public
Accounts Committee, which sets out some of the background to
that.</p><p><a name="06102324000093"></a>The noble Lord asked, too,
about the causes of overpayment. The main causes are income rises,
families overestimating income falls, provisional payments being made
on out-of-date information and delays in reporting changes of
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102324000094"></a>On the issue of
error and fraud, figures published on 11 July gave HMRC&#146;s
estimate of error and fraud in the tax credits system for 2003-04,
which was of course several years ago. The information on organised
fraud shows that HMRC successfully stopped the majority of claims
identified as being submitted by organised fraudsters. Some &#163;409
million of fraudulent claims have been prevented, and there is no
evidence of new major organised frauds comparable to those involving
organisations such as DWP and Network Rail, which were reported to the
House in January. It is planned to increase the number of compliance
staff by
190.</p><p><a name="06102324000095"></a>My noble
friend Lady Hollis raised the issue of the large family premium. The
Government recognise that children in large families are at a
disproportionate risk of being poor. The 2004 child poverty review set
out a long-term aspiration to improve the financial support 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>available to large families. The introduction and increase in the per
child element of the child tax credit has disproportionately benefited
larger families and, compared to 1998-99, the risk of poverty has
fallen by 33 per cent for large families compared to 23 per cent
overall. Nevertheless we will continue to consider options to go
further, including the introduction of large family unlimited tax
credits, along with equalising child benefits, as others have
suggested, and increasing the child element.</p><p><a name="06102324000096"></a>I am afraid I do not
have any good news about the position on financial support for
grandparents. I think my noble friend is aware of the situation. It is
one thing where there are formal childcare arrangements in place, but
it is difficult for a Government to involve themselves in
commercialising arrangements within families. It is important to
differentiate between situations where the Government are paying, such
as the carer&#146;s allowance, and those where you would be
encouraging payments between family members. There would be
difficulties if it were judged that grandparents were not felt able to
fully undertake their responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06102324000097"></a>The issue of regional differences is an
interesting one. I think it has been considered recently in relation to
the minimum wage. The Government felt it was not the right way to go.
Marginal tax rates, which a number of noble Lords raised, are high but
effective marginal rates of over 70 per cent have fallen by half a
million since 1997.</p><p><a name="06102324000098"></a>I admire
the ingenuity of the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, on the dividend
tax credit. Forgive me if I do not rehearse the debates we have had on
that before, but I am sure we will have ample opportunities to do so in
the future. The cost of administering the system was &#163;467
million in 2005-06, which must be something like 0.25 pence in the
pound.</p><p><a name="06102324000099"></a>The
noble Viscount made reference, as did others, to the Tax Commission,
chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. We would say that transferable
tax allowance is an untargeted measure that is of most benefit to those
on higher incomes. Indeed, policies have increased the personal
allowance by &#163;7,185 by abolishing the 10p starting rate, which,
it was suggested, would cost &#163;4.6 billion. An increase in the
personal allowance disproportionately benefits the better-off on higher
marginal tax rates and is therefore regressive. Changes to tax
allowances cannot reduce tax liability below zero and therefore fail to
support the poorest. The combined effect of the new higher income tax
allowance, the proposed abolition of the 10p starting rate, the new 20p
basic rate and the abolition of tax credits for hard-working families
higher up the income scale would mean that of the poorest quarter of
households only one-third would see any benefit from the package and
two-thirds would not get a penny, while every single household in the
wealthiest quarter would benefit. We simply do not see that as the
right way to go.</p><p><a name="06102324000100"></a>My noble
friend Lord Giddens raised issues arising from the Joseph Rowntree
report, which suggests a basic rate of income tax of 37 per cent to pay
for changes to the system. If anything, we would say the tax system
they have designed is very much like the 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>current system except with higher rates, and we have a manifesto
commitment not to raise basic or higher rates of income tax.</p><p><a name="06102324000101"></a>We have touched upon issues of year-end
adjustments. I quote again the figure that each year at least 200,000
men and women move into new and better jobs and see their family income
rise by more than &#163;10,000. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, in
particular, talked about the IFS report. In response I say: look at the
evidence. Employment, which my noble friend Lord Giddens touched on, is
at record levels, with 28 million people in work. The UK&#146;s
employment rate is the highest of the G7 economies bar the US and
Canada. Since 1997, New Deal programmes, which are part of the
strategy, have helped reduce long-term youth unemployment and long-term
unemployment by over two-thirds. Working tax credit provides financial
support on top of earnings and, together with the national minimum
wage, helps to improve work incentives and relieve in-work poverty.
Lone parent employment has risen by 11.3 percentage points to 56.6 per
cent, the highest on record. There are now over 1 million lone parents
in work, over 300,000 more than in 1997.</p>

number of points on marginal tax-rate issues and on the
Chancellor&#146;s approach to those matters. I have no doubt that a
Chancellor who is about tackling poverty and improving incentives to
work and who wishes to reduce tax burdens for low-to middle-income
families would make an excellent Prime Minister, as I am sure that he
will.</p><p><a name="06102324000103"></a>I have
run out of time. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for not having
dealt with all the points that have been raised. I conclude by saying
that tax credits and economic stability have helped to increase the
number of people in work by more than 2 million since spring 1997.
Since 1997, long-term unemployment has reduced by 450,000. Tax credits
have improved work incentives, reduced the tax burden on low-to
middle-income families and helped to reduce child poverty dramatically.
Of course, we should remain vigilant to the administrative challenges
that these bold measures create, but we should celebrate the outcome of
the policy and the substantial improvement it has made to the lives of
many.</p><ul><ul><ul>House adjourned at ten

improvement. It must be remembered that effective management of
high-risk offenders, as a discipline, is still relatively in its
infancy. There is continuous development and the standards and good
practice of tomorrow, achieved through experience and research, are
likely to be different from today&#146;s. The challenge therefore is
not only to match current practice with what we know, but to respond
rapidly to new learning.</p><p><a name="06102313000016"></a>The
individual agencies have responded with major national initiatives to
improve the assessment and management of MAPPA offenders and these,
together with local actions, are reflected in the MAPPA business plans
which appear with the annual reports for the first time this
year.</p><p><a name="06102313000017"></a>The offences committed by
those offenders qualifying for management within MAPPA make an enormous
impact, principally upon the victims but also upon the wider public
consciousness. They raise questions about how the risks presented by
such offenders are assessed and then how it is possible to manage those
risks once the offender returns to the community. While we can never
eliminate risk entirely, we are all entitled to expect that everything
that can be done is being done to prevent these offenders
reoffending.</p><p><a name="06102313000018"></a>Even among those
qualifying for MAPPA, the majority are managed within ordinary agency
arrangements. While no incidence of further offending can ever be
acceptable, it is a tribute to the

active MAPPA management are charged with a further serious offence
while so managed. I commend these annual reports because they detail
the work that goes on day in, day out, in cases which generally do not
make the headlines, because of the skill and commitment of the agencies
involved in protecting the public, including the key work to prevent
offending against previous
victims.</p><p><a name="06102313000019"></a>Copies of every area

noted the still deteriorating situation in Darfur and committed to
continuing to provide support to the African Union mission in Sudan.
Commissioner Michel reported on his visit to Sudan with the Commission
president and their meetings with President Bashir. The Foreign
Secretary briefed partners on the visit by my right honourable friend
the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr
Hilary Benn) on 16 October: the situation was critical and we had to

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Tony Blair) has made the
following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06102313000053"></a>The informal meeting of EU Heads of State
or Government on 20 October followed up the 2005 Hampton Court summit
in addressing a range of issues that are central to the question of how
Europe responds to the challenge of
globalisation.</p><p><a name="06102313000054"></a>There was a
constructive discussion of the EU's external energy relations,
particularly our relationship with Russia. There was unity on the need
to build a close and legally binding partnership based on mutual,
long-term benefits based on the principles defined in the Energy
charter treaty and the declaration agreed at the G8 summit in St
Petersburg in July this year. These principles include market-based
rules, market opening, and transparency and reliability across the
whole of the energy relationship. The EU will shortly start
negotiations with Russia on a new comprehensive agreement to replace
the10 year-old partnership and co-operation agreement. It was
agreed that these principles should form the core of any new
agreement.</p><p><a name="06102313000055"></a>We shall also
continue to develop our relations with other producer and transit
countries around the EU, and we agreed on the need to extend the
internal energy market principles of open, transparent markets to our
neighbourhood.</p><p><a name="06102313000056"></a>It was also
agreed that the EU must show strong leadership in combating climate
change. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands and my right honourable
friend the Prime Minister (Mr Blair) wrote to their colleagues about
this ahead of the meeting. A copy has been placed in the Library of the
House. They stressed the need to act now to avoid catastrophic

and with the media after the meeting, emphasised the Commission's
intention to act on the climate change agenda, and highlighted the
Commission's energy efficiency proposals as the first stage in
this.</p><p><a name="06102313000057"></a>Migration was also
discussed. Illegal immigration is an issue that concerns the whole EU.
We agreed on the importance of well functioning border controls and
gave our full support to the European Border Management Agency. It was
stressed that co-operation with Africa and other countries of origin
and transit is essential.</p><p><a name="06102313000058"></a>My
right honourable friend the Prime Minister raised the desperate
situation in Sudan. The conflict has led to 2 million displaced
persons. He emphasised, to general agreement, the need to keep up the
pressure from the EU on the Sudanese Government to cease military
action, allow UN peacekeepers into the country, and reopen talks with
non-signatories to the Darfur peace
agreement.</p><p><a name="06102313000059"></a>Finally, innovation
policy was discussed&#151;how best to develop it as a source of
European growth. The Commission's intention to prepare a comprehensive
strategy on intellectual property rights in 2007 was welcomed.
Enhancing the co-operation between the private and public sectors is
also essential. European technology platforms and joint technology
initiatives were cited as excellent examples of public/private
partnerships. A proposal to create a European institute of technology
was also discussed, and looked forward to further consideration in the
Council.</p><p><a name="06102313000060"></a>The presidency invited
President Putin to join the EU Heads of State or Government for dinner.
Energy was one of the main topics. The presidency reiterated the
conclusions that we had reached earlier. For his part, President Putin
stated his conviction that energy co-operation should be based on
principles of predictability of the energy markets and the mutual
dependence of suppliers and
consumers.</p><p><a name="06102313000061"></a>The EU and President
Putin agreed to enhance our co-operation on international matters such
as Iran, North Korea and the Middle East peace
process.</p><p><a name="06102313000062"></a>The EU also emphasised
the need for a full investigation of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya,
and for those responsible to be brought to
justice.</p><p><a name="06102313000063"></a>The EU expressed its
concerns at the increased tension between Georgia and the Russian

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and
Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</b> My right
honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions
(Margaret Hodge) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102313000065"></a>In
his Statement to Parliament of 28 February 2006, my predecessor, Alun
Michael, launched a consultation on future structural funds spending in
the UK. The consultation invited comments on three issues: the draft
national strategic reference framework 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS99"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column WS99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for future UK structural funds programmes; the Government's approach to
distributing the UK's structural funds allocations under the new
competitiveness objective; and administrative arrangements for
delivering the funds during the next budgetary
cycle.</p><p><a name="06102313000066"></a>I am today publishing the
Government's response to the consultation exercise and the UK's
national strategic reference framework for structural funds programmes
during the 2007-13 period and these will be placed in the Library of
the House. These documents set out the strategy for future structural
funds spending across the UK, the allocations of funding for
future programmes, and the administrative arrangements for delivering
the programmes.</p><p><a name="06102313000067"></a>Under the new EU
regulations for the structural funds, each member state must draw up a
national strategic reference framework establishing its broad
priorities for future structural funds spending. The DTI has developed
the UK's national framework in close collaboration with other
government departments responsible for the structural funds, the
Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland
Administration and the Government of Gibraltar. The strategy
establishes three high-level priorities for future programmes:
enterprise and innovation, skills and employment, and environmental and
community sustainability.</p><p><a name="06102313000068"></a>The
national framework also makes a firm commitment to use the structural
funds to support ethnic minorities. It requires all programmes to take
account of the needs of ethnic minorities when determining priorities
and in the development of individual projects. In particular, they
should take account of the difficulties that certain ethnic minorities
face in accessing the labour market and the low levels of employment,
skills and entrepreneurship suffered by certain ethnic-minority
groups.</p><p><a name="06102313000069"></a>As explained in the
response to the consultation, the Government have decided that the UK's
mainstream competitiveness funding should be divided equally between
the European regional development fund (for regional development) and
the European Social Fund (for promoting employment) at the UK level. As
phasing-in competitiveness regions, South Yorkshire and Merseyside are
a special case. The Government have therefore decided to allocate 60
per cent of the phasing-in competitiveness funds for South Yorkshire
and Merseyside to the ERDF and 40 per cent to the
ESF.</p><p><a name="06102313000070"></a>The Government have decided
to allocate ERDF competitiveness funding between the UK's
competitiveness regions by reference to population, GVA and levels of
innovation, enterprise and skills. The Government have also applied a
cap and safety net to limit the change in each region's proportion of
funding in comparison with 2000-06. This will protect regions from
particularly heavy reductions in their proportion of
funding.</p><p><a name="06102313000071"></a>The Government have
decided to allocate ESF competitiveness funding between the UK's
competitiveness regions by reference to numbers of workless people,
numbers of working-age people with no qualifications, and numbers of
working-age people 



<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS100"></a><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column WS100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with low qualifications. Again, we have applied a cap and safety net to
limit the change in each region's proportion of funding in comparison
with 2000-06.</p><p><a name="06102313000072"></a>The UK will face a
50 per cent reduction in total structural funds allocations for 2007-13
in comparison with the current period, reflecting our strong economic
performance and the need to focus funding on the poorer new member
states. This means that most regions will, inevitably, suffer a
significant reduction in funding. However, the Government's approach
will ensure that funding is allocated fairly between the UK's
competitiveness regions on the basis of objective evidence of economic
need. It will also ensure that the allocation of funding supports our
domestic priorities for regional development and
employment.</p><p><a name="06102313000073"></a>England will receive
a total of &#8364;4.2 billion<sup>1</sup> or&#8364;91 per
capita in competitiveness funding. Within England, the funds will be
focused on the six underperforming regions, which will receive
&#8364;121 per capita on average, or 73 per cent of England's share of
the funds. The richer English regions will receive lower allocations,
reflecting their stronger economic position, but allowing them to
tackle pockets of deprivation. For example, the three regions of the
greater south-east will receive on average &#8364;54 per capita.
Cornwall will also receive &#8364;579 million of convergence funding,
agreed at the EU level.</p><p><a name="06102313000074"></a>Scotland
will receive a total of &#8364;573 million or &#8364;122 per capita
in competitiveness funding for 2007-13. It will also receive
&#8364;157 million in phasing-out convergence funding for the
Highlands and Islands. Wales will receive a total of &#8364;121
million or &#8364;114 per capita in competitiveness funding for
2007-13. It will also receive &#8364;1.8 billion in convergence
funding for west Wales and the valleys. Northern Ireland will receive a
total of &#8364;419 million or &#8364;248 per capita in
competitiveness funding for
2007-13.</p><p><a name="06102313000075"></a>The new arrangements
for distributing competitiveness funding are a radical departure from
the approach used in 2000-06. We now have the opportunity to put in
place an objective methodology based on sound economic criteria. The
change to a new system inevitably modifies each region's proportion of
the funds in comparison with the current period. However, the use of a
cap and safety net limits the change in each region's proportion of
receipts, ensuring that no region faces a much steeper cliff-edge than
others, and facilitating the transition from higher levels of funding
in the current period.</p><p><a name="06102313000076"></a>The
response to the consultation explains in more detail the Government's
methodologies for allocating the funding. The indicative allocations
for each of the UK's competitiveness programmes are set out in an
annexe to the national framework. The European Commission must agree
the allocations under the new structural funds
regulations.</p><p><a name="06102313000077"></a>Finally, the
response to the consultation and the national framework set out the
broad arrangements for delivering the funds in the 2007-13 period. In
England, the RDAs will take a leading role in delivering regional ERDF
programmes, working in partnership with local stakeholders.
Meanwhile,

retirement. The first element of the service, the provision of online
state pension forecasts, was delivered, on schedule, in 2004. The
remaining elements of the service were due for delivery in
2006.</p><p><a name="06102313000086"></a>Earlier this year, the
Government proposed fundamental reforms in our White Paper, <I>Security
in Retirement</I>, to both the state and private pension systems. In
the light of these proposals and their inevitable impact on future
pension provision, we carried out a detailed evaluation of whether the
planner, as developed, could provide people with accurate information
during this period of reform. The evaluation determined that delivering
accurate online information about state pensions would become
increasingly difficult given the uncertainty about the exact shape of
future pension provision. This would also add considerable further cost
and complexity. We have therefore decided to suspend further
development of the web-based planner.</p><p><a name="06102313000087"></a>We remain committed to the principle of
providing people with information to support retirement planning but
are clear that this now needs to be set in the context of the wider
White Paper developments.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06102313000010"></a>Refugees</h3><p><a name="06102313000088"></a><b><a name="61023-wms0002.htm_spnew191"></a><a name="06102313000099"></a>The

Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan Ryan) has made
the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102313000089"></a>The Home Office
published a consultation document on 23 October to seek views on its
proposals for an overhaul of the way in which government-funded refugee
integration services are delivered. The proposals centre on the
establishment of a core set of services to be made available to
refugees across England (it will be for the devolved Administrations to
decide on the case for analogous changes for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland). The proposals move considerably beyond those set out
in the current national integration strategy, <I>Integration
Matters</I>, and the Government will issue a revised policy statement
on the future of refugee integration services as an outcome of the
consultation process. The Government have invited comments on their
proposals by Christmas, and a copy of the consultation paper has been
placed in the
Libraries.</p><p><a name="06102313000090"></a>Along
with the changes in their refugee integration strategy, the Government
will reform the arrangements for regular consultation on matters
affecting refugees as an integral part of their wider approach to
stakeholder management in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.
The National Refugee Integration Forum will therefore be wound up,
although arrangements will be made to continue project work undertaken
under its auspices. The Government wish to place on record their
gratitude to those who have served on the forum since its inception in
2000.</p>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional

agreement does not vary significantly from the previous agreement. The
key difference is that it has a Third-Pillar legal base rather than a
First-Pillar one, in order to comply with the European Court of Justice
ruling of 30 May. Unlike a First-Pillar agreement, a Third-Pillar
agreement requires domestic implementation measures, and this has been
done through a direction under the Air Navigation Order requiring
airlines to provide PNR data. At present, the US authorities pull
information from airlines&#146; reservation systems, but it is
intended to move to a system in which airlines push data to the US as
soon as possible.</p><p><a name="06102318000046"></a>Like the 2004
agreement, the new agreement is due to expire in late 2007. The new
agreement refers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) instead
of US Customs and Border Protection (which is part of the DHS) to
reflect changes to the internal structure of the US Administration.
However, the DHS is giving the same undertakings in support of the new
agreement as the CBP gave in relation to the 2004 agreement. In a
letter to the EU, the DHS has set out how it interprets those
undertakings in the light of developments, including new US
legislation, since 2004.</p><p><a name="06102318000047"></a>The
changes to the agreement do not materially affect the level of data
protection for individuals. Although the data protection directive does
not apply to the processing of personal data in the Third Pillar, the

one.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06102318000005"></a>Banks:

extensive discussions have been held with all interested parties,

Sainsbury of Turville:</b> Since the start of
operations at Dounreay in the 1950s, the site has been authorised at
various times to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous radioactivity to
the environment. It has been a condition of these authorisations that
the environmental impact is measured and reported. This has shown that
the elevated levels of radioactivity found in the environment around
Dounreay as a result of authorised disposals are well below the limits
for public exposure to radioactivity. In addition, the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency carries out its own monitoring, and the
results are published annually in the <I>Radioactivity in Food and the
Environment</I> series.</p><p><a name="06102318000078"></a>It is
now known that particulate in the form of fragments of irradiated
nuclear fuel entered the liquid effluent disposal system at Dounreay
and was discharged to sea. Seabed surveys have detected these
fragments, or particles, in the sediment near the old discharge point.
The action of the sea on the sediment is thought to transport the
particles, which have been detected during routine monitoring of the
beaches at Sandside and Dunnet and the foreshore at Dounreay. UKAEA, on
behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, is consulting on
feasible options for remediation. The outcome of this consultation is
expected to help identify environmentally acceptable methods of dealing
with this issue. UKAEA believes it will not be practicable to retrieve
all particles released from the site, but the offshore source should be
substantially reduced. Any particles detected on local beaches as a
result of regular inspections are
removed.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06102318000015"></a>Family

a four-year scientific research project (due to report in 2007), in
collaboration with Cornwall County Council, the Environment Agency and
others, into the biological control of Japanese knotweed. The study
will undertake the necessary research to establish whether biological
control is a feasible method for the long-term, sustainable management
of Japanese knotweed in the
UK.</p><p><a name="06102318000128"></a>The research has looked at a
wide range of possible agents from the home range of Japan and has so
far been narrowed down to two potential host-specific agents&#151;a
fungus and an insect. Host range testing for these two agents continues
to ensure they will attack only Japanese
knotweed.</p><p><a name="06102318000129"></a>The cost of a national
eradication programme using current techniques is prohibitively
expensive, estimated in the Defra review of non-native species policy
to be in the region of &#163;1.56 billion. However, the Environment
Agency takes local measures if flood defences are compromised (using
risk assessment and local knowledge). In Cornwall, a more proactive
programme has been implemented by the agency in association with the

the possibility of fully paperless prescriptions. In addition, patients
will be able to nominate a particular dispenser where their

note that there is no element of compulsion associated with the
nomination of a dispenser. Patients do not have to nominate and are
free to revoke or change an existing nomination at any time. To
maximise patient convenience, patients who choose to nominate will be
