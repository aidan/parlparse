<a name="60130-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Energy Policy</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Why, when the energy review has been set up to consider, among other matters, the case for new nuclear build, they support the proposal by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd to sell Westinghouse Electric Company.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government considered the matter carefully before agreeing to the sale process and do not believe that ownership of Westinghouse is likely to have any bearing on the UK&#039;s ability to satisfy any future nuclear energy needs. The energy review team continues to be content with this position. If the private sector brought forward proposals to build new nuclear, an important element of the proposals would be the choice of new plant design. In that choice, it would be important that the private sector were not influenced by whether a given technology was government-owned or not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   That may be all very well, my Lords, but does the Minister not appreciate the irony of the fact that on the very day that the Government published their energy review, which clearly enhances the prospects of new nuclear build in this country, BNFL finally signed the agreement to sell Westinghouse to Toshiba? The apparent conflict between those two policies is bizarre. I understand that it is now a done deal, apart from regulatory <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

requirements, so one has to move on. Will the noble Lord give an undertaking that the Government will deploy some of the proceeds from the sale to BNFL to enhance and develop this country&#039;s remaining nuclear capability, perhaps by financing BNFL&#039;s research arm, Nexia Solutions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the decision to sell was taken last June. The noble Lord has alighted on a coincidence with regard to dates, but the policy has been generated over many months. I cannot give the undertaking that he wants with regard to the proceeds. He will recognise that we are undertaking a further review of the country&#039;s energy requirements and that the issue of new nuclear build is within that framework; likewise, therefore, the question of any government resources that might be devoted to that end, although it will be market forces that determine a great deal of the build for Britain&#039;s energy needs in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister say whether the low-carbon solutions that are looked for in the energy White Paper will include nuclear? On what basis will the Government make the calculation of how many grammes of carbon dioxide are produced per kilowatt hour? Bill Coley, from British Energy, has stated that new-build nuclear, which I believe must be based on the designs that we are discussing, produces five grammes of carbon dioxide. Are the Government happy with that figure and have they consulted the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority on whether that is a realistic amount of carbon, considering the long tail that nuclear decommissioning will cost in carbon?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord has not so much asked a question but advocated his usual viewpoint in his usual penetrative way. However, he will not get past my defences. The carbon code and the future of British energy policy are related to the review that we are undertaking. I assure him that, of course, we shall pursue all the factors necessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for us to meet the energy needs of the nation over the foreseeable decades, while at the same time meeting all international requirements on carbon emissions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister give us some comfort on this point? If we are to lose the only nuclear-build organisation in this country&#151;it has been sold, it is a done deal and there are all sorts of reasons for and against it&#151;will some of the proceeds, as my noble friend said, be directed towards maintaining a group of people of the highest possible calibre so that, if we go down the nuclear route, at least we shall have an in-house team in this country able to assess the pros and cons of various other options and market forces? The last thing we need is to find ourselves with no capability or general knowledge on nuclear matters. Perhaps the Minister could reconsider his comment and bring to the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that that would be very worth while in the long term.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that I need to bring this to the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I reassure the noble Baroness that the Government already devote resources and are committed to the continuance of the resources that sustain our nuclear skills. There is no question that ever since the first energy White Paper, we have recognised the necessity, as we said at the time, to keep the nuclear option open. That necessitated investment in skills, and we shall continue with such investment. Therefore, I assure the noble Baroness that, if additional skills and additional people are identified as being required in this area, a proper request on Government would be to enhance the skills of the nation, and we shall meet that if that event occurs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that there was not unanimity on the decision in the industry? Why does he think that certain people opposed it as vigorously as they did?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is an interesting exercise in conjecture. I take it that some people would have contended that the continuance of a public stake in this area might bring additional rewards to taxpayers, which is an important concern. Of course, they would also need to take it into account that this is a high-risk industry; the bids that the nuclear industry may make for a potential new-build in China are high-risk. My noble friend might think that the public ought not to sustain such a high-risk strategy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bridges: </b>   My Lords, in the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, wrote to me some days ago explaining the Government&#039;s desire to withdraw from the association with Westinghouse, he gave as a reason the matter to which the Minister has just referred; namely, the apparent wish of Westinghouse to sell nuclear reactors to China. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

letter concluded that the Minister felt it was too much to expose us to that particular risk. It might have been risky, but it was also an opportunity, and now we have lost it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is the noble Lord&#039;s considered judgment. I am at least consoled by the fact that my previous answer is consistent with what my noble friend had written to the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. I can only say that my noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Turville is right: there was a balance to be struck on these factors. The Government have come down on one side, and I note that the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, may be on the other.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60130-01_time0"></a><h5>2.44 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Renton </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether it is the case, as recently reported, that 20 per cent of all births in England and Wales in 2004 were to foreign-born mothers.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, that is broadly accurate. Birth registrations gave a total of 124,563 live births occurring in 2004 to mothers who were born outside the United Kingdom, out of a total of 639,721 live births. That has been presented as 19.5 per cent in published statistics and, in turn, rounded to 20 per cent in press reporting. What is not reported is that 7 per cent of that 19.5 per cent have a British-born father and that the 19.5 per cent figure includes those who were born abroad but have United Kingdom citizenship. The figure also ignores the valuable and disproportionately positive contribution that migrants make to the United Kingdom economy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60130-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, should we not bear it in mind that in most countries where British mothers give birth to children, those children do not have British nationality but will have the nationality of the country where they were born? On the other hand, is it not highly desirable that children born here of foreign parents should not have British nationality because it would give them a status in this country that they may never be here to enjoy again? I know that this is a big subject but, bearing in mind the complexities of it, would the Government consider a change in the law?
</p>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure where the noble Lord is coming from on this, but I rather gather that he is unhappy with the statistics that I presented to your Lordships&#039; House. We are happy with our interpretation of the law, and we accept that it is a complex matter of interpretation. But I am overwhelmingly left with the impression that migration to the United Kingdom is a force for good and a very positive thing, not just economically but in diversity and in what generations of migrants have brought to the culture and quality of life of this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew1"></a><b> The Countess of Mar: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the Immigration Appeal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Tribunal. My understanding is that a child born of foreign-born parents in this country, where those parents have not had British nationality conferred on them, remains a child of the nation of the parents&#039; birth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, in most circumstances that is absolutely right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, my children were born here at a time when they would be British although they had two Australian parents. I clearly recall when your Lordships&#039; House changed the law on that. If my children were born here tomorrow, they would not be British. As I understand it, they must have one British parent. It used to be that if you overflew the country and dropped off the plane to have the baby, it would be British because it was born here, but that was changed some time ago.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am enormously grateful to the noble Baroness for her interpretation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that successive census data have confirmed that a large number of foreign-born people who enter this country, particularly women of child-bearing age, are economically active? In a country that is ageing so rapidly and where the birth rate has dropped, should we not be celebrating the fact that these people are contributing so fundamentally to economic development?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am inevitably drawn to agreeing with the noble Lord. The 2001 figures show that migrants generated 10 per cent of GDP despite accounting for 8 per cent of the working-age population. In 2003&#150;04, migrants accounted for 10 per cent of government tax receipts but 8.1 per cent of government expenditure. Obviously those are broad figures that no doubt include a lot of other detail within them, but the case is inescapable. Migrants to our country not only help the economy but contribute an enormous amount to British life. We should celebrate that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister able to say whether the Government think that the figure of 20 per cent is too great, too little, or exactly right and in accordance with a policy that they have pursued?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it is a statistic. I have tried to be as factual with your Lordships&#039; House as I can. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, is at variance with his party leader on the subject of migration. Perhaps he is trying to make a political point. It may be worth reminding him that David Cameron recently said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;Over the centuries, Britain has profited immeasurably from the skills and vitality brought to these islands by immigrants from all over the world&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60130-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Perhaps the noble Lord does not agree with him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that I can remember an occasion when I have gone up to the parents of a newborn child and said, &quot;Can you tell me where you are from?&quot;. That is not the first question that you ask a parent; you usually congratulate them on having a child. As we are so proud of our nation&#039;s history, because it is so diverse and has given us such strength, not just in recent years but over hundreds of years, we really ought to be very proud of that diversity and strength. Let us stop knocking it in the way that some people do by innuendo.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right. Not for the first time, he has hit the nail on the head.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord answer a question and give a straight answer instead of asking me a question?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I think that from time to time I am entitled to pose a question to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. However, I have given a straight statistical answer, and I am happy with that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, have not the questions put by noble Lords indicated that it would be far better if there were a degree of flexibility in this matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, there is, and I think that we have benefited from that. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s contribution.

<a name="60130-02_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Railway Franchises</h3>
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60130-02_time0"></a><h5>2.51 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether the past performance of a prospective franchisee plays any part in the evaluation of bids for railway franchises.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the track record of applicants forms part of the assessment process at the pre-qualification stage. Later, at the invitation-to-tender stage, the selection of the successful franchisee is based on the bid submitted. Each bid is subject to a full evaluation. That includes an assessment of how robust and deliverable the bidders&#039; plans are for punctuality, management of crowding and customer service.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, he is saying that it is all based on what franchisees, or prospective franchisees, promise to do in future. Many benefits are back-loaded into the franchise, so that they come in years seven, eight, nine and 10. Would it not be much better to take into account the actual performance of franchisees? In respect of those who give good service while they have a franchise&#151;all recent bidders have had franchises&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_7"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should there not be a system where, if they exceed performance in one year, they effectively get a gold star and, when they fail, as I fear they often do, they get a black mark? Then, when they bid again, it would be obvious to the public who had done what they said they would do, so that that was not some black art carried out by consultants in the Department for Transport that obfuscates the whole process.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it is not a black art but a complicated process, as the noble Lord will recognise. He says that it ought to be wrong for bidders not to have their past performance evaluated if they already hold a franchise. He stresses that it is impossible for that to happen, but I assure him that past performance is taken into account.
</p>

<a name="60130-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>On the final submission of bids, when what is judged is the ability to deliver against strict and clear criteria, he is right. The companies that succeed do so because they produce the best bids. Perhaps he has in mind a case in which a franchise was won by a group when its performance might not have been too good. When, for instance, First Group bid for the First Great Western franchise, there were clear factors at play, especially with the crucial line from Reading to Paddington, which significantly affected that group&#039;s capacity to perform there. We are, however, satisfied with its commitment to future investment and performance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House what plans the Department for Transport has for reducing the rail network and, in particular, the number of small railway lines throughout the country? If not, can he explain why the department has today published a consultation document to create guidance on the process for closing railway lines?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we are concerned that debates about any closures should take place with the fullest possible public participation, because we know that people value railways. Some services offered at present receive little patronage and need to be evaluated. But those services are in the franchise bids made by companies, and I assure the noble Lord that, as the House would expect, we make judgments on franchise bids on the basis of fare-paying passengers&#039; expectations and proper contributions and on the basis of what is fair to the taxpayer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60130-02_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us why, after eight years, the Government are now looking at reducing railway services in rural areas, bearing it mind that in every one of the past eight years rail usage has gone up? On a network that is far smaller than it was in the days before Beeching, there are now more passengers using the railways. Why are the Government now trying to shut railways down?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60130-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government are committed to enhancing rail passenger numbers. We all know that rail is the most environmentally friendly form of public transport and that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_8"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expansion in recent years is a reflection of investment and strategies for which the Government take considerable credit. But even in circumstances where on some of our main lines we are seeing a substantial increase in the service, in other areas the passenger service receives little patronage. The noble Lord may have seen that one stalwart individual travels every day as the only passenger on a train in a valiant attempt to keep that line open.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warnock: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest because I use a small line from Wiltshire to Paddington many days a week. Is the Minister aware that one is seldom asked to pay for a ticket on that train? If one were so inclined, one could frequently travel for free. Many commuters who use that train have a strong feeling that that is part of a deliberate policy so that the people who use the train cannot be counted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I think that I can disavow the notion that it is a deliberate policy. The noble Baroness may recognise that the difficulty may be that regular inspections on a line with a limited number of passengers might cost a great deal more than is received in revenue. That is part of the problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest. I had a great sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu listening to that exchange. Will the Minister accept that the key problem with rural railway lines is that they can never break even because passengers do not travel throughout the 24 hours, yet the infrastructure for safety and everything else remains incredibly expensive? The Government should wake up and realise that in most countries that have this problem, the governments openly have a subsidy to that section for social benefit so that everybody knows where they are.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord speaks with a great knowledge of the challenges to the railways. However, I think that he will recognise that of course there is cross-subsidy of some rural routes, for obvious reasons. First, they link up with main lines, which is essential for passengers who use main line services. Secondly, they are of conspicuous social benefit in areas where the local rural economy might face considerable decline if the service was withdrawn. Of course that is an element in the calculation. I have already mentioned at least one case where it is fairly obvious that decisions have to be taken, which is at the point where the train company&#039;s other fare-paying passengers are subsidising very limited traffic, as is sometimes the case.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, the human rights situation in Zimbabwe remains appalling. The resolution by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#039; Rights reflects growing international consensus that Zimbabwe is suffering from chronic misgovernance. Although the African Union has not yet endorsed the resolution, its Khartoum summit in January gave Zimbabwe three months to respond. We encourage African leaders to press Mugabe. We urge the Government of Zimbabwe to end their abuse of human rights and to restore the rule of law and democratic governance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60130-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Blaker: </b>   My Lords, as the report by the commission was one of the first on Zimbabwe put forward by an African intergovernmental or interparliamentary body, is it not significant that it contained such frank criticism of the brutal and ruinous regime of Mr Mugabe? Is it not therefore a pity that the ministerial meeting did not decide to study it more seriously and pass a resolution supporting the report of the commission? As the African Union was founded recently to replace the Organisation of African Unity, which was wound up because it suffered discredit, is it not important that the African Union should act robustly on a report of this kind so as to escape suffering a fate similar to that of the OAU?
</p>

<a name="60130-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it would be wholly desirable for the African Union to take&#151;even if it paused for three months to give Zimbabwe the opportunity to respond&#151;the fullest opportunity to ensure that its critical analysis is upheld. I agree with the noble Lord in those terms. It is fair to say that we have seen several useful initiatives of a kind that we have not seen before. President Obasanjo and President Konare sent a delegation which, unfortunately, Mugabe would not receive. Kofi Annan sent Anna Tibaijuka, who wrote an outstanding and damning report, and recently the South Africans have, for the first time, placed political conditions on any further financial help, which thus far they have declined to provide. We are seeing the beginning of the tide turning in a different direction, and I am happy that that has happened.

<a name="60130-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am concerned about the confusion which may have arisen at the beginning of proceedings this afternoon. I am looking at the list of today&#039;s groupings provided by the Government Whips&#039; Office, which clearly states that the first amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, has not been debated. Perhaps my recollection of debates over the past two days is somewhat hazy, but I had anticipated that the noble Baroness would introduce the amendment. I am a little concerned that we have not had the opportunity perhaps to welcome the amendment and for the House to understand what it is all about.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The confusion is most unfortunate. It may well be that we will have to return to the matter on Third Reading. Government Amendment No. 65 was the subject of a difficult debate on Schedule 9, and it is not a matter that we wish simply to pass over.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Amendment No.66A will be moved by my noble friend Lady Seccombe.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60130-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe </b>   moved Amendment No. 66A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>Page 16, line 38, leave out paragraph (a).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 66A would remove subsection (2)(a) from Clause 18. As the Explanatory Notes inform us, Clause 18 sets out that there may be no requirement on individuals by organisations to produce an ID card as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_12"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the only acceptable proof of identity before a move to compulsion, other than in the circumstances set out in subsection (2). The Explanatory Notes go on to explain that the exceptions in subsection (2) include where there is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;a specific requirement for a check on an individual&#039;s ID card or against the Register under Clause 15&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>that is, the power to make public services conditional on ID checks&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;or in accordance with provisions under another enactment; where the organisation allows for reasonable alternative methods of proving identity; or when it is compulsory for the individual to register&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Paragraph (a) refers specifically to Clause 15 and provisions that may be made by another enactment. My fear is that this subsection could potentially catch individuals, private organisations and/or private businesses. It is one thing to require that access to all government-funded public services needs an ID check but quite another to impose on privately run businesses the need for compulsory ID checks, using this system, and, in turn, all the currently unknown costs that will go with that&#151;for example, the cost of readers or of making requests to the system. In addition to imposing such costs, the subsection removes a degree of choice that businesses should themselves make regarding ID checks. I know that the Government disagree with this, but we should not be a nanny state.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The particular open-ended reference to the phrase, &quot;in accordance with provisions made by order under any other enactment&quot; is very far-reaching. No doubt the Minister will argue the need for flexibility. But what is to stop future enactments in theory from compelling something silly like a fairground owner checking everyone&#039;s ID card to make sure they are old enough to have a go on specific rides, be they too old or too young? Will the Minister offer to see what changes can be made to the legislation to ensure that none of the above will occur? What assurances can she give that subsection (2)(a) will not be used in this manner? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60130-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I should like to make a comment about the proposed removal of the subsection by reference to Clause 15, to which it relates. I was hoping for some assistance from the noble Baroness to confirm what I think was said at an earlier stage, although I cannot remember which day it was as there have been so many. Clause 15 is important because it makes public services susceptible to being conditional upon someone having an ID card. Subsection (2) refers to the fact that regulations cannot, however, make that requirement effective with regard to public services provided free. The classic case would be someone getting National Health Service treatment. Clause 15(2) makes it clear that a citizen cannot be forced to have an ID card before he or she gets National Health Service treatment. The reference in subsection (2) is to public services provided free of charge.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The point was raised before, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I raise it again. I am sure that we all want to be quite sure, at virtually the last <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_13"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

gasp, that, in considering this amendment and Clause 18, we do not inadvertently get wrong what may happen under Clause 15.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>My question for the noble Baroness is this. If one goes to the chemist with a prescription from one&#039;s doctor, unless one is in one of the exempt categories&#151;OAP, child, or certain other conditions&#151;one pays a prescription charge. That would fall outside the exemption in Clause 15(2), which is only where the service is provided free. I apologise to the House for what must seem a complicated question, but unfortunately it is a complicated Bill and sometimes one cannot get around the complexities. I am anxious to ensure that we do not leave the Bill in a state where a hullaballoo arises hereafter because people who have to pay whatever the prescription charge is are suddenly told that they are not within the exemption to Clause 15(2) and asked to produce an ID card. That is the question that arises from the amendment, seeing that it will have a direct impact on Clause 15. I would be most grateful if the Minister would give us some light on the matter. I mentioned it to her officials earlier in the day, so I hope that it will not be such a bombshell as it might sound.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60130-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is right in saying that government Amendment No. 65, which would have led into the conversation we have just had on Clause 15, would bite on this. For the House&#039;s clarification it might help if I explained how Amendment No. 65 fits in with the response I intend to make on her Amendment No. 66A, because the two go together. In doing so, I hope to deal also with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, on free prescriptions, not least because he is talking about Amendment No. 33, which he moved on the first day of Report on 16 January. If that suits the House it might get us back to where we should be.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>My Amendment No. 65, which was passed by the House, has the effect of preventing the information contained in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, which is the audit log, from being provided under Clause 17 to public service providers. Noble Lords will recall that Clause 17 enables the provision of information to public service providers for the purpose of verifying the identity of a person who has applied for a service. As my amendment has been accepted, the audit log will no longer be provided under Clause 17. The amendment I moved and that was passed was tabled in response to the concerns raised in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. I was grateful to him for raising that issue so that we could deal with it.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a> The noble Lord asked about prescription charges. The amendment that he would have moved would have given the individuals the option of whether an audit log should be kept of those occasions when an identity card is checked with the individual&#039;s consent under Clause 14. For the reasons that I gave earlier, which were recorded in <i>Hansard</i>, we believed that it would be wrong to allow the possibility of individuals deciding for themselves whether some checks against <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_14"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the register should be logged. If that happened, there would be no record to use in cases of complaint and it would mean that a fraudster trying to use someone else&#039;s card could insist that no record was kept of that transaction.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>At the same time, we thought again about the second part of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. I hope that we have made it plain that it is no part of our intention to compel people to produce ID cards for prescriptions that are free. I know that there was a debate about whether we would need to do so for ophthalmic and other issues&#151;dental treatment was mentioned on the previous occasion&#151;and I want to make it clear that it is not our intention so to do. We do not think that the noble Lord&#039;s concern is well founded.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I turn to the noble Baroness&#039;s Amendment No. 66A, which would remove paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Clause 18. As noble Lords know, Clause 18 is designed to provide a general safeguard that in most circumstances people will not be forced to use an identity card to prove identity in advance of compulsion. Thus, in line with Clause 18(1), it would not be possible for, let us say, a bank or building to require a customer to produce an identity card as the only acceptable proof of identity in advance of compulsion. The safeguard in Clause 18 still allows an identity card to be one of the methods accepted for proving identity, provided that a reasonable alternative method of establishing identity is also allowed. It would no longer apply once it is compulsory to register and to hold an identity card.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The words in Clause 18(2)(a) that would be removed by Amendment No. 66A serve a purpose. This subsection would allow a requirement to be imposed to produce an identity card in advance of compulsion if it had been imposed under Clause 15, which deals with making public services conditional on the production of an identity card or any other enactment. However, any regulations under Clause 15 would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so Parliament would have the opportunity to debate and agree them. Moreover, as provided in Clause 15(2), any such regulation in advance of compulsion could not apply to the payment of benefits or to the delivery of any free public service. I hope that gives as clear a reassurance as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, would wish for.
</p>

<a name="60130-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We should not rule out in future providing that identity cards be required to be produced if that is a condition of other legislation, which also would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Accordingly, we believe that the drafting of Clause 18 is satisfactory. I therefore invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60130-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, I thank her for her explanation of all these matters; they are scarcely simple. However, the language of Clause 15 is different from the policy that the Minister enunciated. She was clear about the policy, and I accept what she said. The problem is that the wording of Clause 15(2) does not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_15"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

follow the policy; it is wider. If one supposes different circumstances, a different Minister and a different government, then one does not have the reassurance that the Minister gave to the House. The classic case of a prescription for which a member of the public has to pay something would not fall within the exemption in Clause 15(2). Will the Minister think again about this before Third Reading, because it is an important point? It is not good law to include in a Bill a provision that is dependent on policy. Will the Minister come back with some wording that takes account of my point?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60130-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am certainly happy to look at the matter, but, as I said earlier, the safeguard exists through the affirmative resolution procedure. Any regulations for monitoring this situation would have to come before both Houses for debate and therefore be agreed in the way in which we have clearly set out.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I have also given the assurance that it is not our intention that the provision should operate in a way that would make an identity card compulsory for free prescriptions. I have given assurances also in relation to those other matters.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I hope that I have explained why we are unable to accept the wording of Amendment No. 66A of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, which was spoken to so eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. I recognise that she was trying to find a safeguard against the enforced use of identity checks in advance of compulsion. She made that clear in the way in which she explained the amendment. In giving further consideration to Clause 18 safeguards, we are investigating the possibility that a loophole exists. The provisions in Clause 18 are designed to ensure that organisations cannot insist on production of an identity card as exclusive means of proving identity prior to compulsion unless, as we have already discussed, this has been required by an affirmative order under the required identity checks provisions for public services in Clauses 15 to 17 or in accordance with another enactment.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>However, the clause does not deal expressly with the possibility of an organisation requiring a person to obtain a copy of their record held on the national identity register by exercising their subject access rights under the Data Protection Act or by making use of the proposed online facility to check one&#039;s own records. We should properly look at and tighten up all those things. However, if we do what I have indicated for Clause 18, I do not think that the noble Lord&#039;s concern about Clause 15will be a problem, particularly bearing in mind the assurance I have given. Should we conclude that there is a need to tighten matters, we will return with a government amendment to Clause 18 at Third Reading. My officials will be in touch with the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office to alert it to the precise details of the amendment before it is tabled. I hope that by looking at Clause 18 we will be able to close any gaps that remain and that the noble Lord would be content with what we now have in Clause 15, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_16"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

limited as it is by the tightening that we hope to be able to do on Clause 18. I think that that meets the needs both of the noble Baroness and of the noble Lord as well.

(c)   requiring the persons referred to in paragraph (b) to act reasonably and proportionately in providing information under sections 19 to 22&quot;

<p><a name="st_73"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I can move this amendment very quickly. Clause 23, to which it refers, sets out the rules for providing information&#151;that is, information from the national register&#151;without an individual&#039;s consent. Therefore it is a singularly important clause. In subsection (2), the Secretary of State may make regulations to make those requirements of public authorities and of persons authorised by public authorities. My feeling is that the inclusion of the amendment would be extremely helpful at an important part of the Bill and would give clear guidance both to the many officials who have to construe this remarkably complex piece of law hereafter and, even more important, to the citizen who has to resort to it.

<a name="60130-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>On many occasions in these debates, many of us have said that this is a citizens&#039; Bill. It is not one of those technical measures that one knows will be resorted to only by professionals; potentially it will affect tens of millions of our fellow citizens. My amendment would require the persons referred to earlier in the subsection&#151;that is, the public authorities&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;to act reasonably and proportionately in providing information under sections 19 to 22&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I am well aware that under the Human Rights Act there is an implied obligation in all circumstances, one can broadly say, for authorities&#151;that is, public bodies&#151;to act reasonably and proportionately. Therefore, it is legitimate for the Government to say in response to the amendment, &quot;This is superfluous. Just trot along to the Human Rights Act and look at the relevant subsections and Bob&#039;s your uncle&quot;. Well, Bob is not my uncle because I do not know anything about the Human Rights Act. I do not want to be cast in that direction, but I do want to have at a hugely important point in the Bill a simple, clear statement that anyone who is asked to provide information under this clause&#151;it can be highly sensitive information&#151;will have to act reasonably and proportionately.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The other point that I draw to the attention of the House is that I have sought to avoid this obligation falling on the shoulders of the Secretary of State by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

way in which I have worded the amendment. It would simply give the Secretary of State the power to make provisions requiring the persons who are to provide information to act in this way. So it cannot be argued that the state bureaucracy is unduly trammelled because at every turn it will have to make an individual judgment on every single individual provision of information. That will fall to the authority providing information to determine, as provided for by the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I hope that the Government will&#151;as they do on occasions, it must be said&#151;provide words which are implied by the Humans Rights Act or, indeed, that they will put in provisions that are not strictly necessary at all. Perhaps I may refer the noble Baroness, who is already looking sceptically in my direction, to Clause 16(6). It is a completely superfluous and unnecessary subsection but, as it is to give an impression which the Government assiduously try to implant in the public mind, it is included, although it is completely superfluous in literal, necessary terms.
</p>

<a name="60130-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I hope very much that the Government will&#151;as, to be fair, they have done on one or two occasions&#151;make an amendment to the Bill that has regard to the fact that it is Joe Bloggs who is affected by these provisions. We do not want to drive every person to a lawyer in order that they may understand where they stand, and the same goes for civil servants at all levels. I beg to move.

<a name="60130-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I support the intentions behind the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, although I do not support the way in which he is going about it. I certainly agree with him that it is important that there is clarity in the Bill with regard to proportionality. Here, we are trying to get at the issue of good governance and to obtain from the Government reassurance that that will be pursued in these matters.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is saying. It is implied here that one has the protection of the Human Rights Act, but that is an onerous way for the ordinary citizen to obtain redress. The question to which we are trying to get an answer from the Minister is as follows. If the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is not made, what other clear, simple mode of redress is there for the citizen who believes that those who acted on behalf of the Secretary of State had acted unreasonably and disproportionately? I am trying to pick my words carefully here. The reason why I do not support the noble Lord 100 per cent is that, as noble Lords will notice from the Marshalled List, my noble friend Lord Northesk has tabled a later amendment which approaches the issue from a different angle.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is saying&#151;that is why he has not put an immediate duty on the Secretary of State. When we are looking at a system that is being introduced by the Secretary of State, and there is an essential issue of good governance, it should be for the Secretary of State to take responsibility. I look forward to my noble friend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_19"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Northesk&#039;s introduction of his amendment, when we may, perhaps, be able to explore those issues in greater detail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60130-06_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, it seems to me that the amendment is merely trying to define that the civil servants who will be giving out the information should act in a particular way; it leaves the Secretary of State to lay that down quite clearly. As good civil servants do not act <i>ultra vires</i>, and will tend always to follow the letter of what is laid down, I would have thought the amendment to be very sensible. It leaves flexibility, while at the same time making it quite clear that there is a duty for a civil servant to act in a particular way. I cannot see the disadvantage in this. A lot of people are very worried about some of the things that could be done under this Bill, and it seems to me that this is a very neat way of trying to allay some fears.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60130-06_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, pre-shadowed my response to why this is unnecessary. I have to tell the noble Lord that Bob is my grandfather, my uncle, my brother and my nephew, so as far as that is concerned, we think that the Human Rights Act is enough here. I also need to say to the noble Lord, with reference to Clause 16, that it is not superfluous or meaningless: it imposes a duty to consult where regulations are made under that clause and there is an existing statutory duty under other relevant powers. It has some real function and is therefore significantly different from the measure suggested by the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I understand what the noble Lady, Baroness Anelay of St Johns, says about agreeing in essence; we too think it absolutely essential that there should be proper and good governance in this matter. The proposition that the powers under Clauses 19 to 22 must be exercised &quot;reasonably and proportionately&quot; derives from the Secretary of State&#039;s public law duties and the provisions of the Human Rights Act. As ever, we are most reluctant to reiterate obligations that already apply. The clear implication of doing so would be that without such wording it would be lawful for a power to be exercised unreasonably or disproportionately. I am sure that that is not what the noble Lord intends.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Aside from that, we unfortunately consider the noble Lord&#039;s amendment to be flawed, in that it seeks to place the duty to act reasonably and proportionately directly upon civil servants. As noble Lords are aware, under the aspect of our constitution often referred to as the Carltona principle, the Secretary of State remains accountable for the actions of his officials. Those actions are, constitutionally speaking, his actions, albeit carried out by his civil servants. If information were provided under Clauses 19 to 22 in an unreasonable or disproportionate way, it would be the Secretary of State who would answer for it.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Nevertheless, I recognise the sentiment behind the noble Lord&#039;s amendment; we are acutely aware that those individuals whose job it will be to provide <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

information under Clauses 19 to 22 will have to be well trained in order to ensure that such disclosures are within the terms of legislation&#151;that they are reasonable and proportionate. There will be guidance and procedures to this effect. The power to provide information without consent does not mean that the information must or should be provided whenever it is requested. We will make sure that procedures not only govern the way in which a request for information is made, but ensure that the information is provided only when the request is reasonable and proportionate.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I would, therefore, ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. I very much take on board what the noble Lady says about making procedures clear, simple and available to members of the public. Indeed, we have sought to do that with administrative law generally, making it easier for people to challenge and, by the way in which they challenge, enabling us to be sure that they are taking full opportunity to do so.

<a name="60130-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am thankful for the Minister&#039;s remarks. To clear up one legal point that she raised, I beg to differ with her on the Carltona decision and the reference in the relevant clause to civil servants. I do not believe that &quot;persons&quot; here refers to individual civil servants. It is a reference to the persons referred to in Clauses 19 to 22, which are authorities, not civil servants. But let us leave that little joust aside and get to the nub of the matter, which is that the Minister is sympathetic but unmoved by my desire to have this made plain in the Bill. I cannot at this stage do more than withdraw the amendment, but I shall speak to the Minister between stages, because I am terrier-like in my wish to make the Bill more sympathetic to the layman. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;(   )   The Secretary of State must not process sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (c. 29) in connection with an individual&#039;s entry in the Register without the consent of that individual.&quot;

<p><a name="st_81"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment seeks clarification from the Minister on an issue that I first raised in Committee on 16 November, in cols. 1175&#150;77; it was rather a long debate, as noble Lords can tell from the column references. I was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerned that an amendment made on Report in another place may have had unintended consequences and might allow sensitive personal data to be added to the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Clause 1(6) was added by the Government without debate, because the guillotine prevented it. It was added in good faith by the Government to meet objections that had been raised in another place by the Minister&#039;s honourable friends. Their concern and that of Members throughout the House was that the drafting of Clause 1 meant that the database could contain sensitive personal data. The main concern had been that medical and criminal records could be added to the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>After Committee, the Minister wrote to me to explain why the Government believed that their drafting of subsection (6) remains benign. But she admitted in that letter that there cannot be a complete exclusion of information tending to reveal sensitive personal data from the registrable facts at Clause 1(5) because a photograph or nationality may of itself tend to reveal such data as racial ethnic origin, which is covered by the Data Protection Act 1998. But she argued that that is information that everybody would expect to be on a register. That sounds like common sense, but she will understand that I remain a little uneasy about the position on sensitive data and, like the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, I believe that this is a Bill that changes the relationship between state and citizen so much that it is the duty of all of us to ensure that we get it as right as possible for the citizen.
</p>

<a name="60130-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The reason why I brought back this amendment, for clarification only, is that I believe that it will be consistent with the position that the Government have taken in the Minister&#039;s letter. It would simply ensure that the Secretary of State could not process sensitive personal data that were covered by Section 29 of the Data Protection Act 1998. Will the Minister give me a clear assurance that that is the position that the Government intend to adopt in the setting up and running of the national identity register? I hope that she will explain why she feels that it would not be better to have this in the Bill. I know that she will attempt to do so; let us see if she manages to persuade me. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60130-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I shall be very happy to seek to do so. The noble Baroness is right to refer to the content of the letter and the reasons we have set out. It is important just to run through what &quot;sensitive data&quot; means, because it emphasises why a photograph could arguably be sensitive data. I say &quot;arguably&quot; because people tend to fall on both sides of the argument. Some say that it is not sensitive data&#151;it is just a photograph; whereas others say that it is sensitive data. That is what causes us the difficulty.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Some noble Lords may not be familiar with the definition of &quot;sensitive data&quot;, so I shall remind the House what it is. It is the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject; his political opinions; his religious beliefs; whether he is a member of a trade union; his physical or mental health; his sexual life; the commission or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

alleged commission by him of any offence; any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to be committed by him, and the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>It is clear to those noble Lords who are now familiar with Schedule 1 to the Bill that the register will not contain substantive information falling within any of those categories. Moreover, any addition to the list of information in Schedule 1 would have to be consistent with the statutory purposes, which in effect rules out any possibility of adding, for example, medical or criminal records. However, as I have indicated, it is arguable that information that is in itself innocuous is in fact sensitive personal data within the DPA definition. For example, a photograph may reveal someone&#039;s racial origin or indicate a particular disability or religion, perhaps because they are wearing a capel, a turban or something of that sort.

</p>

<a name="60130-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>So one sees why the debate over photographs comes about. I am sure the noble Baroness is not seeking to prevent the provision of photographic information from the register without consent; for example, to the police under Clause 19(3)(b) for the detection of a crime, and that could quite possibly be the effect of amendment No. 74A. For the reasons I have given, I hope she will feel comfortable about withdrawing it. I understand perfectly why, in the normal way, the issues that would fall within &quot;sensitive data&quot; would be excluded. If there were not an argument about the photograph, I would have been happy with the amendment, but there is. There will be those who say the photograph clearly identifies a number of those issues, and that is our problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60130-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. As I explained, this was for clarification. Most people who have not been involved with every line and word of this Bill would have thought a photograph could not bring offence by bearing sensitive personal data, but people have written to me who are concerned that a photograph, as the Minister has just said, could reveal their religion, which might mean they would be discriminated against in certain circumstances. I entirely understand what she says with regard to why photographs must be included in this&#151;an identity card would not function effectively were they not. I appreciate that there is a crossover with the Data Protection Act, and there have been some complications as a result. I am grateful to her for making further clarification on the record, and I would not return to this on Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;FUNCTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN RESPECT OF DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

<br>
(1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 19 to 23, the Secretary of State has the following specific functions in respect of the disclosure of information&#151;


<br>
(a)   to draw up and disseminate to the persons and bodies to whom sections 11 and 19 to 23 apply, guidance as to the disclosure of information between and amongst themselves in a proportionate and necessary way;


<br>
(b)   to draw up and disseminate to the persons and bodies to whom sections 11 and 19 to 23 apply, guidance as to the circumstances in which it is appropriate for those persons and bodies to disclose information between and amongst themselves in a proportionate and necessary way;


<br>
(c)   to maintain under review the guidance set out in paragraphs (a) and (b).


<br>
(2)   In drawing up the guidance set out in subsection (1)(a) and (b), and in reviewing such guidance under subsection (1)(c), the Secretary of State shall consult&#151;


<br>
(a)   the National Identity Scheme Commissioner;


<br>
(b)   the Information Commissioner;


<br>
(c)   such other interested persons and bodies as the National Identity Scheme Commissioner sees fit.


<br>
(3)   The guidance under subsection (1)(a) and (b) shall in particular make provision as to&#151;


<br>
(a)   the nature of the information that must or may be disclosed;


<br>
(b)   procedures designed to ensure the proportionality and necessity of the process of information disclosure;


<br>
(c)   procedures designed to ensure the accuracy and security of information disclosed;


<br>
(d)   procedures designed to ensure, where appropriate, the co-ordination of the disclosure of information between and amongst relevant agencies and persons in a proportionate and necessary way;


<br>
(e)   procedures designed to guarantee, as appropriate, the rights of data subjects in respect of any information about them that may be disclosed;


<br>
(f)   procedures designed to govern the period for which it is appropriate that information should be disclosed and to ensure appropriate deletion of any information disclosed in compliance with the data protection principles.


<br>
(4)   This section applies to the persons and bodies identified in sections 11 and 19 to 23 and, as appropriate, any agencies, companies or individuals who may be contracted to work for them or to supply goods and services to them.


<br>
(5)   The Secretary of State may by regulations subject to affirmative resolution in each House of Parliament proscribe and penalise contravention of any guidance under this section as to collection, sharing, use, holding and disclosure of information.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_86"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, as your Lordships will be aware, we debated this somewhat late in the day in Committee. I hope, therefore, that I may be forgiven for returning to the issue today, although happily I need not weary the House with a detailed explanation of its purpose, which is straightforward: namely, to propose that the Secretary of State draw up statutory guidelines in respect of the information disclosure provisions of the Bill, with the intention that these be enforceable in law. I have been consistent in my pessimism about the Government accepting the amendment, on the basis&#151;and here I echo an earlier comment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;that it will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_24"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be argued it is unnecessary because the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act will apply to this legislation in any event. The Minister made that case in Committee. Indeed, when I sought to amend the Children Act 2004 in a similar way, my efforts were rebuffed for the same reason, although it is perhaps worth noting that at that time the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, replying for the Government, made the point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;We are clear that comprehensive statutory guidance is needed&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/7/04; col. 1431.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>That was buttressed in the 19th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which observed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;We welcome the Government&#039;s acceptance of the need for comprehensive statutory guidance on information sharing, in response to an amendment proposed by&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="60130-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>myself, and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. It may be somewhat presumptuous of me, but I infer from that that at least some elements of the legislative process have sympathy with my purpose here.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>That aside, revelations in respect of a number of related matters over the past few weeks have reinforced my conviction that some form of additional protection for the public in this area is essential. First, your Lordships will of course have noted the recent disclosure that some 24,000 young people aged between 10 and 18 are having their DNA profiles routinely stored, despite the fact that they have never been charged or cautioned for an offence. That is a matter that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, raised in a Starred Question last week. The structure of the Bill, as I have repeatedly argued, allows a great deal of cross-pollination between the national identity register and other government databases. It is entirely possible that the ID card scheme could in the future be used to cross-reference DNA data. Evidently, that flies in the face of the assertions that the Minister made on the point throughout our scrutiny of the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>We all understand that there are legitimate, perhaps even virtuous, arguments in favour of the utility of databases storing DNA profiles. However, it is essential that their establishment should not happen, as it were, by stealth, but should be subject to open and transparent parliamentary debate. Certainly this matter would seem to argue in favour of the new clause, the more so given that there have been indications that the Home Office may be in the process of reviewing its retention and deletion policy in this area.

As a result, from April this year, records of all criminal convictions and cautions, however minor, will remain on file pretty much indefinitely. Again, we can all accept and recognise the efficacy of using such data within databases for the prevention and detection of criminal and even terrorist activity.

data&#151;albeit &quot;available to police eyes only&quot;&#151;for 100 or so years and the fifth data protection principle, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>There is also the announcement from the Home Office Minister, Andy Burnham, that ID cards will,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;incorporate a &#039;contactless&#039; or &#039;proximity&#039; chip&quot;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>reliant on RFID&#151;radio frequency identification. The fact is that this technology can be and is used to track the location and movement of items in which it is embedded. ID cards would effectively come with a built-in facility permitting knowledge of the whereabouts of the holder for every second of every day. That is an especially pertinent issue regarding the security of the scheme. All those developments persuade me that, however persuasive the Minister may be in arguing the case, the comfort and security afforded by the Data Protection Act are far from adequate.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>In Committee, the Minister suggested that an argument against the new clause is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;what is lawful for [recipients of information] to do with it will depend on each recipient&#039;s own common law and statutory powers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/12/05; col. 1355.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>In other words, it will be difficult to codify the Bill&#039;s disclosure of information provisions because they stretch across such a wide variety of agencies. To my way of thinking, that makes it all the more necessary to do so. It is precisely because current arrangements for disclosure are such a mishmash that guidelines, statutorily based and enforceable in law, are unnecessary. Such a codification should reflect the different approaches adopted by different agencies, thereby creating greater transparency of the regime. Merely because such a task might be difficult should not in any way militate against it being done.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>In fact, the new clause buttresses a central recommendation of Sir Michael Bichard&#039;s inquiry into the Soham murders. Recommendation 8 of the report states that, in respect of police IT systems:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;A Code of Practice should be produced&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>which, in the words of Recommendation 9:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;must clearly set out the key principles of good information management (capture, review, retention, deletion and sharing), having regard to policing purposes, the rights of the individual and the law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The Home Office&#039;s progress report of last month identifies that the full set of guidance recommended by Sir Michael Bichard was available as of October last year. To that extent, the new clause&#151;in so far as it applies to Clauses 19 and 20&#151;is entirely consistent with the policy imperatives being pursued by the Home Office. Indeed, while it is idle to speculate, it is conceivable that much of the recent controversy about List 99 and the sex offender register might have been avoided had the new clause, or something like it, already been properly implemented. Dare I say it, but, viewed from this perspective, the Government should be minded to approach the amendment with a healthy measure of sympathy.

<a name="60130-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I add a few thoughts about this, in part reflecting some of the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, last week. The Home Office has announced, almost with pride, that 7 per cent of the UK population will have their DNA profiles stored in two years&#039; time, thereby reinforcing the UK&#039;s position as the world leader in the practice. For example, this compares with the EU average of 1.13 per cent, and 0.5 per cent in the United States.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Some 20 per cent of the total CCTV cameras deployed in the world are to be found in the UK. Under the current Administration, the UK population has become subject to greater level of state surveillance than almost anywhere else in the world. This necessarily begs the question of whether the rights and protections of our citizens in this area have kept pace with what some might be tempted to call the Government&#039;s infatuation with snooping. There are legitimate reasons for supposing that the powers of the Information Commissioner and associated legislation such as the Data Protection Act 1998 are proving ever more inadequate, as perhaps exemplified by the decision of the Information Tribunal to which I referred earlier.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>By the same token, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves that the Information Commissioner has had just cause in the past to bemoan an absence of appropriate enforcement powers. The new clause is therefore intended to offer some redress in this area.
</p>

<a name="60130-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>In conclusion, I repeat my assertion that the new clause or something like it is necessary to act as belt and braces to the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 1998, and to give both the national identity scheme and information commissioners adequately sharp teeth. As my noble friend Lord Crickhowell pointed out in Committee, it would go a long way towards mitigating many of the anxieties that many of us have about the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I suggested in one debate last week that we should look at the German legislation on data protection, which made it absolutely impossible for any government department to share data with anyone else, or for the butcher to pass on the names of customers. While sitting with a glass of wine or two and talking to my friends around the world over the weekend, for a bit of fun I tried to access the 22 countries who are members of the EEA&#151;those whose people are effectively allowed to travel at present into this country with an identity card. I sought to see whether I could harmonise the data on that identity card, and which countries had legislation which would mean approving the sort of legislation which we are introducing today. I had these sorts of comments, some from politicians and some from others; &quot;You cannot be serious!&quot;&#151;that was one&#151;or, &quot;You cannot be doing such a thing in a country with greater liberty than anyone else&quot;.

The discussion&#151;with some of a Lebanese nationality, or British; I use the word &quot;nationality&quot; guardedly&#151;went that they were worried about doing the wrong thing if they put up a CCTV camera to record information. Some cameras can record for nine months on a single disc, and we discussed who that information belonged to. Would the state have access to it, or would they? Where was the intellectual property?

<a name="60130-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, has tabled a practical amendment that gets to the heart of the principal area of concern about the Bill as a whole, which is how, and under what circumstances, sensitive information can be disclosed. As the noble Earl said in moving the amendment, given that we have a mishmash of provisions in the Bill&#151;that is no one&#039;s fault but just a function of a highly complex piece of legislation&#151;there is every reason why the Secretary of State should have the practical task of pulling it all together and putting out guidance. Guidance is guidance; it is not law. However, it would be extremely helpful to those who will have to work this huge, complex bundle of rights and obligations and to those citizens whose information is collected and disclosed. I should have thought that that is totally with the flow of what the Government have been saying all along and the messages and the policy assurances that the Minister has regularly given. I do not see that this amendment does anything but support&#151;in a sense, buttress&#151;all that. It will provide a single place in which civil servants, the public and public authorities can see set out comprehensively what disclosure means and the reasonable limits that should surround it.

It is very much with us, and will be with us a lot more when the Bill, and other Bills to come, are passed.

he had realised that eventually we were going to have a compulsory register and compulsory identification cards for every citizen in our land. I believe that he did not think that that could possibly apply in Britain. But, of course, here it is&#151;and it is applying.

<a name="60130-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The Minister has told us very often that the proposals in the Bill have the overwhelming support of the British public. I do not believe that is true. It may be that a focus group has come up with 72 per cent in favour, but I can assure her that the conversation on the buses&#151;I do not know whether she ever goes on the buses&#151;and my postbag tell me that there is a large opposition to this measure. The more people know about it and the more people begin to understand what is at stake, the less they like it. Indeed, Swindon Borough Council, I am glad to say, passed a resolution last week against the imposition of identity cards and an identity register.

<a name="60130-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>There is much that should concern us about the Bill.

Where it is right for information to be disclosed, we are all concerned to ensure that, for example, children in vulnerable situations are protected. But there is some confusion on these matters.

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans for asking the question that he did. I know it gently drifted away from the amendment but I hope the Minister will be able to respond to it. I listened to the same radio broadcast as the right reverend Prelate and it struck me then that the Home Secretary was taking a rather different stance from that which is being presented to us here. In front of us we have a Bill which is intended to link from the word go the passport to ID&#151;initially compulsorily&#151;when you apply for a new document. I tabled amendments at the Committee stage which probed the issue of how soon the driving licence would come in as the designated document.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>But this is the first time that the Home Secretary has mentioned in one breath the passport and in the next breath the Criminal Records Bureau, forgetting all the rest. That is a cause for concern and I understand exactly why the right reverend Prelate mentioned that against the background of the importance of volunteering. So, although he was drifting away from the amendment, it was an important point to make.

</p>

<a name="60130-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>To put the matter entirely beyond doubt, I am happy to tell your Lordships that the Government intend to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading to limit the registrable facts under Clause 1 to external characteristics, which is something that we debated long and hard when the matter was raised&#151;by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, in particular&#151;in relation to how to differentiate between internal and external characteristics. The issue of a future government was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk&#151;I am constantly being told that I am very benign&#151;as a way to undermine my argument. A future government would be prevented from adding DNA to the information that might be added to Schedule 1 by affirmative order. I hope that we can put the debate on DNA to bed. It will not be part of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I can tell the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, that it is not right to suggest that the provisions in the 2001 and 2003 Acts have been unmerited in any way. I hope that the noble Earl was present when I said that more than 3,000 cases have been identified as a result of that material, including rapes and murders. One that stands out in my mind is a 20 year-old offence of the rape and murder of a 14 year-old girl, which was discovered as a result of a minor offence being committed some 20 years later. We are not saying that DNA has not some significance, but DNA and ID cards should be separated.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Before continuing, I should mention the suggestion that the Secretary of State should issue the guidance. I confess to being a little surprised, given the trenchant criticisms of the Home Office during our debates on the Bill, that noble Lords would want my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, or his successors in title, to be responsible for guidance on information sharing to all public authorities. That is surely the function of the independent Information Commissioner and should be properly dealt with in that way.

</p>

<a name="60130-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>On the issue of contactless ID cards raised by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, I should make it clear that it is currently planned that an ID card will be valid for travel within the EEA. As a result it must comply with the standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Thus, all countries are considering this very same matter. Standards stipulate that a travel document, such as an ID card, will have to have a contactless or proximity chip. It will require the card to use radio frequencies to allow the card to be read at very short distances of approximately 0 to 2 cm from the reader. That is somewhat similar to the oyster card used on London transport. To prevent the information on such chips being read at a greater distance, the card will implement basic access control, which requires that the machine readable zone&#151;the MRZ&#151;printed on the face of the card is scanned and the information then used to unlock the read and request data from the chip.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>As with e-passports, which the UK Passport Service is beginning to issue from this year, an attempt to read the chip without using the information printed on the MRZ to unlock it will yield no data that can be used to identify an individual. The worry of the noble Earls, Lord Erroll and Lord Northesk, is not merited. The conspiracy theory that the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, seems to be promulgating about the style of tracking will not occur.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>As for CCTV cameras, I very much take on board the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon. It amplifies how many of the public want to have better protection and want the facility of CCTV cameras. Indeed, we know that they are extremely useful in the detection of crime, not only in relation to terrorists but in identifying recent criminal offenders. None of that bites on this.The noble Earl&#039;s amendment would require the Secretary of State to draw up and disseminate guidance to recipients of information from the register relating to disclosure of that information between and among them.


</p>

<a name="60130-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The noble Earl stressed the importance of data protection and we do not disagree with him. However, the amendment, notwithstanding the fact that it is supported by a number of noble Lords, is misguided. It seeks to give the Secretary of State a role which is more appropriately fulfilled by others, as I have already indicated. Guidance on onward disclosure would necessarily relate predominantly to the legal position. The extent to which, and the circumstances in which, onward disclosure of information by a person who would have received it under these clauses would be lawful would depend on the statutory or common law powers of that particular person and the application of various restrictions from the Human Rights Act through the Data Protection Act to common law duties of confidence. The noble Earl was right to remind your Lordships that I made those points when we last discussed this.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The police have powers which are different from those of the security agencies, which are in turn different from those of government departments. Recipients of information from the register will no doubt take advice from their respective legal advisers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_33"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on disclosure of information, wherever that information has derived from. It is not appropriate for the Secretary of State, in exercising his functions under the Bill, to be under an obligation to provide what would amount to detailed and tailor-made legal advice to a wide variety of people, all of whom are already getting that advice from its proper source. 
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Subsection (3) of the amendment provides that the guidance produced by the Secretary of State would in particular have to deal with matters such as the security of information and the period of retention. Those are exactly the kind of matters which are governed by the Data Protection Act. In so far as the noble Earl is proposing that guidance should be given in complying with the obligations which derive from the Act, I gently remind him of the primary duties of the Information Commissioner, which are set out in Section 51 of that Act. The first two subsections provide:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;(1)   It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to promote the following of good practice by data controllers and, in particular, so to perform his functions under this Act as to promote the observance of the requirements of this Act by data controllers.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>(2)   The Commissioner shall arrange for the dissemination in such form and manner as he considers appropriate of such information as it may appear to him expedient to give to the public about the operation of this Act, about good practice, and about other matters within the scope of his functions under this Act, and may give advice to any person as to any of those matters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Those are the commissioner&#039;s proper functions.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I take this opportunity to remind the House of some of the safeguards for which the Bill makes provision in relation to those to whom information may be provided from the register. Clause 24(2) requires the National Identity Scheme Commissioner to keep under review the arrangements made by those who can be provided with information from the register for obtaining, recording and using the information. Furthermore, as a result of government amendments, accreditation for organisations provided with information under Clauses 19 to 22, which are not specified in the Bill, will be compulsory. Finally, under Clause 26(2), the Intelligence Services Commissioner is empowered to keep under review the acquisition, storage and use by the intelligence services of information recorded in the national identity register as well as the provision of that information to any member of those services.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I hope that I have been able to persuade the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, and other noble Earls who have spoken, together with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, that to include this further obligation on my right honourable friend or his successors in title is not necessary. Advice on the circumstances in which disclosure would be lawful is that it really is not an appropriate matter for the Secretary of State. It would be tailor-made to each recipient, having regard to the statutory and common law regime surrounding the recipient.
</p>

<a name="60130-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>It is quite clear that it is better for the commissioners to do this job&#151;they are better placed to do it independently and thoroughly, with the appropriate rigour and vigour&#151;than it would be to ask my right <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

honourable friend the Home Secretary simply to duplicate all that work. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60130-10_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her response. I am also grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken, not least for the level of support that the amendment inspired. As others indicated and I sought to demonstrate in my introduction, my aim here has always been to offer assistance to the Government. I was particularly struck by the comments made by my noble friends Lady Anelay and Lord Crickhowell. They both correctly identified the utility of giving the public&#151;those on whom the ID cards scheme will primarily impact&#151;clear, concise and transparent information about their data. That can only engender better and greater acceptance of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="60130-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I hear, accept and understand the Minister&#039;s comments on DNA. In my introduction, I was content to reflect on the usefulness of it in the detection and prevention of crime. I will not be tempted down the route of explaining why virtually it is possible that the register may have access to DNA&#151;that would become too complicated and it would bore your Lordships to tears.
</p>

<a name="60130-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>With regard to RFID, I merely point out that the chips in biometric passports in Holland have already been forensically hacked from a distance much greater than a few centimetres and decrypted within a matter of hours. In other words, that technology is insecure and raises severe data protection issues. With regard to the Secretary of State&#039;s role, interestingly, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, used the reverse argument when we were debating the Children Act. She maintained that the Secretary of State should have responsibility in this area. I suggest that the Government cannot have it both ways depending on which piece of legislation is under consideration. Because my intent with the amendment was to assist the Government, more in weariness than anything else, I should test the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Clause 24 [<i>Appointment of National Identity Scheme Commissioner</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>   moved Amendment No. 76A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Page 21, line 24, leave out &quot;Secretary of State must&quot; and insert &quot;crown must, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, after that excitement, I beg to move this short amendment, which would make the Information Commissioner appointable by the Crown on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, rather than by the Secretary of State alone. In Committee, we discussed a number of amendments designed to give more independence to the commissioner in carrying on his or her work. Most of that work will be with regard to public authorities.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Indeed, in moving the amendment, I could do no better than to take over wholesale the arguments advanced by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, for resisting the previous amendment. Noble Lords may remember that the proposal of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, was for the Secretary of State to have responsibility for issuing guidance and so on. The noble Baroness said that that was monstrous, completely improper and unsuitable. She said that the commissioner should have those powers because much of the work is to be done by departments of government and therefore it would surely be more appropriate for the commissioner to have the powers. I say, &quot;Hear, hear&quot;. That is right in every particular, and apparently your Lordships agreed with the noble Baroness because they failed to approve the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The powers under the Bill relating to the commissioner are absolutely critical. It is plain&#151;is it not?&#151;that there is a great deal of anxiety in this place and in the country about the prospects of disclosure of information not following the lawful courses provided for by the Bill, leading to inadvertent disclosure of highly sensitive information. Indeed, it is fair to say that there is a great deal of anxiety about the Bill in all its aspects. While it is our duty to make the best of it, I believe that this modest amendment will give the commissioner a little more distance in terms of his or her relationship with the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>We have tabled a later amendment, which would require the commissioner to report to Parliament rather than to Parliament through the Secretary of State. I hope that, when we reach it, the amendment will be accepted or voted upon affirmatively. But, for the time being, Amendment No. 76A deals with the appointment of the commissioner. It is just worth mentioning that Clause 24(2)(a) describes the function of the commissioner as keeping under review,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_38"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;the arrangements for the time being maintained by the Secretary of State for the purposes of his functions under this Act&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>There is a great deal more of that type of obligation. As I said, it is another vivid example of how the relationship between the commissioner and the Secretary of State is apt to be extremely sensitive and important, and therefore it must be desirable to provide a little more distance and independence in relation to the appointment of the commissioner. With those few words, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, in the later group to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, referred I will be saying rather more about the important issue of independence and the need to have a strong and robust commissioner who, if necessary, can stand up to the pressures that may be placed on him. I must confess that I cannot recall whether, when I became chairman of the National Rivers Authority, I was appointed by the Crown, the Minister of Agriculture or the Secretary of State for the Environment. Certainly I was answerable to the last two but I think that my authority succeeded in being robustly independent.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I will have something to say on the later group, but now I will simply say that I believe that the principle being addressed in the amendment&#151;that the commissioner must be the strong protector of the citizen; again, I go back to using the word &quot;citizen&quot;&#151;is so important that anything we can do to support and strengthen it should be backed by the House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, I strongly support the principle, which has just been elegantly announced.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I add my support to this amendment, moved with such commendable brevity. I think the important point is that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, is proposing a method by which the authority of the Secretary of State would not be compromised, but the position and independence of the commissioner would be enhanced. As my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, that is exactly what we are trying to achieve as well as ensuring that there is a champion for the citizen throughout this procedure&#151;somebody who will be able to stand up to the Secretary of State. The Minister may, I think as a result of some murmuring I heard from him a moment ago, be about to ask whether it really matters, because people will not particularly understand the difference. I see the Minister shaking his head; I am glad that he is not going to take that tack. The importance will be seen by Parliament and by the person appointed as commissioner. If they are appointed by the Crown, it gives them that &quot;stand back&quot; position, that extra position of authority and impartiality, which would be welcome.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, and other noble Lords have very adequately set out what they seek to achieve. Noble Lords will be aware that there are a variety of different statutory commissioners, some appointed by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_39"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Her Majesty, some by the Prime Minister and some by the Secretary of State. Among the commissioners appointed by Her Majesty, there are those, including Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectors of Constabulary and Her Majesty&#039;s Inspector of Prisons, who nevertheless report to the Secretary of State. There is then the example of the Information Commissioner, who is appointed by Her Majesty by Letters Patent, who is a corporation sole, and who reports directly to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>We take the view that it is appropriate for the National Identity Scheme Commissioner to be appointed by the Secretary of State. I accept the point that the commissioner might be seen as more independent if he were a Crown appointment, but I am not aware that, for instance, the Immigration Services Commissioner is regarded as biased because he is appointed by the Secretary of State, nor that the Intelligence Services Commissioner is compromised for being appointed by the Prime Minister.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>To a degree&#151;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, will accept this point&#151;this is a presentational issue more than anything else. There are no differences in terms of powers and there is little that can be achieved by the amendment, as the noble Lord himself put it. All it would achieve is the perception of a little more distance. The noble Lord is not, I think, advocating complete independence, such as the Information Commissioner has. The Information Commissioner has the power to serve enforcement and information notices on data controllers, Secretary of State data controllers included. He also has the power to bring prosecutions. Total independence is therefore entirely appropriate in such a case. The National Identity Scheme Commissioner, by contrast, has a rather different role&#151;that of reviewing and reporting&#151;so that both the Secretary of State and Parliament benefit from his overseeing the scheme.
</p>

<a name="60130-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I am unconvinced that a case has been made for the National Identity Scheme Commissioner to be appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, as opposed to being simply appointed by the Secretary of State. I can reassure the noble Lords that the appointment of the National Identity Scheme Commissioner will follow the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments rules and, importantly, its code of practice, as well as Home Office guidance on public appointments by Ministers. I understand the desire for robust independence. We think that the legislation, as it is set out, achieves exactly that, so I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, the Minister accepted that this might relate to perception. Is it not the Government&#039;s view that that can be vital&#151;hence the decision to move the entirety of the Lords of Appeal out of this House?
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60130-11_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, that is a neat point. However, as I said in addressing the issue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_40"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 40</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

precisely when considering the point on commissioners, it would be commonly assumed that the Immigration Services Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Commissioners, as well as other commissioners who are appointed in the same or a similar way to the National Identity Scheme Commissioner do not have their independence compromised. One could fairly argue that they are more than prepared to take a robust and independent line.

<a name="60130-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I am also grateful for that Exocet from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, which was more than a neat point. I thought that it went to the heart of the debate&#151;and, indeed, the Minister hung his hat on mere perception. Perception is important, and it is important here. The Minister talked about the Intelligence Services Commissioner and said that he is appointed by the Prime Minister. I might accept the Prime Minister as an alternative to Secretary of State. What I am worried about is that the commissioner will have more to do with the Secretary of State and the overseeing of the Secretary of State&#039;s stewardship of the whole scheme than anyone else. Therefore, this is an issue on which it is worth testing the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="60130-12_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal </b>   moved Amendment No. 77:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>Page 21, line 37, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>(   )   Where the Commissioner reviews any arrangements in accordance with subsection (2), his review must include, in particular, a review of the extent to which the arrangements make appropriate provision&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>(a)   for securing the confidentiality and integrity of information recorded in the Register; and</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>(b)   for dealing with complaints made to the Secretary of State or a designated documents authority about the carrying out of the functions mentioned in that subsection.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 77, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 and 84. Amendment No. 77 clarifies that the National Identity Scheme Commissioner&#039;s jurisdiction includes keeping under review the arrangements for securing the confidentiality and integrity of information on the register as well as the arrangements for handling complaints. I listened very carefully to the concerns <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_43"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

raised by noble Lords in Committee and I hope that this amendment goes some way towards addressing those concerns.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Noble Lords were particularly concerned about complaints handling. As the amendment clarifies, the commissioner will have oversight of the complaints handling procedures and, no doubt, will include in his report any concerns that he or she might have about the way in which the agency is handling any complaints that it receives.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>As I said in Committee, nothing in the Bill would prevent the commissioner taking an interest in or making further inquiries about a specific complaint. What I do not think would be appropriate, however, is to give the commissioner a formal role in the investigation of complaints in general. Complaints handling will be a routine function that the new agency will need to fulfil, and I do not think it sensible for the commissioner to be responsible for dealing with every single complaint, however trivial. It would substantially change the nature of his role, which is, in essence, one of keeping the scheme, as a whole, under review.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Amendment No. 77 will also require the commissioner to keep under review the arrangements for securing the confidentiality and integrity of information recorded in the register. As I have made clear, I was most attentive to the concerns raised by noble Lords in Committee, in particular those about the security and integrity of the information held on the register. It is clear from this amendment that the commissioner must have regard to that and will report on it.


</p>

<a name="60130-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>However, we do not accept that the commissioner should have a formal role in requests for data correction from individuals. As I have made clear, the operation of the register will need to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. The duties of the Secretary of State as a data controller, the rights of the individual as a data subject and the powers of the Information Commissioner will all apply to the national identity register as they do to other databases. Where a person feels his data are being unfairly processed&#151;for example, because they are inaccurate&#151;he could approach the Information Commissioner, who has a power to impose enforcement notices on data controllers. There is also a right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to apply to the courts for rectification.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Amendments Nos. 78 to 82 seek to modify government Amendment No. 77. These are essentially unnecessary drafting amendments; they would have no substantive effect on the remit of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>We discussed at length in Committee the question of whether &quot;arrangements for using&quot;, under Clause 24(2)(c), would in this context include &quot;uses&quot;. As I said then&#151;and I stand by that view&#151;it would. Therefore, Amendment No. 78, which adds the word &quot;uses&quot; into the government amendment clarifying the scope of Clause 24(2), is particularly inappropriate, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_44"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the word &quot;uses&quot;&#151;as opposed to &quot;arrangements for using&quot;&#151;does not appear in the subsection which is being clarified.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Amendment No. 83 seeks to add to the powers of the National Identity Scheme Commissioner by allocating him a formal role in the investigation of individual complaints and in dealing with data corrections. I outlined in our discussion on Amendment No. 77 the reasons why that would not be appropriate. I therefore do not intend to repeat those comments now. Suffice it to say that the commissioner should scrutinise the agency&#039;s own complaints-handling procedures and report on those as he or she sees fit. Staff of the agency will be under a duty to co-operate with the commissioner and provide information to him by virtue of Clause 24(4). If the commissioner is not satisfied with the handling of complaints in general, or a complaint in particular, he can raise it with the Secretary of State and refer to it in his reports under Clause 25, all of which will be laid before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Amendment No. 83 also seeks to give the commissioner a role in data correction in individual cases. I have already outlined why we believe that this amendment is inappropriate and I do not intend to say more on that. Individuals will be able to check the details of their own entry on the register. We hope to make that possible by means of a secure online check. I know that noble Lords were concerned about how to ensure that the facility operates easily, smoothly and sensibly. We think that this proposal will be helpful. In any event, they will be able to make a written subject access request under the Data Protection Act.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>If individuals are concerned that there is an error on the register, they can request that the information is removed or corrected. In the normal course of events, the problem should be solved without the need for reliance on formal legal rights. Ultimately, however, as I indicated, an unreasonable failure to rectify information can be the subject of a formal application for rectification made to the courts under Section 14 of the Data Protection Act.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Amendment No. 84 seeks to add to the remit of the National Identity Scheme Commissioner both general policy matters and areas that are currently excluded from his remit if any of those areas raises a matter of substantial public interest. The effect would be that the commissioner would have oversight of an excluded matter where a particular case raised a concern of substantial public interest.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>In Committee, I outlined why the matters set out in Clause 24(3) have been excluded from the jurisdiction of the commissioner: because they fall under the jurisdiction of other bodies, be it Parliament, the courts or a different statutory commissioner. I also gave a detailed account of why the matters contained within paragraphs (a) to (d) of Amendment No. 84 are not issues with which the commissioner should become involved. I do not propose to repeat those arguments as I am sure that all noble Lords opposite have had the opportunity to read them in detail; it was on 19 December 2005, at col. 1522.

<a name="60130-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Amendment No. 84 would, additionally, give the commissioner oversight of &quot;general policy matters&quot;. Our view is that it is unnecessary to include that in the Bill. The Secretary of State will be establishing the policy for the agency and the agency will implement that policy. The commissioner will be keeping under review the arrangements made by the agency, by designated documents authorities or those to whom information is provided. Nothing in the Bill prevents the commissioner from commenting on any policy matter in one of his reports. Indeed, we would expect him to do so. However, we are of the view that it is inappropriate to list in the Bill all matters which the commissioner may choose to look at, or comment on in his reports. To do that would make the legislation unnecessarily lengthy, and in our view that should be avoided.
</p>

<a name="60130-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I hope that I have been able to reassure noble Lords that the commissioner&#039;s remit is sufficiently wide to ensure that the scheme has the appropriate level of oversight and I would invite the noble Lords not to press their amendments. I absolutely understand noble Lords&#039; concerns to ensure that the commissioner has comprehensive opportunities to make comment. We believe that the way in which we have drawn Amendment No.77 enables the commissioner to do everything which is proper. I therefore beg to move while inviting the noble Lords not to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Of the five amendments in my name, Amendments Nos. 78 to 82, the one which seems to have, dare I say, particular merit is Amendment No. 78. I am not quite clear why the Minister rejected it. Clause 24(2) sets out four areas where,

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could review what she said on that. I will certainly do so. I accept that Amendments Nos. 79 to 82 are inessential amendments, but I thought that they were improving ones.

<a name="60130-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, when, on the sixth day in Committee, amendments were moved to ensure that the commissioner would review and report on the extent to which there were proper arrangements for securing the confidentiality and integrity of the information recorded in the register and that there were effective arrangements for dealing with complaints, the Minister argued, at col. 1519 of the <i>Official Report</i>, that it was not necessary to do so as the spirit of the amendments was already reflected in Clause 24 and because the existing complaints procedures were more than adequate. She has now taken a welcome step forward and her new Amendment No. 77 is certainly helpful.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The Minister has argued that the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, are largely drafting amendments and do not add very much. He said that they were improving amendments but did not pursue most of them with any great determination. I think that there is a rather stronger case to be made out for them. In our last debate on these issues, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, pointed out that the commissioner&#039;s role was confined to considering structures and frameworks. The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, tighten up the new subsection to ensure that the commissioner will not just examine appropriate provision but will consider whether the arrangements really are effective and work in practice.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The issue of complaints had been raised by the Select Committee on the Constitution in paragraph 7 of its third report. The last time that we debated this matter, the Minister argued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;It would be wrong to give the commissioner a formal role in the investigation of complaints&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>She repeated that argument this afternoon. She then said that it would be a routine function that the new agency would need to fulfil and that the United Kingdom Passport Service already had a tried and tested system for dealing with complaints. On that occasion, she did not appear to recognise that the handling of complaints about the accuracy of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

register and the uses to which it will be put is not at all the same as the handling of complaints about the manner in which passports are issued.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The Minister went on to give us a description of what she believed was a satisfactory complaints procedure. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;There is an existing four-stage complaints procedure which includes a review by the local customer service manager, followed, if not satisfied, by a review by the headquarters&#039; customer service department. If not satisfied, a complainant can write through their MP to the Passport Service chief executive or a Home Office Minister and then, as I have already said, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration&#151;the ombudsman&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/12/05; col. 1520.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Anyone who has had to deal with the so-called &quot;customer service&quot; organisation of any large body&#151;as I have had to do recently&#151;will know what a nightmare it can be. After a long session in which you are asked to key in various numbers on your telephone and a prolonged lecture&#151;admittedly, usually imposed by some regulator&#151;about your rights, you then listen for probably a quarter of hour, at your expense, while someone says that you are a customer and your custom is greatly valued. Eventually you get through, only to be moved on to someone else and to have to wait for another 22 minutes&#151;as happened to me the other day&#151;before you get connected. If the Minister had had the privilege which some of us have had of being a Member of Parliament and going through the procedures by which you pass on complaints to Ministers and the ombudsman, then I do not think that she would have read that part of Sir Humphrey&#039;s draft with quite the confidence she did on the last occasion. It seems a far from satisfactory set of arrangements.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Amendment No. 83, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay, will give the commissioner the responsibility of setting up a system for dealing with complaints that tailor the whole thing to the requirements of the register. It would not give the commissioner himself the job of dealing with detailed complaints. I agree with the Minister that that should not be his role.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The final amendment in this group, Amendment No. 84, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay, takes up the issue raised by the Minister on 19 December, at col. 1523, when she attempted to justify the fact that the Bill requires the commissioner&#039;s reports to be made to the Secretary of State and not to Parliament on the ground that the Secretary of State must have the right to exclude sensitive material concerning security and crime prevention.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>It is hard to see why that should be necessary if the commissioner is specifically precluded from keeping those matters under review, as he is by Clause 24(3). We understand perfectly well, however, why there needs to be a protecting mechanism, and our Amendment No. 84, which will be very relevant when we debate the next group of amendments, maintains the necessary safeguards but allows the commissioner to keep under review general policy matters, particularly issues of substantial public interest that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may arise from particular cases without, of course, going into the details of those cases in a way that could prejudice security or crime prevention.
</p>

<a name="60130-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>That is a sensible way in which to proceed, and I hope that the House will agree.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60130-13_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   My Lords, it seems to me that unless the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, regarding usage is inserted, then the uses to which ID cards are to be put under subsection (2)(d) will be excluded from the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment. The amendment says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;Where the Commissioner reviews any arrangements in accordance with subsection (2)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>That refers to arrangements, not to uses. I understood the Minister to say when she introduced her amendment that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, was unnecessary. I am afraid that that is an abuse of the English language. If one says that we must look at arrangements, we look at arrangements&#151;uses are by their nature excluded. So a provision that puts in a &quot;use&quot; is either deliberate or bad English. Which is it?

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60130-14_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I seem to remember that the whole point about the previous amendment was that the Information Commissioner would keep a beady eye on all this stuff on our behalf and everything would be fine&#151;which is why we did not need the extra protection of Amendment No. 76. The word &quot;uses&quot; surely means data sharing, among other things. I would not necessarily call data sharing an arrangement. If it is trying to provide information, it is a use. I am sure that clever lawyers in government departments who wanted to get the information could argue that. I therefore believe that we need the word &quot;uses&quot; here, or we need Amendment No. 76 back.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60130-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the Government for tabling their amendment. It meets the commitment in their letter to noble Lords which followed our Committee debates. In the letter, they maintained that they had always intended that the National Identity Scheme Commissioner should as part of his function keep under review the development and operation of the complaints procedure to provide some kind of reassurance that the register is secure and reliable. They also maintained in the letter that they believed that the Bill already gives them the power to do that, but they offered to table an amendment to clarify the matter. That is what they have sought to do here. The whole question has been whether we are 100 per cent grateful or whether we feel that there is greater mileage in having greater clarity with regard to other amendments that have been tabled.


</p>

<a name="60130-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I have tabled two amendments with my noble friend Lord Crickhowell&#151;Amendments Nos. 83 and 84&#151;but there is a more important amendment to come, on which my noble friend will lead, in regard to where a report is laid. I therefore feel that it would be churlish to push ahead on Amendments Nos. 83 and 84. Although I would have preferred Amendments <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Nos. 83 and 84 to have been accepted, I am not going to go to the stake on the issue if there are other robust safeguards. I think that the House has already decided on one with the appointment of the commissioner. I hope that the Government will be able to accept my noble friend&#039;s Amendment No. 85 with regard to a report being directed at Parliament and not via the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>In soft pedalling and assisting the Government on Amendments Nos. 83 and 84, I am still not satisfied with the way in which the Minister sought to address the issue in Amendment No. 78, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. I agree with the noble Lord that, to coin a phrase, it is not appropriate to forge ahead on this one today given the other aspects of the debate and the other amendments on the role of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I am rather perplexed that the Government say the words &quot;and uses&quot; should not be inserted. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, about what those two words should cover and that they should be on the face of the Bill. The Minister has not fully satisfied me on this issue but, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, it is not something on which I am going to go to the stake.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60130-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hope I can clarify the issue in relation to &quot;uses&quot;. The uses to which ID cards are put have a direct role in the two matters dealt with by government Amendment No. 77, which relates to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Clause 24(2), but not to paragraph (d). That is why in opening in support of my Amendment No. 77&#151;we discussed this at some length and that is why I was reluctant to do it all over again&#151;I said that the &quot;arrangements . . . for using&quot; in Clause 24(2)(c) would in this context include &quot;uses&quot;. Therefore Amendment No. 78, which seeks to add the word &quot;uses&quot; into the government amendment which clarifies the scope of Clause 24(2) is particularly inappropriate. The word &quot;uses&quot;, as opposed to &quot;arrangements . . . for using&quot;, does not appear in the subsection which is being clarified. Our amendment relates to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Clause 24(2), but not to paragraph (d), which is why I say that it is correct.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I absolutely understand noble Lords&#039; concerns. We wish to draw Amendment No. 77 with the appropriate level of acuity. We believe that we have done so, because it does not relate to paragraph (d). With that further clarification, I hope that noble Lords opposite and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, will be appropriately grateful.

<a name="60130-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I fear that my legal intelligence may be much exercised and long in years, but it has always had a lumpen quality about it.

If I do not, I shall certainly not refrain from bringing the amendment back at the next stage, especially as I have had a great deal of support from other noble Lords.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>Page 22, line 26, leave out &quot;make a report to the Secretary of State&quot; and insert &quot;lay before each House of Parliament a general report&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now come to what I believe are two very important amendments. In considering the Bill, we must have as our first and primary responsibility the protection of the interests of the citizen. That should also be the first and primary responsibility of the National Identity Scheme Commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Baroness believes that the primary job of the commissioner is to advise the Secretary of State and to reassure him that the identity card scheme is operating correctly. That somewhat bizarre proposition was contained in the Minister&#039;s response to the seventh report of the Select Committee on the Constitution, which recommended that the commissioner should report directly to Parliament&#151;exactly as the Information Commissioner does, which seems a pretty good precedent. I urge the House to reject the proposition advanced by the noble Baroness and to accept Amendment No. 85, which would ensure that the commissioner lays reports before each House of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The existence of the register and the way in which it is used&#151;or misused&#151;are not trivial matters. They will affect fundamental rights and freedoms. As we discovered during our lengthy examination of the Bill, the Government are taking wide powers to amend the legislation by order. The noble Baroness, on day 6, acknowledged at col. 1518 that while there was no commissioner dealing with passports or driving licences, the Government recognised that the introduction of the identity card scheme, &quot;raises additional issues&quot;, and so believed that it was right to create what she termed a &quot;new level of oversight&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>We can surely agree that the matter raises additional issues. It creates the register to which a large number of organisations will have access. If we are to have a new level of oversight, surely in logic the commissioner should report to Parliament and not to the Secretary of State, whose department and agencies he is overseeing. It is crucial that the commissioner has the widest possible freedom to do his job and to report what he deems appropriate, subject only to restrictions regarding issues relating to security and crime prevention, contained in Clause 24(3), which we discussed in the previous group. In addition to the topics excluded by that clause from the matters that the commissioner is to keep under review, and which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_51"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 51</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

he can report on, my Amendment No. 85A will exclude from his report subjects which, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the commissioner judges to be prejudicial to security or the detection of crime.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The noble Baroness built her case to send the report directly to the Secretary of State around those security questions. In practice, and because of the combination of the two provisions to which I have referred, that argument cannot be sustained. The Minister may argue that Clause 25(3) requires the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a copy of any report made to him by the commissioner, but that is not the same thing at all.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Noble Lords with experience of how government works will envisage clearly the pressures that will be placed on the commissioner to exclude from his report any material that the Secretary of State would prefer to keep from Parliament and the people. That is particularly likely in the case of the Home Office. It is a great department of state, and it knows it. There is a certain feeling of superiority that makes those who work there feel that they are perhaps rather better than others&#151;the hoi polloi. It is the sort of attitude that I first experienced rather painfully in my first days as a member of the Cabinet dealing with the sensitive issues of Welsh language broadcasting.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I have had other experience&#151;not with the Home Office, but with other departments. Mine was an unusual pattern, in that I was first a Cabinet Minister for eight years and then for eight years I chaired a very large quango&#151;the National Rivers Authority. In our early days we established an enviable reputation for robust independence. Over the years that followed, both the department and the Minister of State responsible for agriculture sought delicately to assert some influence over the line that we should take. It was all beautifully done&#151;very seldom did the Secretary of State himself intervene. There would be a telephone call from a senior official, many of whom were close friends, and whom I greatly respected. There were clear implications that altogether life would be much smoother if we took a rather different line. There was a great deal of press briefing that Lord Crickhowell had gone native on the environment, which I took to be a considerable compliment. It was an indication to my successor when he took over at the Environment Agency that perhaps they would value and support someone who was rather less independent.
</p>

<a name="60130-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Partly on the basis of that experience, I do not want the commissioner to be placed in a situation when such pressures can be easily applied. I want him to be a free, independent and robust defender of the interests of every citizen whose name will have been placed compulsorily on the register, reporting not to the Secretary of State, but about the Secretary of State and his agency&#039;s management and conduct of the ID cards project and the register. I want his reports to be placed before Parliament directly, not indirectly. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_52"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Parliament, not the Executive, which is the proper defender of the interests of citizens and their rights. I beg to move.

<a name="60130-15_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   My Lords, the concept of identity cards is so alien to British history&#151;for several of us, it is extremely offensive&#151;that I hope that eventually the legislation will be repealed and cast into the dustbin of history. It is therefore extremely difficult to trust a Secretary of State in an Administration that has had, and continues to have, such a cavalier attitude to our historic liberties, or to trust a government not to do what my noble friend Lord Crickhowell says they will do. As my noble friend says, it is Parliament&#151;or should be&#151;that defends our historic liberties. We should certainly trust Parliament more than the Executive, however supine it sometimes is in the face of the Executive.

I remind the House that we had a tussle over the same issue when we debated the creation of the interception commissioner under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.

<a name="60130-15_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, there is an old saying that just because you are paranoid does not mean they are not out to get you. Some of us feel that that could arise with ID cards and the national identity register. The easiest way to allay this&#151;I hope unjustified&#151;paranoia and to believe that everything is all right would be to ensure that there is an independent check so that the report does not go through the very person who controls the national identity register. It is illogical that a person&#039;s employee, effectively, or someone within the same department, should report to the person on whom they are having to report. Instead, the commissioner should report directly to Parliament where liberties are, we hope, safeguarded. I very much support the amendment.

<a name="60130-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, as a former member of the other place, I should like to say a couple of words in support of the excellent amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. The way in which Parliament is being ignored and sidelined is increasingly worrying to me and to many other people. The great benefit of this amendment is that it will introduce a concept that, in matters of such import as the identity card register or the identity card itself, the <br>&nbsp;<br>

commissioner should be responsible through his report not to the Home Department but to Parliament. That is an altogether sensible proposition.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The Government ought to show goodwill by accepting the amendment. In so doing, they may very well restore confidence in the belief that the Government continue to believe in Parliament as the true representative of the interests and freedoms of this country and not simply as the servant of the political party that happens to be in power for the time being.
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60130-15_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I strongly support my noble friend&#039;s amendment, to which I have added my name. The Constitution Committee&#039;s third report made a clear recommendation that the commissioner should be able to report directly to Parliament. The amendment would achieve that objective, while also ensuring that a filtering mechanism would enable material to be excluded from the public report where there was a good reason to believe it would be prejudicial to national security or to the prevention or detection of crime. Despite the fact that the commissioner is appointed by the Secretary of State&#151;although, fortunately, if the Government accept the decision of the House, he will be appointed by the Crown&#151;we believe that he is carrying out a public function for which he should be accountable directly to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>As we have remarked in the past, the Bill&#039;s provisions mark a completely new departure in the relationship between the state and the individual. Parliament has a vital role to play in the system of accountability for the oversight of the operation of the scheme. Amendments Nos. 85 and 85A broaden the commissioner&#039;s powers by ensuring that that reporting takes place directly to Parliament. They provide a filtering system; we believe that the way in which a filter is provided to ensure that sensitive information is not included in the report that goes to Parliament fully meets the arguments put by the Minister when we debated these matters in Committee. I hope that the Government are now able to accept the amendments.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="60130-15_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I have listened very carefully to the arguments in support of these amendments. However, as I stated when we discussed these issues in Committee, the Government consider it necessary for the reports to be addressed to the Secretary of State with the potential for parts of them to be excluded from the report laid before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, says about that contention; he suggests that it is bizarre that we should so decide. However, this situation has prevailed in a number of other positions. I have already made it clear that there are precedents for the removal of sensitive aspects of the reports of statutory commissioners before they are laid before Parliament. For example, similar mechanisms to the one in this clause <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

apply in relation to the Surveillance Commissioner, the Intelligence Services Commissioner and Her Majesty&#039;s Inspector of Constabulary.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Clause 25 contains safeguards to ensure that there is sufficient scrutiny of the commissioner&#039;s reports, because all reports prepared by the commissioner will be laid before Parliament. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, says about his experience. The views that he expresses reflect the feeling almost of awe in which the Home Office was hitherto held. I can assure noble Lords that there is an appropriate degree of vigour and scrutiny when it comes to the Home Office of today. There is no longer any such imbalance.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>In addition, there are only two reasons why matters may be excluded from the report that is laid before Parliament. Those are if the publication of the material would be prejudicial to national security or to the prevention and detection of crime. A precedent for reporting directly to Parliament is, for instance, the Information Commissioner; he has very wide enforcement powers, but they are unrelated to national security matters. The Immigration Services Commissioner is a regulatory commissioner of immigration services providers who reports directly to Parliament. We have to look at each commissioner and the role that they are to perform, and then decide where the appropriate reporting responsibilities should lie. We believe that they lie in the way that we have outlined. This is not, as the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, would cast it, a cavalier attitude; it is a very careful and balanced approach to the way in which reporting should be dealt with.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Under Amendment No. 85A, the commissioner would have the final say over which matters would be excluded from his reports. We do not think that the commissioner is the right person to make that decision. The Secretary of State, by virtue of his overarching responsibilities, has a thorough overview of issues affecting national security and the prevention and detection of crime. For this amendment to be workable and for the National Identity Scheme Commissioner to be capable of making an informed decision about what should or what should not be excluded from the report, he would have to be briefed on national security and crime in the way that the Secretary of State is. Aside from being an illogical and disproportionate way of ensuring that certain sensitive information does not get into the public domain, that would significantly change the nature of the commissioner&#039;s role. I hope that that is not something which noble Lords would easily contemplate.
</p>

<a name="60130-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, talked about access to the register. In case noble Lords are under any misapprehension about that, I reiterate that a number of organisations which he suggests would have access to the register will not. I hope that I can reassure noble Lords that the Bill allows the Secretary of State to provide information in particular circumstances to those authorised&#151;for example, to the police or security services. However, provision of information that has been requested is very different from unfettered access, which this Bill does not allow.

</p>

<a name="60130-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, may well be right that this is a sign of paranoia. I hesitate to suggest that noble Lords are paranoid, but, for the purposes of this argument, I can certainly accept that the noble Earl may be right. Let me assure them that the Bill is not out to get anyone. It is delivering a fair, proportionate response, and the commissioner will have an extremely important role, which can properly be discharged in the way we have indicated. I hope that I have persuaded noble Lords to be a little more moderate in the way in which they consider the Government&#039;s proposals and not to press these amendments.

<a name="60130-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her response. I noted her description of the modern Home Office. I cannot say that it entirely coincided with my recent impression of the conduct of a number of Home Secretaries, but we shall leave that. I did not say that the defence that she had put up on grounds of security and law were bizarre; I said that I thought it was bizarre to believe that the primary job of the commissioner is to advise the Secretary of State and give him reassurance that the identity cards scheme is operating correctly. Indeed, I took seriously the arguments about security. I believe that the combination of Clause 24(3) with its tight direction to what can be looked at by the commissioner, combined with my Amendment No. 85A, will provide perfectly adequate protection. This is such an important matter that I want to seek the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I apologise for having been unable to attend the last day in Committee just before Christmas, when this matter would have been debated. I therefore hope that your Lordships will forgive me for retabling both this and other amendments on Report. The amendment proposes the establishment of a technical advisory board to advise on a number of areas relating to the development of the national identity register. I express gratitude to my noble friend Lord Cope. I have, as it were, borrowed the text of the amendment from him.

</p>

<a name="60130-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I can be certain that the Government will reject the amendment. As did the Minister earlier in our proceedings and in her helpful letter of 11 January&#151;I thank her for it&#151;she will list the various bodies that have been established to develop the scheme to fruition: the biometric advisory group, the Home Office&#039;s Biometrics Centre of Expertise, the biometrics <br>&nbsp;<br>

assurance group and so on. Nevertheless, the Government have invested a great deal of political capital in this Bill. It is a key component of their legislative programme for this Parliament. It is not unreasonable to suggest that our scrutiny so far has exposed manifest flaws in the scheme, not least in respect of cost, technology, civil liberties and privacy.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I make it clear that I do not in any way question the integrity or the expertise of the various bodies cited. Nevertheless, they are of necessity creations of government and, to that extent, their remit is rooted in the determination of the Home Office to enact this measure regardless. Quite apart from that, it is worth noting that, in making its recommendation, the Constitution Committee took due account of the bodies already established by the Government. It none the less felt the situation warranted the creation of an outside body to &quot;exercise informed judgement&quot;. That is what the amendment would provide. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="60130-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I fully support my noble friend. The amendment follows a recommendation of the Constitution Committee and it is eminently sensible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="60130-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches also think that there is much practical merit in the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="60130-17_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I fully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. It is a practical proposal that could well help: the more minds cast on the thorny issue, the better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60130-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am certainly grateful for the brevity of the contributions on this amendment. I shall endeavour to put over as effectively as I can our case in opposition to it. I have a strong sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu, because it was I who had to deal with the proposal of a technical advisory board during our consideration of RIPA.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, seeks to establish an advisory board to offer advice on the development of the national identity scheme and to report annually to both Houses of Parliament. The board&#039;s membership would consist of representatives from the IT industry, biometrics specialists, law enforcement bodies and civil liberties groups. The last groups would have a particular interest in the privacy of the individual.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>As the noble Lord said, the amendment was tabled in Committee and was then withdrawn for understandable reasons. As agreed, we addressed the amendment in correspondence at the close of the Committee stage. The letter was copied to all noble Lords who had taken part in the various debates on the Bill. As we stated in that letter, this additional scrutiny of the scheme is neither warranted nor necessary. That is because there is already sufficient independent oversight of the scheme&#039;s development.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>In the first instance, the National Audit Office will provide an expert and thorough examination of the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>

use of public funds. This is the case for all government projects. However, the identity cards scheme will have several additional layers of scrutiny, as we detailed in our correspondence. For your Lordships&#039; convenience, I will now repeat for the record exactly what we wrote.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The Government&#039;s biometrics assurance group will be chaired by the Government&#039;s Chief Scientist. It will review the biometric aspects of the ID cards programme, in conjunction with the Home Office&#039;s Biometrics Centre of Expertise, led by the Chief Biometric Officer, Marek Rejman-Greene. All this will build on the work of the ID cards agency&#039;s own biometric advisers and their co-operation with other recognised biometric research institutes, such as the National Physical Laboratory. This group has already met and will meet quarterly throughout the year.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Additionally, an independent assurance panel will look at project management, finance, procurement and the other aspects of the programme that are not covered by the biometrics assurance group. This panel, which meets monthly, is chaired by Mr Alan Hughes, a former chief executive of First Direct Bank. The chair of the independent assurance panel serves also as a non-executive member of the identity cards programme board. The IT infrastructure of the national identity register will also be put through an official security accreditation process, as laid out in Cabinet Office guidelines, before it can commence operations. Furthermore, this process will be followed by continuing audits of the register&#039;s IT security.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The scheme&#039;s development is also scrutinised by the principal users group and private sector users group, which represent the interests of public and private sector organisations who will make use of the scheme. Consultations have taken place between the identity cards programme and special needs groups and we will continue these. Additionally, there is continuing dialogue between law enforcement agencies and the programme team to ensure that their requirements are considered as the scheme develops.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Civil liberties and privacy groups have already taken part in the consultations, which took place on the scheme and on the draft Bill. In addition, the National Identity Scheme Commissioner will provide further scrutiny of the scheme, which will of course also be bound by data protection legislation and therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I hope that your Lordships would agree that, taken together, those will provide a very great variety and depth of scrutiny. We believe that adding further layers would not add to the quality of scrutiny, but duplicate it and increase the levels and layers of bureaucracy. The technical advisory board is therefore unnecessary. I can reassure the noble Earl that the scheme will not be implemented unless the Government are sure that the technology is robust and effective.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>It is worth making a few comments about the comparison with the Technical Advisory Board established under the Regulation of Investigatory <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_61"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Powers Act 2000. That board was created under the terms of the Act and is a very different creature from the board suggested in this amendment. The role of the board is very closely defined. It ensures that any technical or financial obligations placed on industry arising from an interception warrant are reasonable. A company can appeal to the board if it believes that this is not the case; to date the board has not had to consider a single case. The board does not provide general advice about the development of operations, based on the Act as a whole. Such general advice is obtained through the close consultation between the Home Office and the industry itself. The board is required neither to report to Parliament, nor to have its membership approved by Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60130-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>With the development of the independent assurance panel, the biometrics assurance group, consultations with public sector, private sector and special needs user groups, and the advice of the scheme commissioner, we believe we have put in place a comprehensive framework to ensure independent, wide-ranging and informed advice, which can be obtained to guide the development of the scheme in total. I reject the assertions made by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, that we are failing to address issues of cost or technology, or the development of the scheme as it unrolls. We have put in place many safeguards and structures to ensure that we have a structure and a number of bodies in place, which will enable us to consult extensively throughout the development of the identity cards programme. For those reasons, we reject this amendment and I invite the noble Earl to withdraw it.

<a name="60130-18_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. As I made plain in my introduction to the amendment, I had anticipated the content of his response. To that extent my expectations have not in any way been disappointed. Our debates today have focused very firmly on the principle that oversight of the whole ID scheme should more properly reside with those who are truly independent of the Home Office and the rest of government. I have to continue to beg to differ with the noble Lord, given that so many uncertainties persist in respect of cost, technology and so on. To my mind it is necessary that the development of policy should also be subject to truly independent oversight. My intention is again to be of assistance to the Government. After all, the existence of a technical advisory board should pre-empt the possibility of the Home Office being inadvertently led down policy avenues that turn out to be technological dead ends or the like. Be that as it may, I shall carefully read the noble Lord&#039;s comments&#151;even though I virtually wrote them for him in my introduction&#151;and reflect on where I may yet wish to take this matter. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment

I look forward to hearing from him and I suspect that he will have some trenchant questions to ask the Minister about the need for this clause, particularly in view of the existing protections available in the Computer Misuse Act. When this week the Government published their new Police and Justice Bill&#151;as if we needed another Home Office Bill; they rain down upon us&#151;I noticed in passing that there is reference in the Bill&#151;

<a name="60130-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I think the heart of the whole House goes out to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, because this is a very personal matter for her. She seems to be the only competent Minister in the House, to gather by the load put upon her shoulders. In all the clash and battle of conflict, I would like to register my sympathy for her.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="60130-18_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, indeed, we regularly share our heartfelt sympathy. It is just that we do not seem to be able to move her right honourable friend the Home Secretary in the right direction. He keeps on showering Parliament with these Bills.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>A couple of clauses in the Police and Justice Bill refer to computer misuse. I think that it would be helpful if we were able, between now and Third Reading, to see whether there is any read-across. I confess that when I downloaded the Bill in PDF format at the weekend, it took some while to do so by remote. I did not get to the stage where I could read every part of that Bill, but there may well be some read-across. By the look on the face of the noble Baroness, I hope that there may not be.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>We welcome the objective behind Clause 29, which is to create a criminal offence of disclosure without lawful authority of information that is held on the national identity register. Amendment No. 98 would put an obligation on the prosecution to prove that the person made the disclosure &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot;. We are merely seeking to ensure that somebody who accidentally makes a disclosure is not treated in the same way as somebody who has malicious intent in making that disclosure or, perhaps, is so unprofessional that he does not adopt what is normally good practice in his methods and therefore allows the material to be leaked.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I was rather puzzled by the response of the Minister in another place to a similar amendment. He held that the amendment was unnecessary because an individual who was conscientious and acting responsibly could find a defence in subsection (4). The difficulty in subsection (4) is that the defence only covers somebody who believes at the time of disclosure that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they have reasonable grounds or lawful authority to make the disclosure. I am concerned about the situation that may well arise&#151;and this may reflect what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has said regarding the assiduity of the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, and the huge workload that she carries&#151;where somebody who works wholeheartedly according to good practice throughout their career, but is very tired at the end of a long day, particularly if the Opposition have kept them in the House until 12.30 am, follows what they think is the normal procedure. This person does everything they possibly can to do the right thing, but when sending information by e-mail they simply press the wrong button and send out the information to the wrong recipient. Alternatively, perhaps they send out the information but it is corrupted and is not sent in the right way. My concern is that at that stage that person does not have the authority to disclose the information to the person who receives it, so although they think that they are doing the right thing&#151;that they have the authority to make the disclosure&#151;they disclose it to the wrong person, albeit not irresponsibly. Can we be assured that such a person will not come across any difficulty as a result of the current drafting of the Bill? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="60130-18_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, it may be of convenience to the House if I could speak in this group to Amendment No. 100, which proposes the deletion of Clause 31. None of us questions the desirability of maintaining the security and integrity of the register. At first blush, therefore, the inclusion of the clause to deal with the possibility of its being tampered with is both sensible and welcome. But, in reality, the way in which it has been drafted creates all sorts of problems. I shall turn to those in due course.


</p>

<a name="60130-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>First, it is important, so far as we can, to understand the IT architecture that the Government are contemplating. As the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, told us:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;The national identity register is not physically connected to the Internet or any publicly available network&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16/11/05; col. 1105.]
</p>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<a name="stpa_195"></a>I can understand that. Clearly, and sensibly, the intention is that the scheme should operate via closed and secure servers. But we also know&#151;because the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, has told us and, indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, confirmed it last week&#151;that facility will exist for individuals to access their records on the register via the Internet. I can understand that too. Presumably data will be uploaded to firewalled gateway servers, which will, in turn, access the secure register servers to submit the revised information or, indeed, for verification and validation purposes. In fact, as envisaged by Clauses 11 and 19 to 23, there will be a myriad of such gateways, not least to satisfy the law enforcement and national security purposes of the scheme. To that extent, therefore, it will probably be more accurate to say that the register will be &quot;connected&quot; to the Internet, albeit virtually rather than physically. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_64"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relates back to the point that I made earlier in respect of DNA data, but, again, I am not going to go down that path.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Unfortunately, so far as I understand it, Clause 31 creates only the offence of tampering with the register; it does not provide any protection for these gateways. That is crucial because, in effect, they are likely to be the weakest and least secure links of the design. To illustrate the point, we can consider so-called &quot;denial-of-service&quot; attacks. In effect, the gateways could be rendered inoperable by any given DOS attack, thereby compromising the register itself. Yet, as I read the clause, such a circumstance would not necessarily be covered by the current drafting.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The Government may wish to argue that the provisions of the Computer Misuse Act offer adequate protection in this regard&#151;something about which I and many others have expressed concern for some years. The Minister will know only too well that the view that the CMA provides adequate coverage is a very long way from being universally shared. Indeed, we have to approach its applicability to DOS attacks with healthy dollops of scepticism, not least because of the judgment a month or so ago in Wimbledon magistrates&#039; court.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Be that as it may, Clause 31 would appear in part to have been drafted to protect the register from such attacks, although, as I have already implied, I am far from convinced that the current drafting offers very much protection. Yet, in respect of all other governmental databases, it is argued that CMA is robust enough to be proof against such attacks. In her letter of 11 January&#151;again, I express my gratitude to her for it&#151;the noble Baroness correctly identifies that the provision in the Bill goes further than Section 3 of the CMA. Nevertheless, it strikes me as odd that the clause increases the penalties for unauthorised modification of information on the register while penalties for attacks on law enforcement IT systems or other elements of the critical national infrastructure system&#151;air traffic control, hospital support systems and so on&#151;remain consistent with the CMA. I do not decry the evident intent to secure the data on the register against attack&#151;indeed, at many levels I welcome it&#151;but can it really be said that it is that much more important a system than, say, the police national computer or the national health data spine, where, should their operation be compromised, a welter of life-threatening situations could develop?
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The Minister might like to imagine that the Police and Justice Bill, introduced in another place last Wednesday, offers adequate rebuttal to my comments here. On the face of it, Clauses 33 to 36 of that measure would appear to represent the much-needed update of the CMA. However, I am bound to say that Clause 35, intended to criminalise the development, distribution or possession of so-called &quot;hacker tools&quot;, is especially asinine&#151;not least because very few of these do not have entirely valid and legitimate uses.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Moreover, the fact that these clauses effectively replicate the drafting of Clause 31 of this Bill, giving the appearance of having been added almost as an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_65"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

afterthought, adds weight to my argument. Surely a more appropriate way forward here would be to update the CMA properly rather than, on the one hand, singling out the register for this preferential treatment and, on the other, seeking to rely on the decidedly suspect drafting of the Police and Justice Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Indeed, viewed from an alternate perspective, if, as the Government have previously maintained, the CMA is an adequate measure to deal with the problem of DOS attacks generally across their IT infrastructure, or if it is supposed that Clauses 33 to 36 of the new Bill update the CMA appropriately, what useful purpose is therefore served by including this clause at all? As we have already experienced today, in defending amendments that seek to write elements of data protection into Bills, Ministers never tire of telling us that to do so would be otiose because such extant legislative provision has efficacy in any event. Viewed logically, the same could be said of this clause in respect of either the CMA or the Police and Justice Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>But, as I have already implied, this is not the clause&#039;s only problem. Subsection (3)(b) is particularly troublesome. In terms, it defines &quot;unauthorised modification&quot; of data on the register as &quot;conduct&quot; which,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;makes it more difficult or impossible for such information to be retrieved in a legible form . . . or contributes to making that more difficult or impossible&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>A host of wholly innocent circumstances could occasion such an event. For example, it is not unheard of for systems to crash when being subject to routine maintenance or updating. The House will no doubt recall the recent occasion involving 60,000 desktop computers at the Department for Work and Pensions. Is it really the intention that IT contractors servicing government computers should be criminally liable simply for making a mistake, or are civil servants to face prosecution for going on strike? What, too, of forensic hacking&#151;possibly the most effective method of properly testing the parameters of an IT system&#039;s security and integrity? It seems to me that these are all circumstances that, notwithstanding the qualification of &quot;requisite intent&quot; at subsection (1)(b), could fall foul of the drafting at subsection (3)(b).
</p>

<a name="60130-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>As I have already indicated, I am fully aware of the contents of the letter of 11 January from the noble Baroness. It offers various reassurances about some of the issues that I have raised. While I suspect that a difference of opinion between the Government and myself will persist in respect of the Computer Misuse Act, none the less I should be extremely grateful if, for avoidance of doubt, the Minister could put on the record the interpretation of the scope of subsection (3)(b) contained in her letter when she comes to reply. Certainly that would assuage many of my anxieties about the clause. With that in mind, I look forward to her response.

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60130-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, subject to anything that the noble Baroness may say, it would seem to me to be just if Amendment No. 98 were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_66"></a>

accepted because criminal liability without intent or recklessness is generally unacceptable. But I find it hard to believe that the deletion of Clause 31, with nothing in its place, can be in the public interest, despite the extremely learned exegesis of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. Again, I look forward to hearing what the Government have to say but, as I said, I am inclined to oppose Amendment No. 100.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="60130-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I commend the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, for his opposition to Amendment No. 100. It is rare in this Bill that I have his company and I want to record my gratitude for it. I also want to record my gratitude for his sympathy and that of the noble Baroness&#151;I experience joy on a daily basis in appearing before your Lordships and going through these Bills. Far be it from me to have that joy curtailed, but I understand that in future your Lordships may be denied the undoubtable pleasure of my company in that we will, I hope, have fewer Bills.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Amendment No. 98 relates to the criminal offence of unauthorised disclosure of confidential information provided for in Clause 29. I understand what worries the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I understand that she rightly says, &quot;What about the person who, tired and worn down by the burdens of office, presses the right button or the wrong button? Will they be brought to book for it?&quot; Perhaps I may reassure the noble Baroness in that regard. I tried to give such reassurance as fully as possible in my letter; I am more than happy to repeat during this debate what I said in the letter. It is our view that a person who, acting in good faith in the course of his job, accidentally made a disclosure could avail himself of the defence of reasonable belief. This would apply even if it was a physical error, such as accidentally pressing the wrong button. The person would reasonably have believed, at the time he made the error, that he was acting with lawful authority. That is the concern properly expressed by the noble Baroness, and we are very clear that such a person would be protected.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Amendment No. 100 would remove from the Bill Clause 31 in its entirety. I understand that the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, put the amendment forward because he would like me to repeat the reassurances I gave in the letter and I am more than happy to do so. This clause introduces the offence of causing an unauthorised modification to the register. There is a similar defence to that in Clause 29. It is a defence for a person to show that he believed, on reasonable grounds, that a modification was authorised.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I am also aware that a number of trade unions are concerned about what would happen if lawful action was taken. I will therefore take this opportunity to mention two sets of circumstances which we do not consider fall within the remit of this offence. IT contractors who, in servicing government computers, made a mistake that resulted in computers crashing would not have committed this offence. Similarly, Clause 31 would not criminalise striking civil servants, on the grounds that their action might make it temporarily impossible to retrieve information. Subsection (3)(b) catches only action that makes it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_67"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 67</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more difficult or impossible for information to be retrieved in a legible form. It is aimed at deliberate acts of sabotage or the introduction of viruses and so on and will not catch a simple withdrawal of labour.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Noble Lords have expressed interest in the extent to which the provisions of the Computer Misuse Act already cover the offence of tampering with the national identity register. I know it is something that preys almost constantly on the mind of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. The Computer Misuse Act contains a range of offences designed to cover all aspects of computer misuse; indeed, that Act will, as the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, and the noble Baroness rightly indicated, be amended by the Police and Justice Bill in order to increase certain maximum penalties, and to respond to developments in cyber crime. The provisions of the Computer Misuse Act would apply to computer crime against the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Nevertheless, we felt it appropriate to create an offence of tampering, which relates specifically to the national identity register. Any computer crime against the register, which did not fall within the Clause 31 offence, could be dealt with under the wider provisions of the Computer Misuse Act. The Clause 31 offence attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years&#039; imprisonment and would apply even where the tampering was effected by someone working from a computer outside the United Kingdom. In saying that, I hope that I have given the noble Earl the reassurance he sought and have answered the question of the noble Baroness. I therefore invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_147"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move a manuscript amendment lodged today, grouped with Amendments Nos. 105A and 105B. Perhaps I may very briefly recount the unhappiness that existed at Committee stage with the whole of the penalty <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_68"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regime&#151;that is, Clauses 33 to 36. A whole host of amendments to those three clauses were put down at the Committee stage and a great deal of debate ensued. It is fair to say that the relative absence of amendments to those three clauses at Report stage reflects the fact that the Government gave us all considerable reassurance at Committee stage with the contents of their code. The code is going to govern the way the penalty provisions work.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>That, I think, is a fair statement of the background. My amendments are designed, first, to ensure that the code deals with one particular concern&#151;the warnings sent to those who are subsequently to receive penalty notices. Secondly, they deal with the issue of consultation. I shall refer first to the question of warnings. Clause 36(1) sets out that the Secretary of State,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;must issue a code of practice setting out the matters that he will consider when determining the amount to be imposed in any case by way of civil penalty under this Act&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>At Committee stage I made the point, which the Government did not seek to countermand, that this appears only to relate, and literally only relates, to the question of the amount of the penalty. In discussions afterwards I think there was acceptance that we needed to broaden the language of Clause 36(1) to make quite clear that the code of practice is concerned not only with the amount of the penalties but with the whole of the penalty regime in Clauses 33 to 35. Amendment 105A adds the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;the manner of proceeding under sections 33 to 35&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>alongside the issue of determining the amount of a penalty.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a> The amendment I put down this morning seeks to ensure that the warning given to those who have transgressed the ID regime is clearly part of Clause 36 and the manner of proceeding. I think I am right in saying that there is no reference anywhere in Clauses 33 to 36 to warning. There is of course long mention of notices of penalty, of appeals against penalty, and so on, but I am particularly concerned about the issue of warning. All those who spoke in Committee were anxious to ensure that the authorities would not impose a penalty until they had given the person against whom the penalty was to be imposed the chance to say what went wrong. Did they fall ill? Did they miss the bus? Is it wrong to say that they did not tip up at the place appointed and give their samples, or whatever else? In effect, it would ensure that the officials who have the task of arriving at the correct penalty do so with knowledge of the relevant facts; i.e. that the penalty should not be imposed before the explanation has been heard. Those who spoke in Committee felt that it was not good enough simply to say that there was a right of appeal. People do not want to have to make an appeal where no penalty should have been imposed. Again, it is fair to say that Ministers&#151;I believe that it was the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, who dealt with this matter&#151;were not in any way opposed to the common sense of what was then being advanced.


</p>

<a name="60130-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Manuscript Amendment No. 101A simply inserts a reference to the warning into Clause 33, so that it must <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_69"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be within the purview of Amendment No. 105A. The final amendment, Amendment No. 105B, deals with consultation and says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;Before the draft code is laid under subsection (4), the Secretary of State must consult with members of the public likely to be affected by the code&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>If one looks in Clause 17(5), which deals with checks to be made on the register by public authorities, one finds a comparable consultation provision.
</p>

<a name="60130-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I submit that there is no more sensitive and important aspect of the Bill than the code of practice. It is our reassurance, on these Benches, that the absence of a great deal of the mechanics of the penalties in the Bill is something that we can wear, given a full and fair code of practice. It follows that, if that is correct, it is as important to have public consultation over the code as any other part of the Bill. I shall leave it at that. I beg to move.

<a name="60130-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord on Amendment No. 101A and the whole issue of the warning. I do not think that it would be right if I repeated arguments on that, as I spoke on that subject in detail in Committee. The noble Lord is right in thinking that there was a feeling across the Chamber that it is not sufficient to say to somebody that there is a method of appeal; if you have not tried to be culpable in the first place, it is error rather than culpability, and one should not have to go through the position of going through a whole legal gamut of appealing to prevent a penalty being imposed.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Amendment No. 105B refers specifically to consultation. I agree with the noble Lord; it is as important here as it is anywhere in the Bill that there should be consultation with the public on these matters. That was certainly brought home to me very clearly when I had a meeting on another Bill last week&#151;the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill&#151;with a group of people who had come together for the first time to express their views about how immigration legislation will affect them. They are representatives of Chinese, Bangladeshi and Indian communities. We had a discussion beyond the remit of the Bill about how consultation is or is not carried out.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Last night, I received from the vice-chairman of the North London Chinese Association an email that is pertinent to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. The vice-chair raises the whole issue of how the Home Office currently carries out its consultation process and what plans it has to do so in future. I thought that it would be right to put on record one or two concerns that those communities have, because I have referred in the past to the race equality impact assessment, and the problems with that in this Bill. The questions that they ask are with regard to the fact that, if the Government are minded to carry out consultations&#151;perhaps on Amendment No. 105A, but generally on the Identity Cards Bill&#151;will they in future ensure that they,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;include a non-compulsory invitation to the respondent to disclose the respondent&#039;s ethnic group when someone . . . responds to a government consultation&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Would they,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_70"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>and will they,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;encourage the Home Office to hurry up with the standard list of stakeholders&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>which they understand that the Home Office is in the process of compiling? They hope that the Government will,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;make positive efforts to include the Chinese community and business associations on it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>That raises the whole issue of how the Government anticipate consultation being carried out. In particular, will they consult on the code of practice with regard to penalties? That is a core issue; there will be a great deal of interest from the public generally and from specific ethnic groups within the community about how they would be affected by the code of practice on penalties. We have already had an indication of that from the CRE earlier in our debates on this measure.

<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60130-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, not for the first time, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, for his amendment&#151;in particular, his manuscript Amendment No. 101A to Clause 33, as well as his amendments to Clause 36, which raised some important points that require clarification.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>On Amendment No. 101A, we agree that there needs to be a warning before a penalty is imposed, but that this needs to be in the code of practice and not in the Bill. That is where we think it is most appropriate. However, on Amendment No. 105A, we believe that the noble Lord has spotted what we accept is an unintended omission from the Bill. The amendment is designed to widen the scope of the code of practice on civil penalties, which is required under Clause 36, from simply determining the amount to be imposed in any particular case by way of a civil penalty to the whole procedure for imposing civil penalties. That is how we are already interpreting the scope of the code; the initial draft that we issued on 9 December covers the whole procedure for civil penalties&#151;not just the determination of the amount of the penalty. I invite the noble Lord to accept that point. We therefore accept that the code must be considered when determining not only the amount of the penalty to be imposed but whether a civil penalty should be imposed. On the basis that we bring back a government amendment on this at Third Reading, I invite the noble Lord not to move Amendment No. 105A.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Amendment No. 105B would require consultation on the code of practice on penalties with members of the public likely to be affected before it is laid before Parliament. Again, we have sympathy with the purpose of the amendment. We intend to consult extensively on the code; indeed, as the noble Lord and the noble Baroness would readily acknowledge, we have already prepared an initial draft, which I am sure that many noble Lords have seen. It was placed in the Library on 9 December, and is on the identity cards website. Anyone with access to the Internet may now <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_71"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

view it and comment on it if they wish. Once the Bill has received Royal Assent, we shall be in a position to launch a more formal consultation exercise. Having said all that, we do not believe that there is any need for the consultation to be specified as a requirement in the Bill. Although we are anxious to have the widest possible consultation, we have not yet undertaken specific ethnic monitoring of those who have responded; but we can look at the analysis of those who have responded and we shall look again to ensure that we are getting a representative response from ethnic minority groups.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>I hope, having said that, that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60130-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful reply. I shall make two points. First, the Minister started by welcoming Amendment No. 101A and went on to say that of course the issue of warnings is integral to the whole proceedings under the relevant clauses&#151;and that must be so. But I should be grateful if he would let me know, before I withdraw the amendment, whether the issue of warnings will find a place in the Bill at all. It seems odd that it does not, when it is such a crucial part of the whole mechanism. I do not see how an amendment to Clause 36 will cover the point if there is no reference in previous clauses to warnings. I do not see why it should not be relatively simple for the Government to bring back an amendment, drafted less clumsily than mine, which at least makes that clear.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Secondly, the Minister accepts the importance of consultation. I too accept, and meant to say, that the draft code is already helpful. However, I do not for the life of me understand why the Government think it necessary to have a reference to the need for the Secretary of State to consult under Clause 17(5), but not under this clause. There is nothing more sensitive in public terms than the whole code in relation to penalties. I ask him at least to respond by saying that the Government will look again at the need for consultation under this part of the Bill, just as it already has it with regard to Clause 17. There is a reference to consultation in Clause 16 as well. Subject to those two points, I am a very malleable chappie, and I am inclined not to press the amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60130-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am interested that the noble Lord thinks he is malleable. I have not noticed him being putty in our hands before. He is a very agreeable noble Lord, as is the noble Baroness, to deal with on practical matters.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>On the first question he raised, the issue of warning letters will not be dealt with in the Bill in the way he would like to see, but it will be incorporated as a matter of procedure in the code. We think that is where it is most appropriate, and that is how we intend to deal with it.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>On his second point, the consultation requirement is in Clauses 16 and 17 because there will be representative bodies of users of public services who would be appropriate to consult; for example, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_72"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

education and health interest groups in particular. But which members of the public are likely to be affected by the code of practice on civil penalties? Perhaps it is those who intend as a matter of misguided principle, one might say, not to comply with the provisions of the Bill. I cannot accept that special arrangements must necessarily be made to consult with those who intend to defy the law.
</p>

<a name="60130-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The code will of course be laid before Parliament&#151;as I said earlier on the website, so people can look at it carefully there&#151;and we think that is sufficient. There will be ample scope for consultation within the framework we have set out. It will be extensive, and it is our intention to reach out to those groups who would otherwise ordinarily feel excluded from consultation, because we need to have their views on the way these procedures and penalties would operate.

<a name="60130-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for that further explanation.

&quot;PROOF OF IDENTITY

(1)   A passport issued to a British national by the United Kingdom Passport Service shall be proof of that person&#039;s identity.

<p><a name="st_171"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to move this amendment in this, the 100th anniversary of the Labour Party. I was sorry not to be invited to that great occasion, but I wonder, as history passes by, whether this legislation will be deemed to be groundbreaking or backbreaking. As I said to the Minister the other night, I think we are all on the same side, but we are all confused from different levels. I believe that people in this country accept the value of an identity card. Having accepted that, it is only a question of what identity card, and for what purpose. This is effectively the purpose of my amendment.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I moved a similar amendment before, and withdrew. I also moved an amendment where there was a certain bit of confusion, but I wish to go back and say that the Minister and I start from opposing sides of the world. I start from the ultimate proof of identity&#151;the passport. Having asked her if she would reconfirm the Answer I have had before to a Written Question, I would like to read it out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;The United Kingdom Passport Service, an executive agency of the Home Office, issues passports to British nationals in the UK. British passports are issued at the discretion of the Secretary of State by exercise of Royal prerogative, in line with the British Nationality Acts. A passport is issued only after an applicant&#039;s nationality status and identity has been confirmed, and is accepted throughout the world as proof of these&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 22/6/04; cols. <i>WA 121&#150;22</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The passport, therefore, is the ultimate identity card. There is no stronger identity card, none more valued, and it should not be replaced.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>We came afterwards to a certain little argument about what words should appear, and what name. I moved an amendment, which I withdrew, that the name should be as recorded in his passport, or in the form required for a passport. At that time, the noble Baroness did not quite agree with us and there was a rather amusing debate when we all accepted that none of our names would qualify.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_75"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, as the other day I made a mistake. I was overwhelmed and forgot my lines. I called him &quot;the noble Lord, Lord Swindon&quot;. In 18 of the 22 countries of the EEA, his last name is Swindon and, therefore, that is his last name. He pointed out in the debate that he was sometimes known as &quot;Lord Stod of Swin&quot;. I am an &quot;of&quot; but the last bit of my name&#151;&quot;Croydon&quot;, of which, being a Scot, I am not desperately proud&#151;does not appear in my passport because it is not a registered name. We went through some confusion, but the noble Baroness satisfied us in one of her notes&#151;I was the only one in the Chamber who received it&#151;which said that they were asking for the name that individuals are known by for all purposes, which is what applies when one goes for a passport. Without my having to move an amendment or to press it, the noble Baroness has quietly, surreptitiously and kindly answered my question. We have accepted that the passport is the ultimate proof of identity and that one&#039;s name will be as in one&#039;s passport. If that is the ultimate identity card, why do we need the Bill at all? If we started from the viewpoint that the identity card was the passport, we might not need it.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Secondly, the amendment says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;the United Kingdom Passport Service should issue upon request to any British passport holder an identity card&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>which will come anyway. It may be called a biometric identity card, but it will go with the passport. I then put in brackets &quot;British National Identity Card&quot; because that is how it should be known. If it is the ultimate identity card and it is proof of your nationality as a British national, why not call it the British national identity card?
<a name="time_19"></a>

</p>

<a name="60130-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I also asked the Minister about all these foreigners who come over here. How will we know who they are? Surely they should have their nationalities on their identity card. The noble Baroness said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;I thank the noble Lord. The truth is that EU citizens do not have to surrender their own national cards when they come here. However, they will be eligible for a UK card if they are resident here, but it will not show nationality&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, 15/11/05; col. 1008.]</i>


</p>
</ul>
<a name="60130-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Anyone who does not have a British national identity card is a foreigner. I believe that we are keener to identify foreigners with identity cards than ourselves. However, that leads to even more confusion. I tried to push the Baroness gently at the time and asked whether there would be more than one identity card. She said, &quot;No&quot;. I shall not quote her, as I cannot remember the column number and I shall lose my place in my papers. She said that there would be only one identity card. So I moved an amendment saying, &quot;Let&#039;s make sure that we could not have more than one&quot;. Then she kindly said, &quot;No, you can&#039;t do that because we might have to have more than one&quot;. There was then a flurry of feathers in the Home Office hen coop, and bits of paper came rushing across. The noble Baroness said, &quot;Yes, there will be lots of identity cards effectively&quot;, and she even used the words &quot;et cetera&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_76"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>It does not really matter if we have lots of identity cards, but it may have an impact on costs. The passport is the ultimate identity card and, to go with the passport, I hope, will be the British national identity card, which will enable us to travel within 22 or so states. The noble Baroness also pointed out that there were reasons for having the card because, effectively, it would be a travel card rather than an identity card. I suggest that it is an identity card, part of whose purpose is for travel. So that it may go on the record, I point out that the 22 countries that have identity cards for travel at the moment are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. There is no reason why the United Kingdom should not join that happy band of bedfellows. However, in many cases their identity cards and the data for them come from their passports, but there are problems when it comes to biometrics. The Germans do not want biometrics in any way. We will have biometrics, but if we have only two fingers that will take up two-thirds of the cost of the card, and there may be problems. I would like to ask the Minister&#151;I may put down a Written Question&#151;whether she could set out the conditions and data on each of the identity cards of the 22 states so that we can see how they are different. There is no point in us demanding more than is necessary to travel to those countries if that is one of the purposes of the British national identity card.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>I now come to the important question of the proof of identity. If the passport is the ultimate, then the British national identity card will come second and everything else comes third. In response to a Written Question from me, the Government kindly wrote back that the Department for Work and Pensions accepted 22 different pieces of paper for proof of identity. So the first thing in addition to the British national identity card is that there should be an identity card that is related solely to applications to the Department for Work and Pensions team for grants. That may be a slightly different one and of a different colour.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Of course, other identity cards are issued at the moment to officials of government and the third identity card that I want to suggest is the name, rank and number card. Any official of government who has a right to demand information or to enter people&#039;s premises should have his own identity card with his name, rank and number on it and should present it when he comes to people&#039;s premises. That is not a complicated issue.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Then we come to another point. It is right and reasonable that those of us who are entitled to benefits after a certain age&#151;retirement age&#151;whether it be the winter fuel allowance or pensions or bus passes or others, should have an identity card that prevents us from having to run around producing other pieces of paper to prove a known fact.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_77"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I do not think that there is any need for a restriction on the different types of card that may be issued, but I have a problem with the register. On most occasions when one presents an identity card, no one will have a reader, so the only method of identification will be the visual information on the front of it. It will matter not what biometric data are on it. In recent readings on the Continent, 30 per cent of the biometric data readings for a face failed to recognise it. I refer back to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, who, when I asked whether the card would have one&#039;s sex on it, said that proof of identity would be the photograph. I found in the research that I did recently that almost two out of three women to whom I spoke had changed their hair colour and the shape of their head and recognition was quite difficult. Even when one walks around the Bishops&#039; Bar, I have found it difficult to identify people from the photograph hanging from their neck.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>If people wish to prove their identity&#151;that is where I am coming from&#151;they must have something that they can present that enables people to recognise them or to check who they are. That is not a particularly difficult exercise. I do not intend to press the amendment, but, if we start with the passport and accept that that is the ultimate proof of identity, all other pieces of paper or plastic cards are, effectively, secondary. When I asked the noble Baroness whether I could have everything on my card&#151;I would like everything that is on the identity register to be on my card&#151;she said that I could not. A driving licence is not really proof of identity, but it is accepted by some people as proof of identity. If on your British national identity card you do not have your driving licence data, there is no method of proving with that card that you have the ability or the right to drive, particularly if you are travelling internationally. As your Lordships know, the British driving licence is not really accepted as proof of identity for car hire in many places, because it does not have the secondary piece of paper containing any points that you may have run up through bad behaviour.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I become more and more confused by this. The Minister says that we can have only one identity card and now we may have two but only in certain circumstances, preferably when we are bisexual or something like that. Can she not admit that we might be able to have all sorts of identity cards that could replace some of the other requirements to prove who we are? When we come to nationality, there is no reason at all why the card should not have certain extra bits on it; for example, the Welsh might have a Welsh card and the Scots a Scots card. There is no difficulty at all. When we come to the private sector, however, the only acceptable proof of identity in the banking sector in many parts of the world tends to be the original of your passport or a certified copy of it. As we have suggested that the identity card will help people with the commercial or private sectors, I would like to know how and where. Ultimately, some of the rules still say, under the banking regulations, &quot;know thy customer&quot;. Even more under the new banking <br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation, you have a duty to probe and push as far as you can. Those institutions will not have access to the identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I am not flying kites or chasing hares. I am simply asking what the maximum number of identity cards that we might have in issue is and whether more identity cards will cost more than one. I beg to move.

<a name="60130-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, maybe we could replace the whole Bill with this clause. If this is about identity cards&#151;it is the Identity Cards Bill&#151;we have got it here. Of course, it is not an identity cards Bill, it is an identity register Bill. However, there seems to be some merit in having the passport office issue these simple identity cards.
</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I have some sympathy with that. The difficulty is that I cannot accept my noble friend Lord Selsdon&#039;s amendment, because I would have to accept the rest of the Bill&#151;and that is the bit that I do not like. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, says, the problem is the register at the foundation of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>My noble friend Lord Selsdon has raised some interesting questions, which the Minister needs to answer. The public have not yet thought through how an ID card will look to them. If one is asking for proof of identity, one needs to have some security in looking at an ID card and knowing whether it is likely to be an ID card or not. One will not have a reader, whatever the technological ways of reading it might be; one is going to have to have a visual check. So we need to know what will be on the face of the card. Is it going to look the same in all circumstances in which it may be issued? We come back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, that the problem is really with the rest of the Bill and the register. This is an identity register Bill, and I therefore look forward to my noble friend Lord Selsdon&#039;s Amendment No. 120A.
</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, in moving his amendment, gave an excellent demonstration of why we needed an identity card because of the multiplicity of uses to which it can properly be put. When we last debated this, I talked about having more than one card if one was an Irish national, for instance, and wanted to have a card that did not have nationality on it. Anyone resident here for three months or more would have an identity card, but it would not identify them as British because it would be held on the basis of residence. So the difference in identity cards was as a result of the group into which the individual who applied for one fell. It is likely, however, that the majority of us would just have the one identity card.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The noble Lord talked about bisexuals. I think that he was referring to the comments that I made about transsexuals, those who are moving from one gender to another but needed to have the cards because they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_79"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

had not quite transferred their gender and were therefore in a somewhat delicate position between the two.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   That was an unfortunate Freudian slip, my Lords, for which I apologise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I absolutely understood what the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, was getting at.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am completely foxed. What happens to the person in transition between two gender states? What sort of card will they get?
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords&#151;I almost said &quot;my Lady&quot;, another Freudian slip&#151;it would be possible, if one was moving from one gender to another, to have a card that was originally issued to one in the gender of birth but, as a result of changing gender, to have a second card issued in the gender of designation. Noble Lords will remember the long and complex debates that we had on transsexuals and whether a transsexual was a transsexual if they had not gone through the operation. There are those who will not be able to go through with the operation but will still be entitled to the transgender transference, if I can put it that way. I do not want to revisit those debates. I am sure that noble Lords remember them all too well.
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="60130-22_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60130-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The information on the face of the cards will, as I think that I have said on a number of occasions, comply with the International Civil Aviation Organisation&#039;s standard for travel documents, as must the passport. The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon has made that point on a number of occasions. That compliance is what makes it a travel document, as opposed simply to an identity document. The information on the card will resemble what is on the passport. The final specification will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so Parliament will have the final say on what, precisely, goes on the face of the document. As before, however, I assure the House that the address will not be on the face or the chip of the card as, indeed, the address is not on the body of the passport&#151;as noble Lords will know&#151;although you can put information in the back about people to be notified and matters of that sort.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, that the most significant means of identity is the passport. As noble Lords are aware, passports provide the foundation for our identity scheme proposals. Under our proposed scheme, however, the ID cards will be more than a portable form of British passport. The scheme will cover everybody resident in the UK for more than three months&#151;that is the real distinction between the passport and the ID card scheme. It will therefore include foreign nationals and British nationals who do not hold a passport. It is only by having a scheme that applies to everybody that the full <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_80"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

benefits will be realised. As is clear from the statutory purposes in Clause 1, ID cards, backed up by the national identity register, will be more than a government travel document for British citizens. Therefore, in so far as Amendment No. 111 represents the extent of the vision of the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, for an identity card scheme in this country, we do not share it.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I understand the thrust of what the noble Lord says about 80 per cent of people having a passport, which is the primary source of identity. We have a database containing all that information that can, with propriety, be accessed in certain specified circumstances. When we add the biometric information to that system, we will, in essence, have many of the features of the proposed identity card scheme. We will not, however, have the safeguards&#151;the commissioner and the ability to audit what happens, checking on the use to which the card is put&#151;or the universality. We will therefore continue with the current position, where those of affluence tend to have a passport and those who are not affluent and do not travel have to find other means of proving their identity&#151;often their MP, doctor, or some other form. They will find it increasingly difficult so to do. The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, is also right that, in the event of trying to prove one&#039;s identity, it is often requested that one produce one&#039;s passport. Those who do not have one labour under that disadvantage. I can see why the noble Lord says that the passport is the most profound and useful form if identity. It is, but we therefore feel that it is the foundation stone on which the ID card scheme should be built.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Subsection (1) of the amendment would codify the position of the passport as a secure and well trusted form of identification document. As I have indicated, the passport is, at present, considered a secure means of proving identity because of the security measures and procedures used in issuing it and the techniques used in its manufacture, which make forgery difficult. Our proposed scheme of identity cards&#151;and, for that matter, the new biometric passports&#151;will be issued with even higher levels of security and certainty.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay says: in essence, before the readers come in, people will use the photographic representation to check. As we become familiar with the nature and form taken by identity cards, being able to recognise that easily will also be of great importance. It is that security and certainty and the ability to verify their continuing validity from the register that will make people trust them as the best proofs of identity, not an assertion in legislation that they should be so.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>We really should lay to rest our fascination with the register. We already have the equivalent of a register for passports. It is a database that holds all information currently held by the Passport Office about the 80 per cent of people in this country who have a passport. We simply do not call it a register.
</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60130-22_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the latter hedging by the Minister. If the passport is the ultimate identity card and thus what I call the &quot;British <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_81"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

National Identity Card&quot;, which the Minister calls a travel card, and is accepted as proof of identity by all government departments, it might be well be so accepted by anyone else.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We must separate ourselves, as British nationals, from foreigners. That is not because I am trying to be too simple, but because if we do that, we need not go through all this great expense. The point is that, at present, it would cost only &#163;10 to produce an identity card to go with the passport. As the Minister rightly says, 80 per cent of people in this country hold a passport, yet the proportion is higher among lower ages. In the older groups, only 50 per cent have a passport, as they do not need them and may never travel.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I do not see why we cannot accept the concept of sticking to what the Minister calls a travel card. Instead of calling it that, we just call it a &quot;British National Identity Card&quot; based on the passport and encourage everybody to go the passport route. As little information will be contained on that identity card, the identity register is a separate issue. It may be needed at some time in future for other purposes than to prove who you are.
</p>

<a name="60130-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>I am not being controversial, but I must also quote the Minister to correct something. On 23 January, she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;I also tried to draw a distinction between the different types of cards that will be available. There will be the standard identity card for British citizens issued alongside a British passport&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-22_para11"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Here we have that spelt out in full:

<p>


</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>That seems like lots of cards to me. Maybe it is not, but I suggest that the Minister incorporates in the Bill a requirement that every official of government should have their own identity card, to prove their identity to non-officials. When someone turns up and shows their card, we have no idea whether it is true or a forgery or whatever.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>Before Clause 41, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>

<p>

&quot;PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OVER STANDARDS AND ADMINISTRATION OF ID CARDS

<br>
(1)   Parliament shall have the sole power to decide&#151;


<br>
(a)   whether a voluntary or compulsory ID card scheme shall be introduced in the United Kingdom;


<br>
(b)   who shall be required to possess an ID card, or shall be issued with an ID card, or be entered in the National Identity Register, in the United Kingdom; and


<br>
(c)   the security standards required in any ID card or National Identity Register in the United Kingdom.


<br>
(2)   No international body may impose on any United Kingdom citizen the duty to attend or to have attended at any place for the purposes of the issue, or in connection with preparations for the issue, of an ID card and a United Kingdom citizen shall have free passage throughout the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Union without the need to fulfil any such obligation, except as shall have been agreed, or determined, by statute in the United Kingdom.


<br>
(3)   No Minister of the Crown may enter into any undertaking within the European Union to introduce an ID card scheme or identity register in the United Kingdom, or propose or agree any common standards in relation to such a scheme, unless and until Royal Assent has been given to this Act or any other statute introduced for that specific purpose.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_181"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is the same amendment that my noble friend Lady Anelay moved in Committee on 12 December 2005, reported at cols 1098 to 1099 of <i>Hansard</i>. The debate did not finish until eighteen minutes past midnight, when we were all in a state of some confusion but had been promised a clarifying letter from the Minister. I shall return to that.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>The amendment would give Parliament&#151;the House of Commons and your Lordships&#039; House&#151;sole power over any UK ID card system and to prevent the Government from signing us up to any EU system without Parliament&#039;s explicit consent. The burden of my song in Committee was that I feared that Parliament had already lost the power to give effect to the amendment, even if it were passed. I pointed out that Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community&#151;the TEC&#151;which covers,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;Visas, Asylum, Immigration and other Policies Related to the Free Movement of Persons&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>was introduced at Amsterdam under unanimity. That means that we could veto measures introduced under it. However, by a unanimous Council decision in December 2004, the voting system on measures introduced under Title IV, except for legal immigration, was changed from unanimity to qualified majority voting, under Article 251 of the treaty.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>I then suggested that work being done in Brussels under the so-called Hague programme indicated that the Commission was moving towards proposing an EU-wide ID system, starting with minimum standards for each member state. For the record, I should mention that I omitted to mention a protocol at the back of the TEC. Protocol 4, on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, was inserted at Amsterdam and gave the UK an opt-out from Title I&#151;even if the other member states voted unanimously to change its decision-making procedure from unanimity to QMV, which they duly did. However, Article 3 of the protocol gives the UK and Ireland the power to opt <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_83"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in to any proposal under Title IV in which they wish to participate. Any such participation would now be by QMV except for proposals about legal immigration, which remain under unanimity.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>It is here that the plot thickens, in the shape of Council decision 15226/04 of 15 December 2004, a copy of which I shall place in your Lordships&#039; Library. Paragraph (13) of that decision says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland . . . those Member States&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>the United Kingdom and Ireland&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>So, it is pretty clear that we have opted into decision 15226/04, but what does that say? Paragraph (6) says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;the Council is required to act in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>in other words, qualified majority voting&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>&quot;when adopting, in conformity with the case law of the Court of Justice relating to the choice of legal basis for Community acts, the measures referred to in Article 62  . . . (2)(a)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>of the TEC. Other articles are mentioned; I do not need to trouble your Lordships with them to show where the labyrinth leads us.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>I trust that it is now clear that the United Kingdom has opted into Council decision 15226/04 and that we are therefore bound to accept any qualified majority vote in the Council for measures brought under Article 62(2) of the TEC. That article, under Title IV, covers,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82"></a>&quot;measures on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States which shall establish . . . standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at such borders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



<a name="time_21"></a>
<a name="60130-23_time0"></a><h5>7.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60130-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>It is pretty clear that an EU identity card system could be sanctioned by those words. The Minister may say something along the lines of what she said in Committee: that ID cards are not specifically mentioned as a measure covered under Article 62(2)(a), but the decision I quoted rubs in the fact that the Luxembourg court&#151;that engine of EU integration&#151;will alone rule on the decision&#039;s legal justification, as is always the case. When the Government have admitted more than once in Written Answers that Brussels is using Article 308 of the TEC, which sanctions measures only in pursuit of the objectives of the Common Market, as the legal justification for the EU&#039;s entire fundamental rights programme, how can they pretend that Article 62(2)(a) could not give rise to an EU ID card system?
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I have two brief, simple questions for the Minister, but before putting them, perhaps I should comment as kindly as I can on her letter to me of 10 January, following our debate on 12 December. In her first paragraph, she claims generically that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a>&quot;There is no question of ID cards being introduced by fiat from Brussels&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_84"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>She also says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84"></a>&quot;The introduction of ID cards is entirely a matter for the UK Parliament to decide&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Noble Lords should note that quotation. The Minister assures us that Parliament will have the final say, not the Government in the secret conclaves of Brussels. I fear that those statements will turn out to be wishful thinking. The Minister then goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85"></a>&quot;I should like to respond to what you say about Title IV of the EC treaty. Title IV is primarily concerned with border controls and the entry and residence of third country nationals in the community. It does not provide for the introduction of a European Union ID card&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>True, oh Queen, as such. But my contention is that it is wide enough to do so and that it will.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The Minister goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86"></a>&quot;In addition, the UK is only bound by measures drawn up under Title IV if it opts into them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="60130-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>That may be true under the terms of Protocol IV, as I have mentioned, but I trust that I have shown that the UK has indeed opted into the measures to be decided by qualified majority voting under Council Decision 15226/04 and several others. I could quote clauses out of the transport section of the treaty that would do just as well, but let us use that one for the moment.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>So my first question to the Minister is: are the Government saying that Decision 15226/04 could not&#151;even with the eventual support of the Luxembourg court, against whose decision there is no appeal&#151;be used to introduce an EU ID card system under Article 62(2)(a) or other articles in the treaty? If that is their position, I must ask them to explain the treaty basis for it. Why do they believe that that is the position when the treaty appears to say otherwise? Secondly, if the Government support the Minister when she says in her letter that the introduction of ID cards in the UK will be entirely a matter for Parliament to decide, why do they not accept the amendment and particularly subsection (3) thereof. If the Government mean what the Minister said, surely they must undertake that they, the Executive, will not opt in to any future proposal in Brussels that could lead to an EU scheme being imposed on us, if they have not already done so&#151;I fear they have. If the Government will not accept the amendment, will they at least give that undertaking, and if not, why not?
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>I am sorry to have spent so much time on this amendment, but I have done so to show how entwined we already are in the tentacles of Brussels on the issue of identity cards, as, indeed, we now are for the majority of our national legislation. Noble Lords will remember that before the last general election, Michael Howard said that in the event of victory the Conservatives would make changes to our systems of dealing with asylum and illegal immigration, only to be told by the EU Commission that he was out of order and that the UK Government were not longer free to do so, having ceded control of those areas under Title IV of the TEC and subsequent Council decisions. It is the same picture that we are looking at today.
</p>

<a name="60130-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Those appear to be the waters through which we are now navigating, and I do not see why this situation should be much different. I do not pretend to have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_85"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

understood the whole picture, which is unusually complex, perhaps deliberately so. But I am reasonably sure of one thing: if we stay in the European Union, the United Kingdom will end up as part of an EU ID card system, controlled eventually by Brussels, and there will be nothing that this Parliament, as opposed to the government of the day, will have been able to do about it. In the mean time, I look forward to the Minister&#039;s reply to the questions I have put to her, in the hope that her answers may help to stave off the fate that, I fear, otherwise awaits us. I beg to move.

<a name="60130-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, one does not have to agree with all the views of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, to be grateful to him for his detailed and tenacious consideration of these complex issues. In the thickets of European law, he is a rare forester. I am as intrigued as he is to know whether the central questions he raised&#151;namely, is the game up and are we now subject to whatever the EU may decide for us <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> our ID card system?&#151;are right or wrong.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="60130-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, we should be indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, for his research into the possibilities of an ID card being imposed on us by the European Union whether we like it or not. Everything he said is true. We simply have to look at the history of the European Union to know that things do not proceed in huge leaps or jumps, but by ratchet. That is precisely what the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has been describing tonight: the EU ratchet. The EU realises that if it jumps and leaps about, it frightens people, but it can do things by stealth because EU decision-making is so complex that people do not understand it. It becomes so difficult that even Members of Parliament in both Houses do not know what is happening and, as it is so complicated, they often do not even read what they are being asked to decide upon, after it has been agreed in Brussels by unanimity or by qualified-majority voting. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is absolutely right in pointing out, yet again, that once Ministers have made a decision in Brussels, and once the 22 nations, by qualified majority, have imposed a directive on the European Union, neither this House, the House of Commons, nor anybody else has any power to change that. It has to be accepted whether we like it or not. That is why we must be doubly indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, for bringing this before us so that we can make it absolutely clear to the House that if the Government go along the lines that he has outlined, and agree or have it imposed on them by a qualified majority vote, neither the House of Commons nor this House will be able to do anything about it.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I believe that the Government already intend that there should be an EU identity card. It will be a standard card, and the biometrics and the other information that will be on it will eventually be dictated by the European Union, probably by a qualified majority vote. I say that because only last year the Home Secretary told the Home Affairs Committee that he looked forward to the day when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_86"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there would be a usable EU identity card. He did not say that it would be compulsory, but he said that it would be used throughout the European Union.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is right to be suspicious, as is this House. The House of Commons should also be suspicious, because the matter, I believe, has already been secretly decided, and this Bill is part of the stealth towards an eventual European Union identity card.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I know that the noble Baroness and her colleague the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will strenuously deny that that will happen, but in my time in both Houses of Parliament I have heard so many denials that have eventually proved to be completely and utterly misguided and wrong that I shall continue to be suspicious of whatever reply I receive from the noble Baroness, because I believe that it has already been decided that we shall have an EU identity card eventually.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60130-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Stoddart, know, all passports in Europe at the moment have &quot;European Union&quot; on the front cover and the inside cover in 12 languages. The problem now is in how many other languages it will be. We will have sovereignty over our own passports. The problem is not the passport, but the identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I have already received representations from Italy, France and Germany opposing wholeheartedly the full flat-out gallop at which we are going in this direction, way ahead of anyone else. The Germans do not like it at all and have suggested that the Commission may get hold of this idea before long, and in the interests of something else ask for an exchange of information from the identity register.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>This country has a good passport office. It went through a bad time for a while, but it is probably the best in the world at the moment. There is a certain friendliness and a welcoming approach among our immigration officers. Perhaps they have a new instruction to be friendly. There are differences, however. I return to Germany, which has the biggest single population&#151;80 million or so&#151;in the EU. As noble Lords may be aware, passports in Germany are issued with identity cards by the <i>Oberb&#252;rgermeister</i>&#151;the mayor. It is a regional and a local activity; it is not centralised. Part of the Germans&#039; fear is that information will be centralised, and they will strongly oppose any activity of the sort that might happen in Brussels.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I must not refer to my Italian friends as wops, because I have done that before. Noble Lords will be fully aware that &quot;wop&quot; is not an insulting word. It was introduced when we invaded Italy in the Second World War when the <i>fascisti</i> threw away their papers. They were named &quot;without papers&quot;&#151;they were wops. A great advantage of our democracy is that we are not frightened about being without papers. We may be wops, but we are who we are, and long may we remain so.

Noble Lords will be aware of the recent ministerial decision, approved unanimously at an EU conference in Manchester last year, setting out four &quot;ambitious targets&quot; for European e-government by 2010. Item four of those targets calls on member states to work towards,

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, for trying to lead us through this labyrinth of complexities. To cut to the chase, the question is that put by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. We want assurance on whether the game is up and what further steps, if any, must be taken before we enter a Europe-wide identity cards scheme. As my noble friend said, our previous debate continued late into the night and into the morning. We have subsequently had a chance to look further at what the Minister said. I hope that she can respond particularly with regard to the fact that my noble friend was unable to refer to the protocol the last time. I suspect that she will express the same objective but I hope that she can give us a further explanation.

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="60130-24_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, for outlining with his usual clarity why he feels that there should be anxiety&#151;nay, alarm&#151;about the current position. I am not at all surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, says that it does not really matter what we say, he will never be reassured anyway. With that as a background, I shall clarify the position as best I can.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, probably already knows the answers that I will give, but I will give them for the record. When the noble Lord last spoke on this matter, he focused on the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. His comments in that regard were coloured a little by his failure to differentiate between the arrangements proposed in the constitution, which was not proceeded with, and the prevailing situation.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Amendment No. 111A seeks to state in primary legislation that it is for Parliament to decide whether an identity card scheme, be it voluntary or compulsory, should be introduced into the UK. The amendment makes similar statements on who should be required to possess an ID card and the security standards required for both the ID card and the register.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I hardly need to say it, but Parliament is sovereign. Unless and until primary legislation concerning ID cards is brought before this Parliament, there will be no ID cards scheme in the United Kingdom. This Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_88"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is that primary legislation. We have debates on whether the scheme should be compulsory or voluntary, but there is no debate that this Bill will bring in the ID cards scheme if this Parliament determines that that should occur. It is strange and, if I may respectfully say so, unnecessary to state in a Bill that is before Parliament the fact that Parliament is sovereign over the subject matter to which the Bill relates.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Although Parliament will prescribe, by way of affirmative order, the information to be recorded on ID cards and the format of that information, the security standards of ID cards and of the register will not be set out in legislation. It would be inappropriate to release details of the security standards required for ID cards or the register into the public domain. I hope that noble Lords will concur with the reasons for that. To do so may compromise the future security and integrity of the register itself, giving potential wrongdoers a good place to start when looking for ways to attack the register.


</p>

<a name="60130-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Subsection (2) of the amendment seeks to prevent any international body imposing conditions on any UK citizen to attend any place for the purpose of the issue of an identity card unless this has been agreed to by a UK statute. Subsection (3) of the amendment seeks to prevent any Minister entering into an undertaking with the EU to introduce an ID card scheme in the UK, or agreeing any common standards in relation to such a scheme, unless Royal Assent has been given to the Identity Cards Bill or any other statute for that specific purpose.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>As I stated on previous occasions, and more recently in my letter of 10 January&#151;which has been quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch&#151;the Government&#039;s position is that there is no question of identity cards being introduced by fiat from Brussels. We very much doubt, as the noble Lord has set out from my letter, that the treaties could provide a legal basis for so doing. Even if&#151;which once again we doubt&#151;it could be argued that Title 4 could provide a treaty base, the United Kingdom would be bound by such a measure only if it opted into it. Notwithstanding what the noble Lord has said in relation to that, I think that even he accepts that we would have to opt in in order for it to apply. He, of course, says that we may be minded at some stage to do so. But there is no indication of that and, unless and until we opt in, we would not be so bound. In any event, in so far as there is any scope for making such arguments, restating parliamentary sovereignty in the Bill does not change the position. I hope that I have been able to assure noble Lords about that.

ID cards to come to this country. It is in our interests to make sure that the provisions which apply to ID cards are secure and safe for those who come to this country because we have to rely on the integrity of their documents because they are the ones they choose to use.
</p>

<a name="60130-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>This was requested by the Hague programme and the July 2005 Justice and Home Affairs Council because national ID cards are acknowledged to be the least secure of the identity and travel documents which are commonly used in the EU. It is in the interests of all of us that ID cards are as secure as possible. The council conclusions do not and cannot impose any obligation on states to introduce ID cards if they do not already have them. That is the case, for instance, in Latvia, Denmark and Ireland as well as the United Kingdom.

It will be this Parliament which determines whether ID cards will be introduced; it will be this Parliament which decides the conditions which apply; and it will be this Parliament which says yea or nay to their introduction&#151;and no other.

<a name="60130-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, and before I reply and decide what to do with the amendment, can she therefore give the House a clear assurance that Her Majesty&#039;s Government have not opted&#151;and will never opt&#151;into any measure which could lead to the United Kingdom being included in any EU identity card system? I ask her that very simple question.

But I am, unfortunately, old enough to recognise the ploy when I see it. It is a trap into which I do not intend to fall.

I should tell the noble Baroness that I am not confused about that. I am much clearer about the position of the constitution than I am about the detail of this amendment. I have based my remarks on the current arrangement, as I said on the previous occasion, which is the TEC as amended by various treaties, ending with the Treaty of Nice.

I am saying that, but my own position is that I think we have already gone too far, especially if the Luxembourg court eventually supports Brussels in the adoption of an EU card system&#151;which, of course, it will.

(d)   to make special provision (including exemption) for those who by reason of disability or other good reason may be unable to do or disadvantaged in doing what otherwise may be required of them under any such order or regulation.&quot;

<p><a name="st_193"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 114A seeks to amend Clause 41, which deals with the orders and regulations to be passed under the Bill. The amendment would add paragraph (d) to Clause 41(4). The wording of the amendment would make it abundantly clear that those with any kind of disability or disadvantage may be differently treated under the provisions of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>I am well aware that Clause 41(4) already allows for the Secretary of State, or whoever else is making the regulations and orders, to make different provisions for different cases. Furthermore, in one of the subsections, the clause makes allowance for exemptions to be made with regard to such regulations or orders. This is a belt and braces amendment. It is advanced at the behest of a number of the disability NGOs, which want to be absolutely clear beyond peradventure that their members and beneficiaries will be treated fairly and justly. I am thinking, for example, of Clause 5(5), which will require citizens to attend at a certain place or time; to have fingerprints or other biometric information taken and recorded; to allow themselves to be photographed and so on. That is one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_91"></a>

of the very many requirements that the Bill places on citizens. No explanation is required to understand that some groups will be extremely anxious about what they might be required to do. I will not press the amendment. I accept that on one reading of Clause 41(4) it is wholly superfluous, and I hope that the Minister can say with untrammelled certainty that it is wholly superfluous, whereupon that will be the end of it.

<a name="60130-25_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I speak in support of Amendment 114A to which I have added my name. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, for tabling it. It was a very crafty move to have this debate at this stage of the Bill, particularly for me, as it means that I can ask questions that were central to my Amendment No. 45 that I did not move on day two of Report because of time considerations. That is flannel for saying that I was trying to get to a vote at the right time.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>I did not move the amendment then. I apologised to the Royal National Institute for the Blind and said that I would ensure that I found a way of raising the issues, if only by bringing the matter back on Third Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, has made sure that I do not need to go to Third Reading but can dispose of matters today. I have, therefore, given advance notice of my questions to the Government in the hope that all will be resolved.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>In Committee on 12 December (at cols. 1052 to 1058 of the <i>Official Report</i>) I signalled my concern about the burdens that could be imposed on disabled and vulnerable people as a result of the process that they will have to follow and the Clause 5 issues, to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips referred&#151;being enrolled on the national identity register. I said that I would refer back to the RNIB to ask whether the Minister&#039;s response had fully satisfied it on its concerns. I did just that, but the institute felt that it would be helpful if the Minister could give some further clarification.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>First, will the Minister establish who is eligible for enrolment in the ID cards scheme at home or through a mobile enrolment centre as a result of being unable to travel independently to an enrolment centre? In Committee on 12 December (at col. 1055 of the <i>Official Report</i>) the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton said that disabled and older people who were unable because of their impairment to travel to an enrolment centre could enrol for the ID cards scheme through a home visit or a mobile enrolment centre.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>RNIB said that that was a welcome statement of the general provision that the Government envisage as being necessary to meet the needs of older and disabled people who are unable to travel independently to an enrolment centre. However, the Minister also stated that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a>&quot;it is planned that no person should have to travel any further than an hour from their home . . . This approach is in line with existing policy for similar requirements; for example, appointments for the Department for Work and Pensions. Additionally, for remote <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_92"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>communities and those with mobility problems, mobile enrolment solutions as well as home visits are being considered&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/12/05; col. 1032.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I am concerned that an hour represents a significant length of journey, especially for an older or disabled person. Therefore, I welcome any additional detail that the Minister can give regarding whether the Government plan to establish eligibility criteria for home or mobile registration, setting out who will qualify for those services, which he said are being considered for older and disabled people. For example, will eligibility for those registration options be restricted to those disabled people who claim disability living allowance or attendance allowance, or will older and disabled people be able to request a home registration appointment without having to produce evidence that they have an impairment that makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult to travel up to an hour to a registration centre? If eligibility criteria are to be used in determining who will qualify for home or mobile registration, we are keen to know what those criteria will be, in case they unreasonably restrict assistance and force some older or disabled people to travel up to an hour to an enrolment centre.
</p>

<a name="60130-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Because these are somewhat detailed issues, I gave advance notice. I hope that the Minister can clarify matters today.

</p>

<a name="60130-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is right in his interpretation of Clause 41(4). I confirm that his amendment is entirely superfluous. The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make exemptions in the cases to which he alluded.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Officials from the ID cards programme met the RNIB on 2 December. The meeting was extremely productive, as ever, and the RNIB agreed to send the ID cards team its findings on how its members coped with the roll out of chip and pin to further understand the needs of disabled users of the ID card scheme. The next meeting with the RNIB is planned for March/April this year, and we intend to continue with this valuable dialogue both on policy and the technical side of matters.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The ID cards programme will continue to engage with special interest groups, including those representing race, faith and trans-gender groups, and to further investigate the needs of disabled people. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked for specific information. Although she gave advance notice, for which I am grateful, I am not in a position to give specific details, as it is too early in the development of precise exemptions, in particular, and eligibility for home and mobile enrolment centres. I take the point about the hour-long journey. My journey takes me 50 minutes and I travel some 55 to 60 miles, so I understand the point that is being made. We shall have to give some flexible consideration to that.

If I can, I will ensure that we will provide some more information before the Bill moves to another place. However, that may be a tall order because these are difficult and complex issues on which we wish to have detailed discussions with those who have a particular interest. More than that I cannot really say, but your Lordships can rest assured that we are extremely sympathetic with regard to these matters and are concerned to get them right.

<p><a name="st_199"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 116A adds to the definition clause, Clause 43, a definition of the word &quot;consent&quot;, referring to its use in Clause 14. The clause, which is headed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a>&quot;Provision of information for verification or otherwise with consent&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>will allow the Secretary of State to provide a wide range of private sector bodies in due course with information on the register with the consent or authority of the citizen concerned.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>I confess at once that the amendment would be more happily placed in Clause 14 but, given the stage we are at, this was the only way I could see of getting the matter dealt with. The point of defining consent, as the amendment does, is to deal with the debate we had on a previous amendment of mine to which the Government&#039;s response was that they will allow only one consent at a time for information to be provided from an individual&#039;s entry in the register. Bank X, Y or Z could have a specific request to check the identity of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_94"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

customer Smith, and that would be it. The consent would be for one single application by the bank to the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>The language of Clause 14 is not confined to the possibility of a single consent, hence a single application for information. What we have here is the difference between the language of the statute and the policy, as the Government explained it earlier. I am perfectly content, as always, to accept statements of government policy for so long as they are government policy, but that may not be for too long and will certainly not bind a successor. Therefore, Clause 14(1) needs to provide for the possibility of a continuing written consent. I should be able to say to my bank, &quot;You can apply at any time, or until further notice, to my entry on the register to verify this or that&quot;. The language of the statute would permit that, and this amendment makes that plain. That, in turn, leads to the addition to my definition, which says, in effect, that that consent can be in writing withdrawn. I want those issues to be clearly on the face of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>I have a question for the noble Lord and I perfectly understand if he cannot give me an answer tonight. It is about the difference between Clause 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(b). I am wholly unclear about the difference between me, a citizen, giving my bank &quot;authority&quot; to request information and me, a citizen, giving my bank &quot;consent&quot; to request information. If, in giving his reply to the amendment, the noble Lord could clarify that point, he would be doing a service to the House and to those who have to understand the Bill hereafter. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="60130-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I may or may not be able to give the noble Lord an answer to his last question; studying the clause I may pray in aid that I might have to drop him a note, but we shall see. Amendment No. 116A would insert into the general interpretation of the Bill a definition of consent in relation to Clause 14. That would have the effect that all consent must be written and that consent can be singular&#151;on one occasion only&#151;or continuing. Continuing consent may be cancelled, which would also have to be carried out in writing.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>It is our intention that, if not all, the majority of checks under Clause 14 should be carried out on a singular basis&#151;that is, consent is given for a check on any one occasion. We do not wish that consent to have to be expressed in writing, as that would be bureaucratic and, in our view, cumbersome. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, is against things that are cumbersome, and he certainly does not like much about bureaucracy. The provision could have the effect of forcing a person to fill in a form every time&#151;more paper&#151;rather than simply handing over his or her card and asking or agreeing that it be checked.

</p>

<a name="60130-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>On continuing consent I thank the noble Lord for raising an interesting point. On the one hand there might be dangers in allowing for continuing consent, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_95"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but one could argue on the other hand that there would be benefits to cardholders, because it would be easier. I have the view that perhaps checking occasionally is a good thing and that continuing consent runs against that. It is a difficult point on balance. As the noble Lord has raised the matter when he has, we are content to give it some further thought, although I am not going to promise anything.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>The noble Lord asked about authority and consent. A response has been provided and I shall endeavour to enlighten him. I accept that there may be some overlap between authority and consent, but authority is more to cover a person acting on behalf of an individual; for example, a relative or someone with power of attorney. Consent is more for an application made by a third party with the agreement of the individual concerned. Those are the two different instances in which the terminology as it is explained to me has been set out in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>No doubt the noble Lord will want to read that explanation carefully and I think I will too.

<a name="60130-26_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, as always I am grateful to the Minister and I am sorry that I had to raise that nasty question. It sounds to me as though authority is more authoritative. I will read; I do not think that that makes me a happy legislator and maybe in the course of considering whether an amendment is required in respect of continuing consent something can be done to make that a little less opaque. On that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I recall in particular that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who is at the moment not in his seat, argued at Second Reading that the definition of public services was too wide. We have considered the matter and we are persuaded that the existing wording of paragraph (e) <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>We accept that that definition could be interpreted more widely than we had intended and might be read as deeming someone to have complied with a legal requirement when he has not in fact done so. In these cases we need to be able to deal with where, for example, it would be a requirement for individuals to attend a public office to identify themselves. In such circumstances the service could be much wider than what might easily be regarded as a provisional service; for example, an offender who has to report to a police station as a condition of bail or as a condition imposed on certain sex offenders.

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Once identity cards are introduced, and especially when, as we intend, they become compulsory, reporting in such circumstances would seem a clear instance of when an individual could expect to be asked to produce an ID card. The new form of words in Amendment No. 120 is longer, but it is more precise and less open-ended than the existing wording. The main point is that it is now sufficient for the purpose of ensuring that the definition of &quot;public service&quot; covers the circumstances where reporting conditions have been imposed. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="60130-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon </b>   moved Amendment No. 120A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"></a>Page 39, line 15, leave out &quot;Cards&quot; and insert &quot;Register&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is probably an extraordinarily simple amendment, but it has an ulterior motive that is absolutely clear. I want to try to get us back on the right track. Identity cards for some purposes are a good thing. If that were made clear, life might be a little bit easier. But the identity register, if it is not correctly understood and correctly produced to the nation, is a bad thing. If you mix good with bad, you get something indifferent. So my proposal is that this Bill, as I suggested on 15 November and other noble Lords suggested at various times during its passage, should not be known as the Identity Cards Bill, but simply as the Identity Register Bill. Whether that register will prove to be a good thing over time is another matter, but one of the difficulties that we have had during the passage of this Bill is in distinguishing between compulsory and voluntary. If we pursued the voluntary objective, we would find much more support than we do at the moment with the fear of a register. This fear is more international than national. Other countries are seen not to have the same obligations as us.
</p>

<a name="60130-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I therefore suggest to the Minister and her colleagues that if they simply change &quot;cards&quot; to &quot;register&quot; in the Title of the Bill, it would be more accurate. In order to be sure about this, I rang one of my old English dons and asked whether he would be kind enough to read it through. In my university days, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_97"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 97</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we would often be asked to pr&#233;cis large texts, sometimes to not more than a quarter of their original length, and sometimes to only three words. This Bill would be better if it was known as the Identity Register Bill rather than the Identity Cards Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="60130-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I am an inadequate replacement for the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. Perhaps I may pay tribute to him at the end of this Report stage for his indefatigable work on the Bill. He has pursued the Government into all sorts of labyrinthine mechanisms during its passage, almost accepting its principle. I couple that with my admiration for the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the Ministers, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, and the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for their work.
</p>

<a name="60130-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I am ultimately unconvinced by the basic principle of this Bill. This amendment echoes the one that I moved at the beginning of Committee which would have replaced the national identity register with a national surveillance register. That is what this Bill is all about. If one looks at the index to the various sections, one sees that few entries refer to the identity card as such, and that almost all of them are concerned with the register, access to it, the information that is stored on it and the information that comes out of it.
</p>

<a name="60130-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>It is a grossly intrusive Bill which will cost an awful lot of money and eventually will not be successful. I wait to see it fail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="60130-27_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I was intrigued that my noble friend seemed able to find a new way of trying to alter the Title of a Bill as I was aware that one was unable, by ordinary amendments, to change the Title itself. The noble Lord has delivered an opportunity to the Government to accept that the purpose of the Bill is indeed a national identity register. He delivered his explanation with admirable brevity. He is seeking to make sure that the Bill does what it says on the tin: it is all about a register.
</p>




<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="60130-27_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his kind invitation. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, although salutations of that sort do not normally come at this stage. But I welcome them gratefully from the noble Lord. The short answer to &quot;the Identity Cards Bill&quot; is that that is how the public generally see it. It is about identity cards. I hear, of course, what the noble Lord says, that the register is of importance. I do not disagree with him. But the primary importance remains as described on the tin: the Identity Cards Bill. Therefore, as inviting as his invitation is to dance, on this occasion I have to decline.
</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="60130-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry, I am totally tone-deaf and I cannot really dance. But I did win the dancing prize for waltz at my prep school with Francis Woodhouse, who could only go backwards and I could only go forwards. Taking that as a guide, and listening to what has been said, I cannot agree with the noble Baroness that this is about identity cards that everybody wants. The Government have not presented <br>&nbsp;<br>

things quite as clearly as they should and I would like to test the opinion of the House, even if there are only one or two people who want to vote for it. There is a point of principle here. If you believe that the description of something is wrong, you should point it out. The description of this Bill, as it is now, is wrong. I would therefore like to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="60130-27_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Noakes </b>   moved Amendment No. 121:


</p>

<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="60130-28_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk </b>   moved Amendment No. 121A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100"></a>Page 39, line 18, at beginning insert &quot;Subject to subsection (3A),&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_214"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 121A, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 122A. The Government Front Bench will be only too well aware of my habit of seeking to debate what may appear to be arcane issues. Indeed, the Minister made oblique reference to this earlier in proceedings. Be that as it may, the technical standards directives appear to be relevant here. Helpfully, TRIS&#151;the acronym for the technical regulations information system of the Enterprise Directorate-General of the European Commission&#151;publishes an idiot&#039;s guide to the procedure to be adopted in respect of draft technical regulations concerning information society services. This outlines a series of tests to be carried out on a member state&#039;s draft legislative proposals, to see if they should be notified to the Commission. By my interpretation, the Bill satisfies these.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>Here, I should once again express my gratitude to the Minister for her commentary on the point in her letter of 11 January. I do not dispute that Directive 98/34/EC, as she says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"></a>&quot;is aimed at barriers to trade which result from technical regulations relating to products&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>That said, I wonder if the noble Baroness has fully taken on board the effect of the amending directive, 94/98/EC, which adds &quot;information society services&quot; to the scope of the procedure. Crucially, albeit that the Bill is substantially an enabling measure, in its first phase it gives effect to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a>&quot;an information society service, that is to say any service normally provided for a remuneration at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>On the face of it, therefore, the Bill should be notified to the Commission.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>I doubt that the Government will share my view. With that in mind, and in the spirit of helpfulness, I propose to advance what might be a more persuasive justification for the amendment. The Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_100"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have been keen to argue that their proposals are not unique and that, in fact, there is a pan-European if not global move towards the establishment of biometric standards of identity verification. That raises the serious issue of the extent to which our UK identity system will be interoperable and compatible with equivalent arrangements elsewhere in the world. For my part, I would not favour that acting as a precursor for routine data sharing between countries; that would be unacceptable. But in respect of law enforcement, and given the global nature of terrorism, built-in interoperability and compatibility would be beneficial.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The Government might seek to argue that that is indeed the intention of their proposals for passports and that the trend is towards international standardisation, but passport regimes around the world are being developed in a piecemeal fashion. At least in part, that is a function of the ICAO&#039;s standard. The LSE report observes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a>&quot;In attempting to accommodate flexibility for the varying demands of the member states of the ICAO working groups, the ICAO subverted its primary goal of interoperability&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>Nor is the supposed EU standard being rolled out on a consistent basis. My noble friend Lord Selsdon alluded to that last week. For example, Denmark has indeed implemented biometric passports but, in contrast to the scheme envisaged here, the biometric is limited to a digital photograph and is stored on a chip in the passport rather than on a central register.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The pan-European context here is particularly important. We have already debated the substance of this matter under the umbrella of Amendment No. 111A. In that context, I merely say that if I am uncomfortable about the scheme proposed in this Bill, I am even less enamoured of a system devised for the whole EU. Nevertheless, that would seem to be what we are committed to by virtue of the ministerial decision. That being so, it is incumbent on the Government to make use of the technical standards procedure to guarantee appropriate levels of mutuality and interoperability between this scheme and those of our European partners.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The global context is equally pertinent. Here it is interesting to note that Cal Slemp, vice-president and global leader for security and privacy services at IBM Global Services, has suggested that there is a requirement for wider international co-operation and a common language and standards in respect of IAM&#151;that is, identity and access management. In commenting about the current state of play, he says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a>&quot;we&#039;ve got inconsistent and incomplete implementation and also no standard approach to the future nor a target to shoot at&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Yet the Bill is silent on that point&#151;or, rather, it appears to assume that it is appropriate that the scheme be developed in isolation from what is happening elsewhere in the world, let alone on our own doorstep in Europe. That is all the more reason for the Bill to be subject to the technical standards procedure as a means of ensuring consistency of approach to a European level and furthering deeper standardisation globally. After all, that is the stated purpose of the notification process: it seeks,

<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="60130-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, for drawing the European Union directive on technical standards to my attention a second time. The amendments under consideration now were proposed but not moved in Committee and I commented on their substance when I wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on 11 January. Therefore, I am pleased to provide a fuller answer now.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>We do not consider that the directive is relevant to the Bill now under consideration. It is intended to promote the smooth functioning of the internal market, as the noble Earl knows, and relates to national initiatives for the establishment of technical standards or regulations. The Bill sets out no such standards.
</p>

<a name="60130-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I am sure your Lordships are aware that Article 1(9) of the directive specifically excludes public procurement tender specifications. The identity cards programme is currently engaged in preparations for the public procurement exercise that will be carried out according to the relevant European Union requirements for procurement. It is possible that some of the detailed secondary legislation to be drawn up during the implementation of the scheme may engage the provisions of the directive, which is something that we shall examine carefully. However, should that be the case, I am happy&#151;delighted, I should say&#151;to assure the noble Earl that the due process required by the directive will be complied with. For those reasons, I hope that he will feel content to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="60130-28_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. I am conscious that this is our last amendment to debate on the Bill today and that the House wishes to move on to other business. I shall further consider the Government&#039;s position and reflect on how I might wish to develop the matter once I have had the opportunity to study the <i>Official Report</i>. At the moment I have no wish to protract our proceedings, and therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

As the noble Lord the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms is in his place, perhaps I may say on behalf of other colleagues that this is very unsatisfactory. I know the noble Lord will agree. We realise that there are difficulties in timetabling, but this has happened two days running, and to start at quarter to nine at night is not helpful at all.

<a name="60130-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   For the sake of accuracy, we did not start at quarter to nine on the first day. As the noble Baroness will recall, there were delays on the first day, but what will appear in <i>Hansard</i>, unless I correct it, will suggest that we started at quarter to nine on both days, which she will acknowledge is incorrect. While I am on my feet, I am sure she will also acknowledge that it is not entirely within my control or anyone else&#039;s how long debates take.
</p>




<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for coming back. I think it was about seven o&#039;clock that night. It was certainly late when we started. I cannot remember; it is a minor point. We had virtually three hours&#039; work

<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. I agree with the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, about the unsatisfactory timing. I understand that the length of debates is not always within the Government&#039;s control. However, through the usual channels, they can control when matters are timetabled. I believe I am correct in saying that for two more Committee days this Bill is timetabled after other Bills. It is really unsatisfactory for the flow of the Bill in Committee to have only an hour and a quarter before we stop again. It is difficult to get into the flow if this is how we are to deal with it every day. I want to register the opinion of those on these Benches in that respect. I also want to put on record that, when a Bill is pushed further and further back and points take a long time, noble Lords want to make substantial contributions at Committee <br>&nbsp;<br>

stage and question the Minister, there is a tendency to feel that they should hurry because of time constraints. That is not acceptable at Committee stage.

<a name="60130-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   If the Bill had been dealt with in Grand Committee, as I believe it should have been, none of those problems would have arisen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I take that point, but there are quite a few noble Lords sitting on the Benches. I believe that last time we debated the Bill there were about 20 noble Lords present.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   There were 40 noble Lords.
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   To put 40 noble Lords in the Moses Room is not an ideal situation. That is enough. We are moving more into the twilight hours. Let us begin.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Amendment No. 111 is a probing amendment. It is based on what we see as a potential conflict between the purpose given to Natural England and the remit of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. On page 2, Natural England is given a general purpose which is then expanded to include five aims. Those aims are not ranked explicitly, but they seem to have some sort of logical progression in descending order of gravity. I know we debated this matter at a previous stage. The first aim has two distinct parts: to promote nature conservation and to protect biodiversity. They are not the same thing, but the implication is that they are to run side by side.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>On page 11 of the Bill, Natural England is classified as one of the UK conservation bodies, each of which, in conjunction with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is then charged with duties relating to nature conservation and to fostering the understanding of nature conservation. In discharging their duties, each party must have regard to ecological changes and to sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>There is no reference there to protecting biodiversity and, we believe, that having regard to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_110"></a>&quot;actual or possible ecological changes&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>is weaker than the wording of the aim. The danger of conflict is made worse by the fact that the aim is not part of the Bill for the remaining UK countries and there is no guarantee that any of them will adopt it. In such cases we suggest that there is a finite risk that English Nature&#039;s stance in the JNCC may, from time to time, be at odds with its partners and, we believe, unnecessarily so. Our proposal would confine Natural England&#039;s nature conservation duties to those specified under the terms of the JNCC. Perhaps the Minister will tell us who is top dog&#151;I use that expression as I cannot think of a better one. Which is the most important, the JNCC or Natural England? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. It makes more sense for the general purposes of Natural England, if that is its title. I doubt <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_105"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether it should be and I hope that we may do something about it at a later stage of the Bill. More importantly, the general purposes outlined in this clause are, in my view, deficient. Amendment No. 112, which follows this amendment in the Marshalled List, was debated a few evenings ago. It seems to me that this amendment is helpful and well designed. It certainly merits support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   This group of amendments is another example of the fact that this clause is not drafted satisfactorily. Certainly, we on these Benches have considerable concerns over the phrase &quot;promoting nature conservation and protecting biodiversity&quot; in Clause 2(1)(a) The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said that they were not the same thing. I do not believe that they are. The Minister no doubt has a definition of each.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>I recall that, on the previous Committee day, we were discussing the parallels between Natural England and the JNCC in terms of sustainable development and those duties. The Minister said that they do not have exactly the same duties and, therefore, the same words need not apply to each. Our amendment is designed to focus the duty of Natural England more accurately on biodiversity. Although the Minister may have a satisfactory definition for it, &quot;nature conservation&quot; is a fairly misunderstood and sloppy term compared with the wording suggested in our amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="60130-29_spnew12"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 116, which stands in my name and is grouped with Amendment No. 111.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Inadvertently, I failed to declare an interest when I first spoke in Committee the other day. I own land in the north of England, mostly moorland and mostly subject to agricultural tenancies.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I apologise if it will take a little longer at this late hour, but I need to explain to your Lordships exactly what I am trying to achieve. Amendment No. 116 would put a statutory obligation on Natural England to address the UK&#039;s obligations on the sustainable use of natural resources under the 1992 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. I am sure the Minister will point out that, under Clause 40, there is an obligation for government departments to have regard to the convention. Clearly, that is not the same as having a statutory obligation to abide by it. If Natural England is to wholeheartedly commit itself to sustainable management of wildlife resources&#151;that is the important phrase&#151;then an adherence to the convention should be mandatory. Furthermore, it could probably be argued that, by failing to support the principles behind the convention, the Government run the risk of undermining the internationally agreed conservation goal of sustainable use, and even appearing to condone the non-sustainable use of such resources.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Without going into the convention in too much detail, there are one or two key issues on which I shall focus. As a general point, wildlife legislation has tended to concentrate too much on a purely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_106"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

protectionist stance. We need to move to a more positive position, whereby active conservation becomes more prevalent and reflects more realistically the principles of sustainable use.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>My amendment specifically refers to Article 6 of the convention. However, the wording of that article is such that it covers the measures set out in the convention as a whole. It would therefore include an obligation under Article 10, for example, to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_111"></a>&quot;support local populations&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>when I talk about &quot;local&quot;, I mean &quot;human&quot;&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_112"></a>&quot;to develop and implement remedial action in degraded areas where biological diversity has been reduced&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113"></a>&quot;encourage co-operation between its governmental authorities and its private sector in developing methods for sustainable use of biological resources&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>There is a greater need for government and their agencies to appreciate the role that the private sector can and, indeed, does play in enhancing biodiversity objectives and to work more closely toward that aim. To that end, article 8 includes the objective to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_114"></a>&quot;respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovation and practices of indigenous and local communities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>That, again, reflects the fact that local experience and wisdom should be harnessed more effectively to obtain common objectives in wildlife management.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>I recognise that the UK Government have started down the road with their biodiversity action plans for species of conservation concern, but they are not quite as effective as they might be. Their approach is, if I may use the term, rather bland. Furthermore, conservation organisations such as the wildlife trusts and the RSPB have been channelling funds for specific conservation via their nature reserves&#151;whereby the public pay in return for access&#151;which has resulted in positive examples of wildlife management. One good example is the successful osprey breeding programme at Loch Garten.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>A further example of such sustainable wildlife benefits comes indirectly&#151;and here I declare an interest&#151;from grouse moors management. I apologise to those of your Lordships who may have heard me mention these statistics before in debate on the Commons Bill, but they are very important. On the managed moors of the north Pennines, we have in the region of 3,900 pairs of curlew whereas, elsewhere, their numbers appear to be quite unsustainable. Indeed, in the Berwyn SPA in Wales, the number is down to a mere 35 pairs.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Similarly, golden plover populations on the two Pennine SPAs amount to some 2,150 pairs&#151;in areas managed for grouse&#151;whereas the population in the whole of Wales appears now to have slumped to a mere 85 pairs. That clearly represents a non-sustainable management regime. Positive management is required to try and rectify those ever falling wader populations. A similar report has been produced on Dartmoor, where the golden plover and green plover populations are literally falling out of bed. If that continues along current lines, they will cease to exist there, so positive management is required.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_107"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 107</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>This amendment is not simply about conserving biodiversity: it promotes the sustainable use of biodiversity via active species management. All wildlife in this country owes its position to man&#039;s involvement, and wildlife management must be seen as part of our conservation effort, not separate from it. I should add that that would include flora as well as fauna. One clear example; if we want to encourage bluebells into woodlands it requires a certain type of woodland management through coppicing which would, again, require the careful management of deer.
</p>

<a name="60130-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>There is a real need for more pragmatic and positive moves toward sustainable wildlife objectives, involving all parties in a more constructive dialogue and a realistic approach. This amendment, which simply incorporates into law the United Nations convention on the sustainable use of biodiversity, would go some way toward meeting those objectives. In the parliamentary briefing for the Bill, the three organisations that will form part of Natural England stated that they want to achieve,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_115"></a>&quot;a clear general purpose that should be enabling rather than prescriptive, inclusive rather than narrow and forward-looking rather than retrospective&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-29_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I suggest that this amendment would greatly enhance the prospects of such objectives being achieved. To do its job effectively, Natural England should have a statutory duty to develop wildlife policies that are sustainable in the long term. That has to embrace positive wildlife management, which must include the word &quot;use&quot;. That is crucial.

<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="60130-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I support my noble friend Lady Byford. Last time we were in Committee, the Minister gave me a definition of conserving and enhancing. He said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_116"></a>&quot;conserving means protecting from harm or destruction&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 24/1/06; col. 1129.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I hope that I do not get noble Lords in a muddle because I seem to get in a big muddle when I go through this. I think that that definition is wrong because when one looks it up in a dictionary, conserving means protecting from harm, decay and loss. If conserving is stopping decay, then it is unnatural in many ways. Clause 2(2)(a) includes &quot;promoting&quot;, and the definition of promoting is subtly different. It is encouraging the process or existence. While &quot;conserving&quot; is rather like conserving jam in a jar and all the substance is there, &quot;promoting&quot; is allowing the natural progression of evolution. With climatic change, and while we are talking about a vibrant, living, ever-changing environment, I do not think the two words fit well alongside each other. I hope that we will come back to these arguments later on.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>I do not think I am nitpicking on this. In my dealings with English Nature, I have been somewhat muddled. English Nature wished to carry out scientific enhancement of a particular SSSI woodland, of which I am a caretaker, although that science was not proven. It felt that enhancing the area was better than conserving it. The difference was that it cut down well <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_108"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 108</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

over 50 mature areas in a SSSI in order to enhance it. English Nature may be right or wrong, but the definitions are not clearly defined. If there were better definition, there would be less argument and confrontation between clients, owners or caretakers and English Nature.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>My noble friend Lady Byford also talked about the question of who has the ultimate say: the JNCC or Natural England. That point is relevant when deciding whether conserving or enhancing is more important. Will the Minister look carefully at these words that sit alongside each other? Perhaps he could come back with a changed wording so that there is less ambiguity when there is a confrontation between Natural England and the client or the caretaker.


</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="60130-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I added my name to Amendment No. 116 simply to ask for clarification, which I hope will be forthcoming. As we have just heard, Natural England will have the general purpose of protecting biodiversity under subsection (2)(a) of this general purpose clause.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>In the very helpful letter that the Minister sent to us all on 19 January, in which he drew our attention to Clause 40 on the duty to conserve biodiversity, he points out that in complying with the purpose of conserving&#151;not protecting, as in the general purpose clause&#151;the Minister of the Crown, a government department or the National Assembly for Wales must have particular regard to the 1992 convention. He continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_117"></a>&quot;it would be wrong to expect all 388 principal local authorities to be fully conversant with the 1992 convention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>I understand that, but the local authorities are mentioned in Clause 40. They are a public authority, so they have the duty to conserve biodiversity. The Minister need not reply; it would be easier to write to us to explain how the general purpose of protecting biodiversity runs alongside the duty to conserve in Clause 40, and the particular requirement for certain of the public authorities to have regard to the 1992 convention. It is a little confusing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="60130-30_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Carter, has made an interesting point. My amendment would apply only to Natural England. It would not apply to local authorities or more widely, so the added bureaucracy to which the Minister&#039;s letter referred would not apply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="60130-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Grantchester: </b>   I, too, rise to speak to Amendment No. 116. As this is the first time that I have spoken in Committee, I declare my interest as a dairy farmer in Cheshire and as a director of the farmers co-operative, Dairy Farmers of Britain. I am grateful to Dr Stephen Tapper of the Game Conservancy Trust for his advice on this matter.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Following on from my noble friend Lord Carter and the very helpful response from the noble Earl, Lord Peel, I, too, believe that it is important that the sustainable use of biological resources is added to Natural England&#039;s list of purposes, and in accordance with the general principles that are agreed internationally. Although Ministers and their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_109"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

departments have signed up to the convention, it could be argued that this would be a hollow agreement if it were not adhered to by the agency most empowered to act in this arena.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Following the line taken by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, the amendment is pertinent to Natural England and in no way places further bureaucratic burdens on other public bodies. Nor does it expect all 388 principal local authorities to be conversant with international treaties. Internationally, the sustainable use of natural resources has been a key conservation concept ever since the world conservation strategy in 1980 and as recently as the Addis Ababa principles and guidelines for the sustainable use of biodiversity. The sustainable use of wildlife has yet to be properly addressed in UK legislation. Should not Natural England&#039;s general purpose reflect the UK&#039;s obligations on the sustainable use of wildlife?
</p>




<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="60130-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   I sat through our proceedings last week, and was not certain when to make these remarks, which are more general and refer in fact to all these amendments to Clause 2.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>The Minister said in his opening remarks on Clause 2 that the list of activities that fell within the general purpose of the Bill were not necessarily set in stone, but I believe that he also said&#151;I cannot remember his exact words&#151;that the Government had looked at these different interest areas very carefully indeed. I am concerned that the amendments risk upsetting the necessary balance which stems from giving equal weighting to conservation and biodiversity on the one hand and access and recreation on the other and which provides a basis for harmonious working between those different areas.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Work is already been done by the various interest groups, and I shall briefly cite a couple of examples. The Central Council of Physical Recreation is working with English Nature and the Countryside Agency on the Best of Both Worlds project, and the Royal Yachting Association and the British Marine Federation have their Green Blue initiative. The latter includes a strong education element&#151;that is, educating both the boating public and the industry in best environmental practice. It also flags up current examples of good practice and, in addition, provides a useful index of all academic and professional studies on boating and the environment, something from which all sides could gain benefit.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>I hope that Natural England will embrace these existing projects and ensure that such co-operation continues and, indeed, is built on. As the Minister has said already, the board of Natural England will be quite capable of deciding any contentious matters without its hands being tied by weighting towards any particular interest area in this section of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>I make these remarks now because I am conscious that time is moving on. I will not be able to be here when the Committee meets next Wednesday. Therefore, for the reasons I have just mentioned, I should also like to oppose now the inclusion of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

I declare the same interests as I declared at Second Reading in connection with specific wildlife trusts. I also serve as an officer of the all-party group on the matters with which this group of amendments is concerned.
</p>

<a name="60130-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>I declare not so much an interest as, in the light of the speech of my noble friend Lord Peel on his own amendment, a potential appearance on a charge sheet. My noble friend commented on past legislation. I should confess to the Committee that I served as the government Whip on the 1981 Bill. The Committee sat for 105 hours. It was not guillotined in any way and was staffed, on both sides, by MPs who were passionate about the subject. The principal Ministers on the Bill were my noble friends Lord King of Bridgwater and Lord Monro of Langholm. I would simply defend the enthusiasts who staffed both sides of the Committee. They were inevitably representative of that era in the views that they expressed but there was no question at all about the degree of commitment which they showed to the subject.

<a name="60130-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>I have taken an interest in more wildlife trusts than those where I have been resident or have represented as an elected representative in the other place. I am greatly encouraged by their advance across the country in the manner described by my noble friend Lord Peel. As a future mover of an amendment on Clause 40, to which he also referred, I strongly support my noble friend in his salience on these matters much earlier in the Bill.

<a name="60130-31_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  We have had a very interesting debate to start our proceedings today. I think it is doubtful that we will be able to debate Amendment No. 122, although we shall have to see how the time goes. If we do not debate it tonight, surely we should start with it on Wednesday. Let me deal briefly with these important amendments. I agree very much with what the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said in his contribution. I regret that he will not be able to be with us at our next debate.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>It is the Government&#039;s case that Amendment No. 111 would upset the delicate balance of the general purpose clause and would not add anything substantial to it. I can reassure the Committee, if it needs reassuring, that all the major stakeholders have had substantial input into the discussions that have resulted in the general purpose clause as currently drafted in Clause 2. Part of the reason for the choice of words in the clause is to provide continuity with the powers and activities of the predecessor bodies. By way of example, promoting nature conservation has been one of the major activities of English Nature. Although biodiversity is a broad term&#151;and I am not suggesting that Natural England would have been <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_111"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prevented from promoting nature conservation&#151;there is merit for both the staff and customers of Natural England in retaining clear links with the existing words in the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked who was top dog with regard to the various purposes set out in Clause 2(2). As I hoped I had made clear the other day, in our opinion they are not in any particular order. There is no one more important than the other. They are not hierarchical in that sense; they all have equal weight.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Natural England&#039;s general purpose in Clause 2(2) encompasses the JNCC&#039;s functions. It has to pursue certain functions through the JNCC, which is not affected by the list in Clause 2(2)(a) to (e). As to who has the final say&#151;Natural England or the JNCC&#151;it does not work like that. Natural England in common with the Countryside Council for Wales and Scottish Natural Heritage can exercise certain functions only through the JNCC, set out in Clause 34(2). That is a nice question when we reach that clause in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>Natural England&#039;s general work on biodiversity will not be affected by the relationship with the JNCC. To put it another way, Natural England&#039;s work with the JNCC is a narrow part of its role, and will be constrained by the role of the JNCC set out in that part of the Bill because Natural England&#039;s overall role is much broader, and reflected in its purpose. The situation with the other conservation bodies to which I have referred is similar to the one that we propose here.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>We recognise the intent of Amendment No. 113 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but we believe that the wording in the draft clause better expresses the range of topics that Natural England should cover. You cannot promote without protecting. Equally, protecting implies enhancing. Enhancing biodiversity is also a difficult concept, as it could easily be achieved by importing non-native species.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I remind the House that the provisions in Clause 2(2)(a) to (e) are not exclusive but are there only to show some of the things included in the general purpose, such as conserving, enhancing and managing the natural environment. Biodiversity is a core component of the natural environment. The choice of items in subsection (2)(a) to (e) is intended to clarify some of the things that are included in the general purpose, but also to show to staff and customers that some of the main functions and activities of the predecessor bodies have been carried forward. We believe that promoting nature conservation and protecting biodiversity is a good description of one such major area of activity.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The purpose of Natural England is about outcomes that it is there to achieve. We believe that our proposal gives Natural England sufficiently wide powers to further its general purpose, and perhaps to cover the activities that the noble Baroness had in mind.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60130-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We have heard powerful speeches on Amendment No. 116, which was spoken to first by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, and then by other noble Lords. I was not certain whether the intention is to replace subsection (2)(b) with this new one, or whether to add it to the list.
</p>




<p><a name="st_242"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew0"></a><b> A noble Lord: </b>   To add it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   That is rather what we thought. The addition to the general purpose of Natural England, to refer to the Convention on Biological Diversity, as the noble Earl concedes, overlaps with Clauses 41 and 42. While Clauses 40 and 41 do not have the same effect as the intention behind the amendment, our view is that the amendment is still not necessary.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Clause 42 places a specific duty to have regard to the United Nations Environmental Programme Convention on Biological Diversity on Ministers of the Crown and government departments in England, but does not extend to other public bodies. This is because the convention is an international treaty and relates to actions of governments on biodiversity. But since Natural England will have expertise and statutory functions relevant to the convention, Ministers will obviously look to it to deliver many of its obligations in England. I draw the noble Earl&#039;s attention to Clause 41(2), which makes it clear that the Secretary of State must consult Natural England before publishing any list of species of principal importance to the conservation of biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The noble Earl said that the Bill must include positive action to enhance biodiversity. That is included in the general purpose in Clause 2(1), which provides for Natural England to conserve, enhance and manage the natural environment. It is for the board of Natural England to decide precisely how best to enhance biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The points made by the noble Earl and those who support his amendment are important. I want to consider exactly what they have said, without any hint that we might change our minds However, I want to give those well thought-out remarks the respect they deserve. Indeed, it may be possible to debate this again at a later stage in Committee, when we reach Clauses 40 and 41.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am very grateful to the Minister for those helpful remarks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I should like to raise a small point that I failed to raise before. I do not know if the Minister was aware of it, but the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister produced, either today or recently, a planning policy statement on delivering sustainable development. Under the heading:

</p>

<a name="60130-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>Does this mean that the countryside should not be kept in aspect and allowed to evolve in a natural way? As I understand it, the word &quot;conserve&quot; in this Bill means keeping the country as it is, protected in aspect and not allowing it to evolve. The Minister might not want to answer this question until he has seen the statement and, if so, I accept that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   That is very generous of the noble Lord. I will look at the statement and either in the course of the debate or in writing, I will answer his perfectly proper question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_247"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I hope that the Minister will forgive me for intervening yet again, but his response has convinced me that my concern about this particular part of the Bill is correct. He has convinced me that the Bill itself and the purposes of Natural England are looking backwards. We cannot afford to look backwards any longer; we have heard enough today about the problems of global warming, what is likely to happen to the Iceland ice cap, and so on. Those issues are not mentioned but they will cause fundamental and huge problems for our natural England which, if it is allowed to continue, courtesy of some government agency, will not be natural at all.
</p>

<a name="60130-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Fortunately, my next amendment has already been debated; I do not need to say any more except that the Minister has confirmed that there is a need for some urgent discussions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_248"></a>
<a name="60130-31_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Some of the Minister&#039;s remarks were very helpful, and I will read them carefully. On the general purpose, will he enlighten the House about the marine area? That is not mentioned specifically in the Bill, which talks only of landscape and, for a lot of people, the sea does not come under the definition of landscape. English Nature has responsibilities out to a certain limit; are they envisaged to be the same for Natural England, or are the Government considering extending them?

<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Not for the first time the noble Baroness has hit on an interesting and important point. We are speaking in many debates at present about how widely affected marine life will be by the Bill. I do not want to give her any false answers, so if she will give me a little longer to answer her properly, I will.
</p>




<p><a name="st_250"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response. We have started out with an interesting group of three amendments. If I may follow on from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, when we debated the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which was before the Minister&#039;s time in his present position, we realised too late that we should have had a section on marine life within the Bill. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_114"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

House recognised that biodiversity should be included, because we moved an amendment and the Government came back with a replacement amendment, for which we were grateful. At the time they perhaps had not registered the importance of the issue being included in the Bill. That is a byway to bring the Minister up to date.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>I thank noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. I pick up particularly on the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Peel. I want him to speak to it first, but it is an important amendment and I am grateful to the Minister, who is going to consider it. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith raised an important point about climate change, which we debated last time. The announcement of the likelihood of water shortages emphasises that that is an urgent issue, which needs addressing.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I turn briefly to my noble friend Lord Rotherwick&#039;s contribution. I was going to raise the question of the report with my next amendment, so I shall not comment on it now. Many of the amendments seek clarification. I wonder whether the Minister in hindsight wishes that the Government had not put in a general purpose clause, as that would have solved many problems. We all know where we want to get to, but having such definitions in the Bill gives the Government problems. When we look at the responsibilities of the JNCC and its purpose, we see that the two do not tie up together, as my amendment suggests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   If the noble Lady would be kind enough to permit me to speak now, that would assist me in answering not her, on this occasion, but the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about marine life, so that it is on the record. I want to tell the Committee that, as part of the marine Bill, which is being considered in draft at the present time, we are considering widening the scope of marine nature conservation laws and introducing new management schemes to meet our marine conservation aims. Ultimately, we want legislation that ensures that we have the ability to protect marine species and habitats where and when there is a need to do so. That does not answer the noble Baroness&#039;s question about this Bill&#039;s relevance, but it may be of some use. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, for giving way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_252"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am always delighted to give way to receive such news. I thank the Minister. I suspect&#151;unless I am missing a trick&#151;that that measure is being debated as a draft Bill, because I have not seen a copy, but perhaps there is one out. I believe that it is hoped that later in the year a draft Bill will come forward. We await that with great anticipation, because it will be enormously helpful. With those few remarks&#151;in the next amendment, I would like to talk more about the planning policy statement&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_254"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment speaks for itself, so I shall not go over the ground that I have already covered. I have before me a copy of the ODPM <i>Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development</i>, which was released today. Certain sections refer to issues that are relevant to this Committee.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>On integrating sustainable development in development plans, the document states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_122"></a>&quot;Planning authorities should ensure that sustainable development is treated in an integrated way in their development plans. In particular, they should consider carefully the interrelationship between social inclusion, protecting and enhancing the environment, the prudent use of natural resources and economic development&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>The policy statement later refers to the need for planning authorities to take into account the range of effects, both negative and positive, on the environment of economic development, as well as the economic and social benefits of environmental protection.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>The statement raises other issues. Paragraph 28 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_123"></a>&quot;Planning authorities should demonstrate how their plans are integrating various elements of sustainable development and should seek to achieve outcomes which enable social, environmental and economic objectives to be achieved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>Paragraph 30, on spatial plans, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_124"></a>&quot;The new system of regional spatial strategies and local development documents should take a spatial planning approach. Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they can function&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>The Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, may not have the document in her hands, but it has great relevance to my amendment and others in the group. I therefore draw it to her attention. If she cannot respond today, I would be happy if she did so on Report. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_255"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 115, which is in the same group. It is a probing amendment which explores whether the Government believe that it is a good idea to expect the landscape to be enhanced. &quot;Enhancement&quot; may be a subjective term: one person&#039;s enhancement may be another&#039;s prettification or gentrification, which are rather undesirable in landscape terms.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>I thank the Minister for his reply about the marine environment. I hope that debate on this clause will underline why, if Natural England is envisaged to have a big part to play in the draft marine Bill, the general purpose clause should be drafted in such a way as to apply to marine areas as well.
</p>

<a name="60130-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>I shall make a couple of remarks on the planning system, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred. She made some important points. Since local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_116"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

development frameworks and regional spatial strategies are forward-looking, local authorities find it easier to accommodate sustainable development and to do a better job. Where there is perhaps still a big gap is in the reactive bit. Technically, the system is known as development control; in shorthand, it is often known as the planning system, because people are applying for planning permission. There is still quite a long way to go in accommodating real sustainable development in material planning considerations.

<p><a name="st_256"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I am sorry to be late in rising to support my noble friend Lady Byford. We come back to the theme of trying to make quite sure that we understand what the Government mean in this Bill, and therefore trying to wheedle out of them exactly what it is they mean, then we can proceed along the lines of agreeing or not. Where the amendment leaves out &quot;conserving&quot; and inserts &quot;protecting&quot;, I go back again to conserving an environment in the way of conserving an aspect, or in the way of conserving jam with sugar&#151;you keep it exactly as it is, there are no alterations at all. Whereas my understanding of &quot;protecting&quot; is allowing that environment&#151;as I have said, a vibrant, living and changing environment&#151;to have a natural change, and allowing it to account for climate change. I am not sure the example I shall give is particularly good. Let us go back to the bluebell woods. If you have some wonderful bluebell woods which are beginning to get eaten by an ever-growing population of muntjac, do you conserve those woods by culling the muntjac, or do you protect them by allowing the muntjac to breed and diminish that landscape? The difference is that either one allows the landscape to evolve or one does not. How is the Bill meant to be describing this?
</p>




<p><a name="st_257"></a>
<a name="60130-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   It is very seldom that I find myself not endorsing the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. On this occasion, I am not sure that she is right in her anxieties. It seems to me that there has been a great deal of thought in the drafting of this Bill, and from my own experience, it is sometimes quite clear in a very beautiful part of the landscape that there is something that could be done that would make it even more attractive. The danger is that inadvertently, by removing the &quot;enhancing&quot;, you might play into the hands of people who were not prepared to take that step, who were just traditionalists and who were not looking at what could be contributed to future generations by just doing what is obvious. From that standpoint, because so many of your Lordships have emphasised the importance of looking forward, I am sure in a balanced and responsible way, I think the Government are right to have this word &quot;enhancing&quot; in their draft.

<a name="60130-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Perhaps I may deal first with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the issue supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. Natural environment and <br>&nbsp;<br>

biodiversity do include marine. Natural England will be a key player in the new Marine Bill discussions, and it is too early yet to know how those discussions will conclude.
</p>

<a name="60130-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with &quot;enhance&quot;. For the past 40 years, the Countryside Agency has had programmes aimed at enhancing the landscape to improve people&#039;s quality of life. There have been popular programmes valued by both local communities and visitors, including, for example, the 12 community forests and the National Forest&#151;an area which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and I know well. Nor is &quot;enhancing&quot; restricted to improving the quality of all the worst landscapes. The Countryside Agency took the lead in developing the Thames Landscape Strategy for London, aimed at restoring and enhancing one of the most spectacular metropolitan landscapes in Europe. We do want to see Natural England continue to innovate in this area. We accept that the amendment would not rule that out as the word &quot;enhance&quot; remains in Clause 2(1), but we want to ensure that the staff and customers of Natural England understand that this work will continue&#151;in a way to be decided by the board.

</p>

<a name="60130-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>With regard to the issue of protecting, Natural England will be able to protect landscapes. The word &quot;conserved&quot; in the general purpose includes protection. Since the founding legislation of the Countryside Commission in 1968, the word &quot;conserve&quot; has been applied to landscape. References in existing landscape legislation to &quot;conserve and enhance&quot; have not curtailed the ability of the Countryside Agency to take action to protect landscapes, should that be required. Indeed, we would find the argument in favour of including the word &quot;protecting&quot; more convincing if the Countryside Agency had drawn any attention to an occasion in the past 40 years when the ability of the Countryside Commission, or Countryside Agency, to take action to protect a landscape had been inhibited by its founding legislation, but we can find no evidence of that at all.
</p>

<a name="60130-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>We have a unique geodiversity and flora and fauna that rely on a rich variety of habitats. I can assure noble Lords that the phrase &quot;conserved, enhanced and managed&quot; in the general purpose includes protection of landscapes. We expect Natural England to be a trenchant champion of every aspect of our natural environment, taking action to protect landscapes where that is the priority.
</p>

<a name="60130-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, raised the very interesting point about occasions when there is a conflict. But considering how to help&#151;in that case, artificially&#151;to protect the delicate balance, should it get completely out of hand, is part of the role of enhancing and protecting. That is an area that the noble Earl, Lord Peel, will understand particularly well.
</p>

<a name="60130-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>Some people have argued that &quot;protection&quot; applies to biodiversity, thus elevating its status above landscapes. I need to put on the record here that that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_118"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is not our intention. Including the word &quot;protecting&quot; in Clause 2(2)(a) in relation to biodiversity prevents any spurious claims that Natural England should support activities that may enhance biodiversity adversely, such as through the introduction of non-native species and genetically modified organisms. I am sure that noble Lords have no intention of weakening that particular protection.
</p>

<a name="60130-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>Following pre-legislative scrutiny at the suggestion of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, Clause 15 was amended at subsection (3) to include the requirement to consult Natural England and at subsection (6) to include the clarification that Natural England must have regard to guidance. Clause 15(1) on regional planning was also prompted by an EFRA Committee suggestion that Natural England should be under a duty to contribute to regional spatial strategies. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised the issue of the planning system at a very local level.

I could be completely wrong. I am fully prepared to accept that I am wrong and, unless the knowledge that I am wrong strikes me very quickly, I will have to hope that I am right and correct my mistake if I am wrong. But I am certain that it is to do not only with the management of space but with the relationship between different things within that area.

<a name="60130-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   In the debate on the Greater London Authority Bill, back in the late 1990s, we debated a regional spatial strategy. I was foolish enough to say that the concept had come to us from Brussels and that some of my colleagues on the Committee would therefore treat it with suspicion. The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Nicholas Winterton, called me sharply to order and said that I was not to bring such a consideration into the debate. I was wholly delighted when Mr Nicholas Rainsford, replying for the Government, said&#151;without actually alluding to myself&#151;that regional spatial strategy was a concept that was being introduced into our affairs from Brussels, whereupon Mr Winterton apologised to me. My noble friend Earl Peel and I had better have a conversation outside the Chamber.

It is not a point that had occurred to me before.

<a name="60130-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   For the record, I greatly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd. Going back to his previous comments, I bow to his much greater experience in these things. I am slightly surprised at the amendment, because we spent so much time during the passage of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 pleading for more provisions to enable people to understand the countryside better. Perhaps it is a probing amendment, but I certainly could not agree with the spirit of it, for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, so eloquently spelt out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_269"></a>
<a name="60130-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I must admit that I was rather puzzled by the noble Duke&#039;s support for this amendment, which would remove the provision and improvement of facilities for the study, understanding and enjoyment of the natural environment from the inclusive list of objectives included in Natural England&#039;s purpose. Helping people to study, understand and enjoy the natural environment has been an important part of the work of both the Countryside Agency and English Nature since the 1940s. &quot;Facilities&quot; is interpreted widely and includes everything from direct provision in the case of English Nature&#039;s national nature reserves, through grants towards visitor facilities, to websites and media projects aimed at children. My noble friend Lord Judd and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, share our view of an increasing need for action in this area. It makes a crucial long-term contribution towards sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60130-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>The general purpose in Clause 2(1) remains broad, so Natural England could continue activities in pursuit of these objectives even if the subsection was removed. But we prefer to keep it, since it both signals continuity with previous legislation and tells staff and customers that action to achieve these objectives will certainly form part of the body&#039;s work.
</p>

<a name="60130-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I hope that on that basis the noble Duke will feel able to withdraw this amendment and will consider very carefully the value of this work, especially in teaching those from a more urban background how the countryside works and in helping them to understand and to become part of the protection and enhancement of the countryside.

<a name="60130-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Amendment No. 1 concerns the first clause, on companies. This amendment has been raised with us by the Law Society. It seeks to draw attention to the fact that the Bill contains provisions that apply to business names used in the United Kingdom by overseas companies as well as those companies incorporated in the United Kingdom. The argument is that the references in Clause 1 should be as comprehensive as possible in defining the companies to which the provisions apply. Inserting this reference in Part 32 makes it much clearer where the relevant law is to be found, and therefore it improves the ease with which this legislation can be used. I beg to move.

We all share a common objective of updating and modernising company law and wherever possible deregulating. This Bill has been drafted on the basis of a great deal of expert advice and the widest possible consultation. Large sections of the Bill are highly technical. I had the hope that we could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all work together to produce a Bill that provides the best possible conditions for the success of British industry. It would appear from a press release from the Conservative party at the time of Second Reading and from the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning that the Conservative party wants to turn it into a cheap political battle. That is not the way to produce the best possible Bill for British industry. I do not think that British industry will forgive us if we waste time on making political speeches that could be better used to debate the highly complex issues in the Bill. We are very willing to listen to any suggestions as to how the Bill can be improved technically. I do not believe in politics-free politics, but I do believe that politicians should keep their attention firmly fixed on what is best for the economy and for the country. I hope therefore from now on that we can consider this Bill without trying to score cheap political points and with a clear focus on the good of the economy. That is what we on this side will certainly be trying to do.
</p>

<a name="60130-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>On Amendment No. 1, I appreciate that the noble Lord is trying to be helpful in providing a further cross-reference. The first 31 parts of the Bill apply to companies; Parts 32 onwards go wider, and Part 32 on business names, as Clause 789 explains, covers not just companies but individuals or partnerships carrying on business in the United Kingdom. Part 32 will not apply to overseas companies as such but will apply only if they are carrying on business here. The amendment is unnecessary and could even be seen as misleading.

<a name="60130-34_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response to the amendment. I am not quite so sure about his irritation in the first part of his remarks. I stand by what we said at Second Reading. As regards the purpose of the Bill according to the Government, and by which we intend to judge it, is it deregulatory; is it comprehensible; does it think small first; and, in our view, does it provide the right balance of risk and reward? Those points have been made clearly on all occasions, and we make them again. We have no wish to engage in what he describes as cheap political points or political battle about this. Equally, serious issues are raised in this Bill, which deserve a high level of public scrutiny.

<p><a name="st_6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 2 concerns Part 2, &quot;Company Formation&quot;, and Clause 8, &quot;Memorandum of association&quot;. We wish to probe the Government&#039;s thinking on this fundamental corporate document. Paragraphs 18 to 21 of the memorandum, sent by the DTI to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, state that, in future, regulations prescribing the form of the memorandum of association will not be subject to any form of parliamentary scrutiny. I can see why that would not be necessary for smaller companies where the document is unlikely to be very contentious or affect a great number of people. However, despite the intention to reduce the importance of this document, there must be an argument for parliamentary scrutiny of the format to be prescribed for larger companies. Its impact could be very great. In a company with many shareholders, it could consequently affect many people.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The memorandum lays out the fundamental issues concerning a company and, therefore, its shareholders. Our amendment will allow private companies and small companies to follow the standard non-scrutinised format, while for the larger, in particular, public companies, the regulations proscribing the format will be subject to the negative resolution procedure as currently required by Section 3 and/or Section 744 of the Companies Act 1985.

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60130-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   It may be worth setting out what the memorandum of a company will be under the Bill. The Company Law Review looked very carefully at the question of the company&#039;s constitution. It was keen to see the company&#039;s internal rules as far as possible set out logically in one place and pointed out the potential for overlap under current arrangements between a company&#039;s memorandum and its articles.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>In taking forward those valuable suggestions, we wanted to do away with any scope for confusion between the memorandum and the articles, and introduce a clear distinction between the information <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the memorandum, which will be in effect an historical snapshot, which, once provided, has no continuing relevance, and the constitution of the company properly-so-called, as contained essentially in its articles, which will be of real significance in the company&#039;s life. In making this clear-cut distinction, I believe that the Bill introduces a valuable element of clarity to what can be a confusing picture under existing legislation.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The result is that the memorandum will in future be a very much shorter document than a memorandum under the current Act, and will be restricted to the simple information set out in Clause 8&#151;that is: the fact that certain persons wish to form a company; that they agree to become members; that, as appropriate, they agree to take a share; and their signatures. That is all. It is an historical snapshot of the company on its formation with no continuing relevance beyond that. Although, as the clause states, the form of the memorandum will be set out in regulations, the Committee need not fear that those regulations will create extra obligations or different provisions for different types of company.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Much of the information which, under the current Act, is contained in a company&#039;s memorandum, will instead, under the Bill, either be in statements made to the registrar on formation or in a company&#039;s articles. Given that, it would be confusing and unnecessary to maintain two separate types of company memorandum under the Bill&#151;one new style and one old&#151;depending on the nature of the company. But the amendment would create precisely such a division between private and small companies on the one hand and the larger public companies on the other.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Leaving aside the fact that, depending on the definition adopted, few companies would be likely to be anything other than small at the moment of their formation&#151;certainly they will have no turnover at that point&#151;I simply do not feel that it is useful to introduce such a distinction.

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Government have stated that the Bill&#039;s objective is to provide a single company law regime for the whole of the United Kingdom. Paragraph 8 of the Explanatory Notes states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;The Bill extends company law to the whole of the UK, so that companies will be UK companies rather than GB companies or Northern Ireland companies as at present&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>If the Bill is intended to provide a unified company law for the whole of the United Kingdom, I am unclear why we still need a requirement for a company to state in which region of the United Kingdom its registered office is. That is required under Clause 9(2)(b). That adds nothing to the registration process. Surely a more meaningful requirement would be for the company to state the address at which its registered office is to be found. That would provide greater clarity and accountability.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>However, the clause raises another issue. As it stands, does it allow regional registrars to use different registration procedures? Are we at risk of assiduous risk-averse registrars requiring an over-abundance of documents for registration? That could easily lead to an unlevel registration playing field and, hence, to companies choosing to register in one region over another because of the relative simplicity of the registration procedure. That is surely an undesirable consequence in a country where the law relating to companies is meant to be uniform.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The same arguments arise in support of Amendment No. 12, which addresses Clause 16. Amendment No. 16 seeks to replace paragraph (e) of Clause 16(2) with the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;that the company is registered in the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>

<a name="60130-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I cannot help but think that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has been advised that it is desirable to table any amendment to the Bill. As a lawyer I consider that there is a distinction in the words in paragraph (e),


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;in England and Wales (or in Wales), in Scotland or in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Nothing he has said in any way disproves that point. Why bother? There is a lot in the Bill that we should be considering rather than wasting the Committee&#039;s time.

</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60130-35_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   First, on a point of detail, let me make clear that the requirement for a company to state the address of its registered office already appears in Clause 9(5)(a), and there is therefore no need for it to be repeated elsewhere in the clause.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Putting that on one side, the effect of these amendments would be to remove the obligation on companies to state where in the United Kingdom they are registering, and for the registrar to provide them <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with a certificate of incorporation which specifies that location. Instead, companies would register in the UK as a whole.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>On the face of it there is some attraction to this proposition. Company law is already essentially the same across England and Wales and Scotland, and the jurisdiction of registration therefore has little or no effect on the way that company law operates on these companies. And, while Northern Ireland company law is currently set out in separate legislation, the Bill brings Northern Ireland companies within the same legislation as companies in Great Britain, meaning that we are now legislating for the first time on a UK-wide basis. We will of course come to this at Part 35 of the Bill. However, there are good reasons why it remains important to know whether a company is registered in England and Wales, in Wales, in Scotland or in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>While company law may be the same across the country, the same is not true for all aspects of the law. The law on company charges&#151;for example, mortgages and the like&#151;is different in Scotland, and whether a company incorporates in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK can have significant effects on its operations in this respect.
</p>

<a name="60130-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Similarly, while the Bill will essentially harmonise company law between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, many other aspects of law will remain covered by separate legislation in Northern Ireland&#151;for example, insolvency law&#151;and the jurisdiction of registration will continue to have an important legal effect. Where registration would be different in different parts of the country, requirements are set out in the Bill that would cover the whole of the United Kingdom.

<a name="60130-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I thank the Minister for that. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, who clearly finds this an irritating amendment, that it is tabled because the Government are talking about introducing a comprehensive law for the United Kingdom. Therefore, we want to explore whether the different countries in the United Kingdom should form part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I fear that I shall irritate the noble Lord a lot this afternoon because many of our amendments are matters of details.

operating in.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 5, line 4, leave out &quot;It&quot; and insert &quot;The first annual return&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>The noble Lord said: I speak to Amendment No. 4 and address Amendment No. 7, which concern Clause 10. This issue has been raised by a number of city law firms. It seems rather pointless to require a statement of initial shareholdings, including names and addresses of the subscribers to the memorandum of association when the initial shareholding may well be one share of &#163;1 issued by a company formation agent.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I was one of two shareholders in a public company, which was later grossed up and eventually sold for &#163;350 million. Sadly, I no longer owned 50 per cent of the company at that point. But my presence on the statement of initial shareholdings added absolutely nothing to the knowledge of the company and the way it operated.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We argue that it would make more sense to include these details in the first annual return. By this time the company will be owned by those who are running and developing it rather than the company formation agent. These amendments would rectify that anomaly and are deregulatory, which I hope will commend itself to the Minister. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60130-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I do not think there is any disagreement that it is important for third parties to be able to find out who forms a company; that is, who its first members are. This information is already required to be included in the memorandum by regulations under the current Act. As noble Lords know, a company&#039;s memorandum must be supplied to the registrar on formation and is available to the public once the company is formed. Under the Bill, the memorandum is in future to perform a more limited purpose and contain significantly less information. Under the new architecture, the information about the shares to be taken will be provided in the company&#039;s statement of initial shareholdings instead. It is true that the Bill retains a power to prescribe the form for the new style memorandum, but this is about the prescribing of the form rather than its content.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The question that seems to be at issue with these amendments is when the information about shareholdings should first be provided. The clause as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

drafted makes clear that information about the subscribers to the memorandum&#151;the people forming the company and who will take the initial shares&#151;must be provided at the point of formation, as now. In other words, as soon as a company is formed, the information about the subscribers and what shares they are to take is immediately available. Under the amendments, this information would not be provided until the first annual return is made to the registrar, a period which, under Section 363(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1985, could be a year after formation. In the mean time, it is true, the memorandum of the company would reveal who the subscribers were, but it will not provide information on how many shares each member takes or an address for each subscriber.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>By the time the annual return is made, these initial shareholdings may well have changed; for example where the company has in fact been formed by a formation agent, as very frequently happens. Therefore it would be illogical to require, as the amendment seeks, information to be provided in 12 months&#039; time about the position that obtained 12 months earlier, on formation. It would also be unhelpful for companies to exist for 12 months without full information about membership on formation being available. Having this information on formation is essential if, as can happen, the company is late in sending its first annual return or it does not survive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60130-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Can the Minister explain what useful information is available by recording the subscribers for companies formed by formation agents, which covers a large number of new companies? I struggle to understand why that information is regarded as useful to have on the record. Within a week or so, we know that those shareholders are usually replaced by whoever the substantive shareholders are to be. That information already will not be available until some time later. So if there is an issue about providing substantial information, it would not be solved either by Clause 10 or by the amendment moved by my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60130-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   We are talking about the company&#039;s statement of initial shareholdings, which is extremely important. Taking the circumstances I mentioned at the end of my remarks, covering a company which is trading in some way and which then becomes insolvent, it would be important to know what the initial shareholdings were.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60130-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend for her support and to the Minister for his comments.

<a name="column_GC9"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

at is the shareholdings at the point when the first annual return is made&#151;not the initial shareholdings. That is where our drafting is faulty, and my noble friend is absolutely right. We would like to look at this again&#151;not because we wish to conceal who is behind the company, but because it would be much more meaningful if you could reveal who the shareholders were at the first annual return in relation to how the company was moving forward. That would provide more information to customers, suppliers and so on. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60130-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Minister may recall a debate during the Committee stage of the Enterprise Act 2002. He argued for relaxing the bankruptcy provisions to enable individuals to move on to a new enterprise, often having gained valuable experience as a result of previous failures. The Minister drew the attention of the House to the United States, where every serious entrepreneur has at least one failure to his name.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I accepted the force of that argument and I still accept it, but there is still a downside, which we discussed then. Every bankruptcy costs the creditors of the company money. Those creditors are often small companies. On the other hand, I understand that there is a need for anonymity and we have seen a number of cases where directors, or subscribers to the company who may have remained directors, have been terrorised by outside bodies. So there is a balance to be struck between making it harder for serial bankrupts, such as those who seek to use a corporate disguise by starting a new company with a &quot;PO Box X&quot; address, and the need to protect directors, such as those legitimately involved in the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals, who may be at risk of being targeted by extremist groups.
</p>

<a name="60130-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>There is also the wider issue of what happens to historic records at Companies House. Will they be anonymised? For example, if the directors of company A are targeted and retreat behind a corporate veil, what happens to the company&#039;s returns from previous years. At present, one has merely to leaf through a company&#039;s file to find a director&#039;s private address from the memorandum. Only when the director moves house does he become anonymous.

If all the parties incorporating the company were determined to ensure that the bankrupt&#039;s details are not disclosed, they could simply agree that that information would not be incorporated. Otherwise, I do not understand who are the parties to &quot;unless otherwise agreed&quot;. Presumably, they are the original incorporators.

This amendment seeks to extend that liability from one year to three years.
</p>

<a name="60130-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The increase in the length of time a person may be liable to contribute will surely increase accountability in such companies and promote long-term thinking by members who have given a guarantee. For example, a member giving a guarantee to a company with a December year-end who resigned immediately after the publication of the year&#039;s accounts in, say, February, could be released from his guarantee before any further annual accounts were published. We wonder whether that is sensible or, indeed, fair. The amendment also addresses the concern that companies may take longer than one year to wind up fully.

</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60130-37_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   This amendment deals with the position of companies limited by guarantee. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Such companies are, of course, rather different from companies limited by shares in that in the absence of share capital, provision is made for the members to meet the debts of the company on its winding up to the limit set by the guarantee&#151;for example, &#163;1. Given the absence of share capital, companies of this type are most often, though not exclusively, found in the not-for-profit sector, for example companies serving some kind of community purpose.
</p>

<a name="60130-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Membership of a guarantee company is not transferable and membership cannot be &quot;sold on&quot; as it is with shares. The guarantee disappears with the guarantor, and it is therefore appropriate that members of the company should remain liable for some period after they cease to be members. The current Companies Act places this period at one year. I believe that this remains appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60130-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Of course, in many instances the amount of guarantee is small, if not purely nominal. None the less I would worry a little at the signal we would be sending were we to make a three-fold increase in the period of potential liability. For many guarantee companies&#151;for example, flat management companies, which often take this form&#151;continued involvement in any form long after the member has ceased his or her connection would act as a significant disincentive for people to assume the role of a guarantor. By extending the relevant period to three years, the amendment, if accepted, would impose an unnecessary burden on the guarantor. There seems to be no good reason to increase the present period, which has stood the test of time since the Companies Act 1862.

</p>

<a name="60130-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>This issue has been raised with us by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. As the Bill is currently drafted, only public companies are required to have secretaries and so only public companies must send to the registrar details of their proposed secretaries. Amendments Nos. 283 to 286 concern where the line is to be drawn between companies that are required to have secretaries and <br>&nbsp;<br>

those not so required. However, we shall have the substantive debate on those issues when we discuss Part 12. As we have explained to the Minister&#039;s officials, we felt that it would be confusing to have that debate at this point. The amendments we have drafted will not require us to go over the points twice. We achieve this by seeking to replace the words &quot;public company&quot; with &quot;company required to have a secretary&quot; which, as the Bill currently stands, has precisely the same meaning.
</p>

<a name="60130-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Even though the Government propose that no private company will be required to have a company secretary, surely there should be a provision for those private companies which still wish to have a secretary to retain one. If a company wishes to have a secretary, whether required to do so or not, that fact and that person, or those persons, fulfilling the secretarial role should be included in the statement of proposed officers which has to be sent to the registrar. This amendment seeks to give effect to the above argument by requiring that any company wishing to have a company secretary, whether through requirement or desire, is required to send the details required by Clause 13 to the registrar. Exactly the same issues apply in respect of Clause 17, which is addressed by our Amendment No. 16. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60130-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   These amendments relate to the important subject of company secretaries. Later provisions in Part 12 set out the law on this subject in detail. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, I believe it would be sensible to wait until we reach that part of the Bill before entering into a substantive debate.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>However, the amendments in question touch on an important point about the way in which the Bill handles the issue of company secretaries in private companies. As Members of the Committee know, the Bill proceeds on the basis that the office of company secretary is a requirement for public companies, but not for private companies. It may be that we will debate the policy merits of this position later on, but for the moment I would like to focus on the practical consequences. For a public company, there must always be a company secretary. No company can become a public company without one; and third parties have an interest in knowing who that person is. It is therefore essential that public companies, right from the start, have a secretary and provide the identity of such a person for disclosure on the public register. The Bill provides the mechanism for this.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The question is what should happen where a private company has a secretary. There is no function explicitly reserved to the company secretary in the current legislation. Companies vary widely regarding the responsibilities of their secretaries, with some contracting out what is a main responsibility in others. Under the Bill, whether a private company appoints a person to act in the office of secretary is an entirely voluntary matter and, while many may choose to do so, in formal terms the secretary of a private company will be rather like other officers it may choose to appoint&#151;say, the chairman of the company&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occupying what is clearly an office within the company, but one which is not required by law or which the law specifically regulates. Since the appointment of the secretary is a voluntary matter for the company, a private company can change its mind at any time about whether it has or does not have a secretary.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Last spring, we consulted over an approach under which a private company could opt to retain the office of company secretary, with any appointment being notified to Companies House. The response to the consultation was clear: this approach is too complex. As a result of that consultation, we believe that third parties should not be required under any circumstances to know whether a particular private company has a secretary. Therefore, any requirement that a private company secretary be disclosed on the public register would be unnecessary regulation, which we all want to avoid.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60130-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am disappointed with the Minister. While I understand that company secretaries in private companies will not have a regulatory role, the value of a company secretary in achieving better corporate governance by keeping the directors aware of good practice and, indeed, legal practice, can only be positive. While clearly for very small companies it is not a good regulation, for larger private companies&#151;and there are some very large private companies&#151;it is a pity if there is to be no role and no reason for building up the position and the functions of a company secretary in that regard. In part, we are starting to get into the debate on the later part of the Bill, so I will stop there. But I am disappointed that the Government have not seen fit to include this enabling arrangement, which does no harm. The Bill states that public company and company secretary will be in the position because of the definitions which we will have in our later debates. I am disappointed that the Government cannot be a little more positive about that.

No doubt we shall debate that matter shortly. I will stop sparring until we reach the substantive discussion in Part 12. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_41"></a>The noble Lord said: We return to the location of company offices. This issue was raised by some city law firms.

<a name="60130-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I know that this is a favourite subject of the House of Lords and I have experienced many examples of it. Perhaps I may explain what I believe is a sensible rationale of this point. We have discussed the various jurisdictions within the UK. It is true that there are no great differences between England and Wales in the way that there are between England and Scotland. England and Wales are treated as one jurisdiction for these purposes, which needs to be mentioned in the clause as a single jurisdiction in its own right. But there remains an important reason for retaining the ability for a company&#039;s registered office to be stated in the register to be in Wales, since this attracts specific provisions as to language requirements. We may come to these later in the Bill, but for now I say simply that it is right that a company should be able to choose to have its registered office stated in the register as being in Wales so that it can take advantage of the special language provisions if it so wishes.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 14, I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 102, 104 and 108. A certificate of incorporation is issued by the registrar when a company is initially registered or when it is re-registered, and in certain other circumstances. The certificate of incorporation provides valuable confirmation to persons dealing with a company that it has indeed been duly established. The certificate will state that the company has been duly registered along with certain other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

information as to the status of the company; for example, that it has been registered as a public company or a limited company as the case may be.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The question is: what provision needs to be explicitly made for the certificate to stand as conclusive evidence of the matters set out in it? It seems appropriate to make clear that the certificate should stand as conclusive evidence of what it provides for; namely, that the company has been duly registered or re-registered under the Act. But I am not sure that it is necessary or desirable for it to go further than that.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The current position under the 1985 Act is arguably inconsistent. The certificate of incorporation will contain information on the status of a company, but the Act only provides explicitly that the certificate provides conclusive evidence of the public status of a company and not, for example, whether it is limited. The Bill takes a slightly different approach and provides that the certificate is conclusive evidence of whether the company is limited or public, but not, for example, of whether it is private.
</p>

<a name="60130-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Neither approach is as helpful as it could be. As will be seen from the government amendments, the Government propose a simple approach to resolving the inconsistencies&#151;by omitting such provisions altogether. They are not needed once it is established that the certificate provides conclusive evidence that the company has been duly registered. If it has complied with the requirements of registration, it necessarily follows, and third parties can rely on the fact: that it has been duly registered as a public company, a limited company, or whatever. So further provision is unnecessary and could be confusing. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment concerns the entrenched provisions of articles. The Bill introduces a recommendation of the Company Law Review that members of a company should be able to choose to entrench elements of a company&#039;s constitution in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC17"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

articles. However, as currently worded, the provision appears to be a lame duck. The Bill requires unanimous agreement by all members of the company, something which in practice may be extremely difficult to achieve. Under the wording an individual member could block the entrenchment, not even necessarily with any malicious intent. A member of the company may die and until probate has been granted, no one can give assent on behalf of his shares.
</p>

<a name="60130-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The Companies Act 1985 provides that in the case of a takeover there may be a compulsory buyout of any remaining unaccepting shares if the purchasing company receives acceptances from more than 90 per cent of the shares. If a 90 per cent level of acceptances empowers compulsory buyout, a similar percentage should allow for the entrenchment of articles&#151;arguably a less drastic measure. The amendment therefore lowers the threshold at which companies can entrench articles to 90 per cent of members agreeing. That sidesteps the problem of an obstructive and insignificant minority blocking such a motion while still providing security from abuse, in that a majority of 90 per cent must agree with whatever is proposed. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60130-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The ability of companies to entrench certain provisions in their articles is valuable, especially in the light of changes in the Bill to a company&#039;s memorandum. The information which, under the Companies Act 1985, is contained in the company&#039;s memorandum will, under the Bill, either be in statements made to the registrar on formation, such as the situation of the company&#039;s registered office, or in a company&#039;s articles, such as the restriction of a company&#039;s objects.
</p>

<a name="60130-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Given that some key constitutional information will now be in a company&#039;s articles rather than its memorandum, and given that the constitutional material in those articles in effect forms the internal rules of the company, some companies will want to be able to make clear that certain rules are so core to the nature of the company that they cannot be changed at all, or only under restricted conditions. An example would be a special provision restricting the objects of a company. Entrenchment allows this to be done.
</p>

<a name="60130-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Such entrenchment provisions are particularly important in ensuring that potential investors know the nature of the company that they are joining; in other words, that it is a company holding certain provisions and not others as more or less inviolable. Of course, if all the members later decide unanimously that they wish to add further core rules to the set of entrenched provisions and no member can suffer, they should be allowed to do so. The Bill permits this, but it would be a step too far to allow a 90 per cent majority to act in that way. The addition of further entrenched provisions could have the effect of significantly and definitively altering the nature of the company. Allowing the voices of up to 10 per cent of the members to be ignored in those circumstances might be seen as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

calling into question the basis on which minority members would have signed up to the company and, at least potentially, be open to abuse.

<a name="60130-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I hope that he will forgive me for saying that his speaking note is not compelling. If I can acquire a person&#039;s shares compulsorily and forever by obtaining 90 per cent and the blocking 10 or 9.9 per cent can have their shares removed from them come what may, that is much more potentially damaging to the minority than would be the case with entrenchment. We encourage the Government to consider a slightly lower percentage because we want some flexibility. If 90 per cent of the members of a company agree that entrenchment would be a good idea, then surely the 10 per cent should not be able to block it. In the example I gave, it might be possible not to entrench because a member has died and probate has not been granted on the estate; assent could not be given. The proposed corporate arrangement would be held up.

<a name="60130-39_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Thank you, Deputy Chairman. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are concerned with Clauses 24 and 25. This issue has been raised with us <i>inter alia</i> by Miss Brenda Hannigan of the Southampton University School of Law. The concern is that as the alteration of entrenched articles is a purely contractual and internal matter between the members of the company, the requirement that a company sends a statement of compliance seems superfluous. Surely a straightforward notice as per subsection (1) of the two clauses should suffice. One could argue that this is an unnecessary increase in the burden on companies rather than the deregulation that is a major objective of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister could explain the appropriateness of attaching a criminal offence to this, as per Clause 28(1) and Clause 28(4). If a company has altered its articles incorrectly, the members have adequate redress through the standard civil channels without burdening the registrar and criminal justice system with yet more work. The amendment seeks to remove the need to produce the statement of compliance but not the need <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC19"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to give notice to the registrar where a company has included or has altered entrenched articles. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60130-39_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   In considering these amendments it is worth pointing out that the statement of compliance which companies are required to provide when notifying the registrar where entrenched provisions are included in their articles, or where entrenched provisions are removed, is not an onerous procedure. There is no complex requirement in the Bill for an independent legal countersignature or anything similar, but the need to make the statement will force the directors to pause and take stock, and ensure they have satisfied themselves that any necessary restrictions have been observed when a change to the company&#039;s constitution is made.
</p>

<a name="60130-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The existence of the statement of compliance also helps to ensure that information delivered to the registrar and hence on the public record is accurate, without the need for the registrar to make inquiries of the company on whether conditions have been satisfied. I believe, therefore, that the requirement to make a statement of compliance in these circumstances is a useful and necessary protection.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60130-39_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I must say that that is a disappointing response. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, remarked that I am not being sufficiently deregulatory and here I offer the Government the chance to strike out six subsections, Clause 24(2) to (4) and Clause 25(2) to (4). The Minister says that it is a simple procedure and in place only to &quot;take stock&quot;, to repeat the phrase I think he used. I regret that he cannot see that it would be worthwhile to get rid of this. I admit that the provision is not used frequently, but surely we could have dispensed with this additional statement. Directors who are sensible and worthwhile will give notice only when they have done their duty. Those who are not sensible and worthwhile will not be deterred in any way by the provisions set out in these subsections. We will pull back today, but we may well wish to look at the point again later. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The Bill helps to ensure that this is the case by triggering an obligation on the company to file information when certain events take place, for example where a company passes a resolution or enters into an agreement affecting its constitution or, in the rather less common case under Clause 36, where a company&#039;s constitution will be amended by certain types of enactment.
</p>

<a name="60130-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The difficulty arises because the clauses as currently drafted link the obligation to file a copy of the articles as amended with the obligation to file a copy of the document making or evidencing the amendment or notice of the enactment which makes the change. While this proposition works in the majority of cases, it does not work where, for example, the document making or evidencing the alteration is a conditional resolution and the conditions specified in the resolution have not been met. In those circumstances, the alteration to the articles has not yet taken effect and it is clearly inappropriate and potentially misleading to file a copy of the articles for public disclosure at this stage showing what they would look like once the amendment takes effect in the future.
</p>

<a name="60130-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The amendments to these clauses therefore divorce the requirement to file an up to date copy of the articles from the obligation to file the document which gives rise to the change. Both requirements remain in the Bill, but by ensuring they are separate, we ensure that the obligation to file for example the amended articles bites only once the amendment has taken effect, thus ensuring that the version of the articles which appears on the public register will be the version of the articles that is in force. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 21, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 22. It is concerned with Clause 28 regarding the registrar&#039;s notice to comply in case of failure with respect to amended articles. The clause deals with the power of the registrar to penalise companies who fail to act on a notice given to send amended articles to the registrar. The question we wish to raise with the Government is whether &#163;200 is an appropriate level of penalty. To many companies, even quite small companies, that is pretty near a petty cash item and may not provide an adequate deterrent.
</p>

<a name="60130-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The Committee might like to bear in mind that this penalty is for a failure to comply with the notice already given by the registrar and will not arise merely from oversight. Our amendment, on a probing basis, seeks to raise the level of penalty to &#163;1,000 plus &#163;100 daily thereafter to provide a proper incentive for companies to send the documents required within the allotted time as given by the registrar&#039;s notice. It also means that the penalty would match the level 3 fine proposed in Clause 27(4) that states that the registrar is to be sent a copy of amended articles, which is surely a similar scale of offence. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60130-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Other clauses in the Bill establish the duty for companies to send to the registrar copies of any document that makes an alteration to their articles and a copy of the amended articles themselves. I very much share the view that these are important provisions, and it is right that there should be appropriate penalties if they are contravened. That is why under Clause 27(3) failure to comply with the requirements is an offence. Clause 28 introduces an additional procedure for the registrar to use to encourage a company in default of the requirements to comply with them, without resorting to a criminal prosecution in the first instance. You can issue a notice requiring compliance with the requirements, and failure to comply results in a civil penalty of &#163;200.
</p>

<a name="60130-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I cannot agree with the noble Lord that the one-off penalty should be raised to the amount suggested in the amendment. We consider that &#163;200 is the right amount for the one-off civil penalty. It is not our intention to overpenalise companies through that route but rather to encourage compliance with the law. In particular, the suggestion that there should be a daily default fine of &#163;100 for each day of continued contravention would risk penalising companies very heavily. It would weigh particularly heavily on smaller firms with a lesser turnover and could rapidly come to have a significant consequence for their business. Such a penalty is unnecessary because the registrar could, if necessary, seek to prosecute the company for failure to comply with the duty. For those reasons, I believe that the Bill as it stands takes the right approach to penalties in this area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60130-40_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. Am I right in thinking that if you do not send the registrar a copy of your amended articles, you get fined not above &#163;1,000 and you have a daily default fine not exceeding &#163;100; and if you do not comply and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

he tells you that you have not complied and says, &quot;Please get on with it&quot; and issues you a notice, the maximum he can fine you is &#163;200? If I have got that wrong then I withdraw it, but it seems to me this is a second tier. By the time you get to Clause 28, you have already failed to comply with Clause 27. Therefore, it seems strange that you should be fined &#163;1,000 for failure under Clause 27, but when you fail under Clause 27 and have been told about it under Clause 28 you can then be fined only &#163;200.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60130-40_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Perhaps I may point out that this is in addition to any liability to criminal proceedings in respect of the failure that was mentioned. As I said, this is pitched at the right level to encourage compliance.

<a name="60130-40_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I find that strange.

If that is the Government&#039;s view we will withdraw the amendment and reflect further on it, but I am surprised at the relative level that the Government wish to stick to.

However, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC23"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 29 is silent on how any consequent conflict between the provisions of the memorandum and articles is to be dealt with. The amendment provides a remedy to deal with that circumstance and follows the existing procedure, which gives priority to the memorandum over the articles.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The Minister may want to be aware that there is confusion out there about the drafting, especially the repeated use of the word &quot;provision&quot;. Clause 29(3) states:

<a name="60130-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   As I am speaking for the first time in this Grand Committee, perhaps I may say two general things. First, I hope that we will approach our deliberations in Grand Committee in the spirit that we have a complicated Bill that we will endeavour to improve, rather than indulge in partisan negotiations through the pages of newspapers. Wearing my election hat, it would have been easy to take the same approach as has the Conservative Party on this, but my noble friend Lord Sharman and I take the view that we shall try to persuade the Minister of the effectiveness of our amendments and that we are likely to be less successful if the Committee is turned into a partisan yah-boo session.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Secondly, I repeat the comments that I made at Second Reading. It is perhaps appropriate that the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, has entered the room at this moment. Without wanting to indulge in a debate about the composition of your Lordships&#039; House, it is a great pity that many captains of industry have accepted peerages on the basis of the expertise that they will be able to bring to the deliberations of your Lordships&#039; House, yet none of them, with notable exceptions, seem to find the time to participate in an exercise on which their expertise should be brought to bear. I exempt from those remarks my noble friends Lord Sharman and Lord Vallance, both of whom will participate in our deliberations in Grand Committee, although neither of them is in his place. I obviously also exempt the Minister, who is here wearing a different hat from that which he used to wear. I know that a number of colleagues on all four sides of the House agree with my point, which I shall keep repeating until something is done about it.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>At Second Reading, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat oppositions expressed disappointment at the absence of a codification of company law in the Bill. The amendment provides a classic example of why codification is essential. Unless the potential conflict between a company&#039;s memorandum of association and articles of association is dealt in this way where existing provisions in a company&#039;s memorandum are transferred to the articles, we will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC24"></a>

have a difficulty. If the Minister is not too put off by the partisan nature of the attack on him, I hope that he will accept the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60130-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for explaining his party&#039;s approach to these proceedings. As he and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, there is a long-established principle of current case law that if there is a conflict between a provision contained in a company&#039;s memorandum and a provision in its articles, it is the provision in the memorandum which prevails. I apologise for three &quot;provisions&quot; already in the note. That principle sits alongside a number of other common law rules about the relationship between company&#039;s memoranda and its articles, all of which comes from a time when a company&#039;s memorandum was regarded as its &quot;charter&quot; and its fundamental and generally unalterable law. The position of memoranda under the Bill will be very different; they will be mere historical records of the intention to form a company. In the case of existing companies, their substantive provisions will be deemed by virtue of Clause 29 to be part of their articles.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>As the status of the memorandum changes, we have to consider how the old principles established by case law should be applied under the new regime and we need to strike a balance between certainty, convenience and flexibility. We want the status of existing provisions, wherever they are set out, to be made as clear as possible. We do not want the new legislation to oblige companies to reorganise the provisions of their memoranda or articles when they would not otherwise be making changes to them. We do not want to restrict the ability of the courts to reach sensible conclusions in particular cases which we may not have foreseen at this stage.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We do not disagree with the thinking behind the amendment. It addresses a question which is very important, but which is only one of the questions that needs to be addressed in this context. Consider, for example, cases where a provision contained in the memorandum of an existing company immediately before Clause 29 comes into force is contradicted by a provision which is inserted into the articles by a subsequent special resolution. It is not clear to us that the result in every such case should be that the ex-provision of the memorandum should prevail.
</p>

<a name="60130-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I am grateful to the Law Society and to the noble Lord for providing an opportunity to discuss this important issue at this stage. However, this is a complex area and we need to give further thought in the round to all the possible scenarios and the impact which any legislative propositions would have on the existing common law rules. I hope noble Lords will therefore not be too disappointed when I say that I think that the appropriate place to deal with all the detailed practical issues arising from the change in status of the memorandum and the basic proposition set out in Clause 29 is in the context of transitional <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 25 seeks to leave out Clause 30(1)(b). While it is certainly desirable for companies to file with the registrar any agreement that alters the constitution of the company, there is in practice great difficulty not only in companies understanding which agreements alter the constitution but also in enforcing any clause requiring the registration of these agreements.
</p>

<a name="60130-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>One of these grey areas in which there is widespread lack of understanding and enforcement is in shareholder agreements as provided in Clause 30(1)(b). That is where shareholders may unanimously agree a resolution or agreement but either fail to notice that it is altering the company&#039;s constitution or fail to register it for other reasons. For example, some agreements are regarded as &quot;personal&quot;&#151;a situation where a founder of a company is appointed a director of a company for life and, that person, for all sorts of reasons, does not wish it be filed with the registrar.
</p>

<a name="60130-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>As these are agreed by all shareholders, there is no need for a special resolution to pass them and so they are often not picked up by the company as requiring registration. There seems little point in legislating that these agreements must be filed if, in practice, the requirement is neither followed nor enforced. The amendment would remove these types of agreement from the requirements under Clause 31&#151;copies to be forward and recorded by the registrar&#151;and Clause 32&#151;agreements to be embodied in or attached to articles&#151;and the corresponding criminal offences. The alternative would be to call for stricter enforcement of this requirement. However, as we are all so keen on deregulation, I am sure that this is a path that the Government would not wish to follow. I beg to move.

restates Section 380(4)(c) of the 1985 Act. Subsection (1)(b) is important, as members of companies can take decisions informally by unanimous consent that ordinarily they would need to take by special resolution.

<a name="60130-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The Bill removes the distinction between extraordinary resolutions, requiring a majority of 75 per cent of the members and 14 days&#039; notice, and special resolutions, because it reduces the length of notice needed for a special resolution, requiring a majority of 75 per cent and 21 days&#039; notice. Accordingly, in restated clauses reference to extraordinary resolutions have become references to special resolutions. Therefore, there is no need for a reference to extraordinary resolutions in Clause 30, as the Bill provides that special resolutions require 14 days&#039; notice. The distinct category of extraordinary resolutions is unnecessary and hence Clause 30 does not operate in relation to them.

<a name="60130-42_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Similarly, the suggestion to omit subsection (1)(f) relating to resolutions under Section 578 does not seem right. In this case, the Bill includes new provisions on redenomination of share capital in Part 19 which do not appear in the 1985 Act. While it is true that redenomination of share capital, for example, from sterling to euros or to dollars will not affect the amount of share capital, it will still be a material change to what one might call the company&#039;s basic constitution. Therefore, it is appropriate to include that in this section so it is filed on the public register. This is, indeed, a change.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The table of derivations describes Clause 31 as making no substantive change, yet under the Bill as drafted the registrar need not record the resolution or agreement within 15 days.

</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60130-43_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Clause 30 sets out a variety of types of resolutions and agreements which affect a company&#039;s constitution and which, under this clause, a company is required to send to the registrar. This requirement is important. A company&#039;s constitution is a public document, which is available for inspection by anyone who wishes, and gives valuable information to those who deal with the company. If resolutions or agreements are entered into which affect the constitution, it is important that they should be provided quickly to the registrar, so that not only are they available for pubic inspection, they also should be available quickly&#151;otherwise the register could be misleading.
</p>

<a name="60130-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The clause restates the obligation currently contained in Section 380 of the Companies Act. The wording has changed somewhat, but only in the interests of clarity. I can confirm that no change is intended or, I believe, is made to the substance of the obligation; namely, that companies must provide the relevant documents within 15 days. I will look at the question of &quot;approved&quot; versus &quot;prescribed&quot; to see whether there is any significance, and will come back if there is any difference.

He has to receive it but not record it. I think that the Minister said that it is the recording that is critical because it is needed in order to keep the details up to date. While I will withdraw the amendment today, I would be grateful if the Minister would look at that again to make sure that the Bill, as drafted, achieves what I think he thinks it achieves.

It is almost certain that both the shareholders and the amounts subscribed will have changed. Why should a company be obliged to provide this information when it can be of no real use to a current member? It seems to be something that we could easily dispense with after a period of time.

The obligations currently in the clause are not excessively onerous. They relate, as the clause title indicates, to the basic constitutional documents of the company. Since constitutional material of this sort forms, so to speak, the contract between the company and its members, it is important that all parties should have ready access to the information to understand their rights and obligations as clearly as possible. The amendment would remove the obligation on the company to provide a copy of the statement of its initial shareholdings, but this is one of the fundamental pieces of information about the company under Clause 10, indicating those people who are the company&#039;s original members. This information should be considered separately from other material of its kind.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 36, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 37, which is grouped with it. We are still discussing the question of documents to be provided to members. This has been particularly drawn to our attention by Mr Paul Salmon of Salans, the City law firm.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Under the Companies Act 1985, companies were able to make a small charge for providing copies of all constitutional documents to members who requested them. As far as we can see&#151;and we stand to be corrected&#151;this Bill appears to make no provision in that respect. That seems wrong when the documents can in any case be obtained from the registrar of companies. The removal of the ability to charge for documents also raises the risk that this entitlement could be used vexatiously or frivolously. As currently worded, any member, even if he held only a single share, could repeatedly request copies of that information at no expense to himself yet at some expense and administrative trouble to the company. The amendment seeks to allow companies to make a reasonable charge for providing such information. It is hoped that this will reduce any incentive to make frivolous or vexatious requests, ensure that the company is not out of pocket at least financially for complying with any request, yet not unduly inhibit shareholders who have legitimate reasons for requesting to see the documents. That is Amendment No. 36.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Amendment No. 37 seeks to impose a parallel limit to the number of times a company can be required to provide copies of documents to members at their request to one such request or one such compliance every 12 months. The reasoning behind the argument is the same as that advanced in respect of Amendment No. 36; namely, preventing the abuse of this right for frivolous and vexatious purposes. Obviously, we are seeking to strike a balance. On the one hand, companies should not be endlessly tied up, perhaps repeatedly providing documents to members who may be requesting them for no proper purpose or motive. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

On the other hand, shareholders clearly have a legitimate right to ask for copies of documents once each year. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="60130-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   These amendments would enable companies to charge a reasonable amount for providing information. For all practical purposes, the current Act hardly allows companies to make such charges. It caps the charge that can be made at only 5p. It is not clear to me that companies find that they are burdened with costs. In part, this may be because the costs of providing information are falling heavily the more use is made of electronic communications. Other provisions in this Bill make it much easier for companies to use such technologies in communicating with their shareholders, where both parties agree. Against this background, the introduction of provision for full charging would seem to me to send the wrong signals.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As regards Amendment No. 37, I can see cases where it would be essential to have information more frequently than once every 12 months. An exception is where such information has changed. I cannot help feeling that the courts would not take seriously a case in which someone failed to give the same information when it was asked for on a frequent basis. These amendments are not necessary in these circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60130-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   The Minister&#039;s answer was given in the context of larger companies. A huge number of relatively small companies are formed, for example, to hold the freehold property and to carry out two or three transactions a year on behalf of the people who share the property. It frequently arises that one or other of the shareholders who is interested in a part of the property seems to need access to another part of the company&#039;s memorandum, articles or any other legal document, and there seems to be a stream of requests because people do not value bits of information they are given for free.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Once information has been provided, there should be an ability to charge shareholders if they request the same information again. The needs of small companies are perhaps not met by the Minister&#039;s reply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60130-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   You cannot put a limit on this by saying that the information can be requested only once a year.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 38, I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 41. These two amendments are both technical and do not make any alteration of substance.

The amendment tidies up the grammar in consequence.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Clause 37 is intended merely to replicate the effect of the provisions of Section 15 of the 1985 Act and this amendment corrects an omission. Section 15(1) prevents a company limited by guarantee, which cannot be incorporated with a share capital, attempting through provisions in its articles or any resolution, to create a share capital by the back door, either by provisions distributing profits in a particular way or by dividing an interest or undertaking into shares. The restriction is on the participation in profits otherwise than as a member. There is no restriction on members of a company limited by guarantee participating in profits. Clause 5 prevents the incorporation of companies limited by guarantee with a share capital, and hence the provisions of Section 15(1) of the Companies Act 1985 are restated in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Unfortunately, the crucial words &quot;limited by guarantee&quot; have been inadvertently omitted, with the effect of extending the scope of the provision to all companies without a share capital, and in so doing including some unlimited companies, which are not subject to the equivalent provision of the 1985 Act and which there was no intention of capturing. The amendment corrects this error. I beg to move.

<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I give the reasons for moving the amendment, I should say, first, that I apologise for any meeting of the Grand Committee that I am forced to be absent from which is likely to arise in the near future. Secondly, I regret that this important Bill&#151;I almost said, &quot;This hugely important Bill&quot;, as it is huge&#151;which is even possibly in some respects a controversial Bill, has been given over to a Grand Committee process. Your Lordships heard recently from the Procedure Committee the reasons why we should try to keep Third Reading for its traditional use. The more Bills that are sent to Grand Committee, the more difficulty your Lordships will have in observing that very good rule.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The reason for this amendment is perhaps of greater importance than at first appears because it tests our attitude to the Bill. Your Lordships will know that the memorandum and articles, which we must now call the constitution of the company, is contractually binding as between each pair of members and as between the company and the member. This is of great importance for various areas of company law, not least the area of personal rights of members to which we shall come later.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The problem was created in previous companies Acts and, indeed, arose as early as 1844 and then in the Act of 1856. Rather than go through the effect of the history I shall quote from the seventh edition of Gower&#039;s <i>Principles of Modern Company Law</i> edited by a distinguished company law scholar, Professor Davies, who states at page 58 in regard to the 1856 Act, which installed the memorandum and articles as the constitution:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;Unhappily, full account was not taken of the vital new factor (namely that the incorporated company was a separate legal entity) and the words &#039;as if . . . signed and sealed by each member&#039; did not have added to them &#039;and by the company&#039;. This oddity has survived into the modern Acts&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60130-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>When the Bill was printed, it repeated the oddity; namely, that this was a contract between members in <i>inter se. </i>It did not change the traditional formula. However, the traditional formula had been sensibly interpreted by the courts to mean that this contract was binding not only between members but also as between each member and the company. If that had been left as it was, there would be no need to move any amendment to it. But if the Bill ever alters a traditional phrase in company law, the case for interpreting it is not necessarily finally indubitably binding. The Government amendment, which my noble friend moved, does exactly the same with the traditional phrase and states that it is binding as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;if there were covenants, signed and sealed on the part of each member, to observe those provisions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a> I can think of no reason why today we should not state what we mean. We mean what the courts have said it should mean; namely, that it is signed and sealed on the part of the company and of each member to observe those provisions.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>That is not mere academic or fanciful exercise. I had thought of situations where it might be raised, but it would leave it, without this amendment, open to a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC36"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

litigant to argue that the new formula means what it says. After all, someone in court is likely to say, &quot;The legislature considered this formula. They not only considered it, signed and sealed by each member, they put it in a new form and retained it. So they must mean what they say. Therefore, the cases from 1915 and onwards that say the company is bound by the contract perhaps are open to question&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>We should not waste litigation time and expense with even the remotest possibility of such an argument being acceptable. That is why I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60130-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, reminded us, Clause 35 has a long pedigree. It has been part of our company law since 1856&#151;the noble Lord mentioned an earlier date&#151;when it first appeared in Sections 7 and 10 of the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856. It has remained unchanged for 150 years, give or take some changes in the description of the contractual formalities and the new reference to &quot;constitution&quot; which reflects other changes introduced by the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>On the face of it, it may seem odd that the provision refers to the constitution binding both company and its members, but then goes on to describe the contractual relationship which it establishes in terms of covenants signed and sealed by the members only. On the other hand, one might ask whether it would be any less odd to imagine the company signing up to these covenants before the process of registration has brought it into being.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In any event, odd as the approach adopted by the 1856 draftsman and his successors may have been, it was some 60 years before the possible difficulties in his drafting were subjected to comprehensive judicial analysis in the case brought in 1914 by Mr Hickman as a member and flock owner against the Kent and Romney Marsh Sheep Breeders&#039; Association.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The textbooks dwell on the difficulties facing the judge in that case in terms of the working of the legislation and the conflicting authorities citied to him by counsel. But he succeeded in reconciling those authorities and in drawing out three clear principles, which he summarised as follows. First, that no article can constitute a contract between the company and a third person. Secondly, that no right merely purporting to be given by an article to a person in a capacity other than that of a member can be enforced against a company. Thirdly, that articles regulating the rights and obligations of the members generally as such create rights and obligations between them and the company respectively.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Whatever confusion may have existed before the judgment in Hickman&#039;s case, the principles that it established have not been seriously challenged in 90 years and have become a well-established part of company law. It is of course true, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, pointed out almost 50 years ago in his seminal article on the rule in <i>Foss</i> v <i>Harbottle</i>, that some of those principles can lead to anomalous results in particular cases; for example, where a director who is also a member can enforce provisions of the constitution as a member which he would not have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been able to enforce merely as a director. But notwithstanding the valuable work of the Company Law Review in this area, we have yet to be convinced that there is anything better and clearer, or indeed as clear, to be put in place of the Hickman rules.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a> This Bill radically reforms some parts of our company law, but it does not set out to change everything. We do not think that we have an answer to every potential problem in current company law, and we are wary of imposing radical solutions where we are not sure how much of a problem there really is in practice. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, reminded us, it is important to be clear where we are changing the law and where we are just modernising the drafting. If it is not already clear from the text of Clause 35, I say now that the effect of a company&#039;s constitution is not an area in which we want to introduce substantive changes.
</p>

<a name="60130-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>We accept that the historic drafting is odd, but we believe that its meaning is well understood. We see no reason to depart from it in the direction proposed by the noble Lord unless we want to change the meaning of the clause, but that would in turn change the effect of other provisions as well, such as those on shareholder remedies. We will of course study the arguments advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, with all the care that his unique authority in this field commands, but as things stand we have yet to be persuaded of the merits of making the change that he proposes, because we fear that any benefits that it may bring could be outweighed by the unforeseen dangers inherent in disturbing one of the cornerstones of our company law.

</p>

<a name="60130-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>This is another issue on which we have had discussions with the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The amendment seeks to simplify the Bill by having the methods by which any company can execute documents brought together in one subsection rather than as currently drafted in two subsections. In Part 12, the Bill removes the requirement for a private company to have a secretary, which we discussed earlier. As a further step, it also, as the Minister mentioned, removes much of the official capacity of a secretary in any company that may choose to have a secretary but is not required to have one.
</p>

<a name="60130-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Section 36A(4) of the Companies Act 1985 allows any company to execute a document under the signature of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;a director and the secretary of a company, or by two directors of a company&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>That position is retained in respect of public companies in this Bill by Clause 44(3)(a). However, there is no logical reason why the removal of the requirement for private companies to have a company secretary in this Bill&#151;Clause 247&#151;should prevent those companies that continue to have a secretary to execute documents under their signature. Indeed, it may be a hindrance for some companies not to have that capability. The amendment would retain that flexibility for those private companies that retain a secretary. If they do not have a secretary, they would have to execute documents under the signature of two directors or a director and a witness&#151;Clause 44(3)(b) and (c).
</p>

<a name="60130-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The amendment seeks to give effect to this argument by allowing any company to validly execute a document by signature of a director and a secretary, if it has one. If a company does not have a secretary, obviously that procedure cannot be followed. However, seems no need for subsection (2) and, in the interests of brevity and deregulation, we seek its removal. That is the purpose of Amendments Nos. 43 and 44.
</p>

<a name="60130-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Amendment No. 53 concerns Clause 48, &quot;Authentication of documents&quot;. This clause makes a change from the corresponding section&#151;Section 41&#151;of the Companies Act 1985, which included secretaries in the list of persons who may sufficiently authenticate documents by signature. Despite the Government&#039;s desire to minimise the number of companies who require secretaries, we see no reason why those companies who have secretaries should see their role diminished. The amendment therefore seeks to reinstate the meaning that we have lost from Section 41 of the Companies Act 1985. But, in the first instance, I beg to move Amendment No. 43.

</p>

<a name="60130-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Clause 44 is essentially deregulatory. It widens the options for a company executing a deed. As now, a company will be able to execute a deed either by affixing its seal, if it has one, or by the signature of two directors. Any company, both private and public, will also be able to do so by the signature of one director if witnessed by another person&#151;for example, the secretary. So, whether or not the company has a secretary, the company will still be able to execute the deed, provided somebody witnesses a lone director&#039;s signature.
</p>

<a name="60130-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>We need to consider the needs of both parties to the deed. The other party knows immediately from the name of the company whether it is a private or a public company, but it will not be immediately apparent whether it has a secretary. The distinction in this clause therefore is between public and private companies.
</p>

<a name="60130-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Any company that has a seal will continue to be able to set its own conditions for the affixing of its seal for the execution of documents. I understand that this is often delegated to the secretary alone for some categories of document. It will also continue to be open to the company to empower its secretary as its attorney to execute deeds on its behalf. There is no need for any special provision for private companies with company secretaries.
</p>

<a name="60130-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Compared with the present position, the clause introduces more flexibility for all companies, not less. It in no way hinders the execution of a document by a private company that chooses to continue to have a secretary. I therefore do not support Amendments Nos. 43, 46 or 47.

</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 48 seeks to close a loophole whereby one person could unilaterally exclude a document on behalf of the company. That point was again put to us by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. As drafted, it appears that one person who was both director and secretary to the company could exploit this loophole, which is surely an undesirable consequence for a multitude of reasons. By requiring that the director and secretary who sign the document should not be the same person, it is ensured that at least two members of the company are aware of the execution of the document, thus reducing the scope for any malpractice by a single rogue director. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="60130-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The purpose of the amendment is wholly sound, but I will nevertheless resist it. It is clearly right that when executing a document for a company, a single person who is both a director and a secretary of the company should not be able to sign it twice to fulfil the obligation under the clause. Indeed, that protection should not apply only to the execution of documents. That is why Clause 257 provides:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;In the case of a public company, a provision requiring or authorising a thing to be done by or to a director and the secretary of a company is not satisfied by its being done by or to the same person acting both as director and as, or in place of, the secretary&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60130-47_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I oppose the Motion that Clause 45 stand part of the Bill. The clause has the rather strange title, &quot;Common seal&quot;, and even stranger wording:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;A company may have a common seal, but need not have one&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>It provides for companies to have a common seal, but I question the use of common seals for companies in the modern world. They appear to be no guarantee of authenticity; I am told that anyone can order a common seal of any design with no checks on their authority to do so. One could, theoretically, order the common seal of any company that one wished to and attempt to pass it off as an official common seal. It is now prevalent common practice for companies to execute documents by the methods in Clause 44(3), for example signing by two directors. The common seal is therefore superfluous in modern business.
</p>

<a name="60130-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>We may be hanging on to an outdated tradition that no longer serves any useful purpose. If we are to be keen on deregulation, it would be straightforward to excise the clause from the Bill. The alternative would be to tighten up the laws relating to common seals, their acquisition and their use. I am sure that that is a step that the business community would not appreciate, and it is not one that we, in looking to create the company law of the future, should take.

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60130-47_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The clause is needed to retain the existing option for companies of whether to have a seal. Following consultation on this issue in their 1998 report, <i>The Execution of Deeds and Documents by or on behalf of Bodies Corporate</i>, the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission recommended:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;That the present &#039;dual system&#039; should be retained, so that companies may continue to execute deeds either under the common seal or by the signature of relevant persons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Without that clause, companies would no longer have a genuine choice whether to have a seal. In the consultation in 1996, the Law Commission sought views on whether the dual system for execution of deeds should be retained. In the consultation document, the Law Commission noted that while some consider execution under seal to be an archaic practice and an administrative burden, others value having execution under seal for the following reasons. It probably offers a greater guarantee of authenticity than execution by the signature of officers alone; it involves greater formality and may enhance the company&#039;s own controls; it may be required in some <br>&nbsp;<br>

jurisdictions; it may offer greater flexibility as non-directors may be authorised to affix the seal. The responses were almost unanimously in favour of retaining the dual system.

<a name="60130-48_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   Can the Minister explain the apparent inconsistency between the Government&#039;s position that, if a company chooses to retain a common seal, which it does not need to, the legal status and efficacy of the common seal is retained under the Bill, whereas a private company may retain the office of secretary, but the official and legal status of the secretary is abolished under the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60130-48_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I do not believe that there is an inconsistency. As I explained when we debated previous amendments, the secretary can be authorised as a witness or to execute the seal on behalf of the company. I do not see an inconsistency there.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60130-48_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply, but the common seal does not need to be authorised on behalf of the company in order to be a common seal. If the company has a common seal, it is recognised in law and has legal status. I quite understand what the Minister said about the role of secretary, but the automatic role of the company secretary is abolished by the Bill, even in the case of companies that have opted to retain the office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60130-48_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   With due respect, the noble Viscount answered his own question. In one case there is recognition, even though it is optional, but the seal has a role in company law. In the case of the secretary, that is an optional arrangement whereby the formal requirements and status have been removed.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="60130-48_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I accept the Minister&#039;s comment that the consultation showed support for the measure in the English and the Scottish legal communities. I think that he said that the consultation was from 1996 to 1998. I suspect that the world has moved on quite a lot since then. I suspect that the issue and use of seals has diminished markedly over time, for the reasons that I tried to explain: there is insufficient authentication of them; and, more and more, documents are signed by two directors. That is certainly the practice that I have seen develop and the seal is slipping to the edge of history. I was just trying to push it over the edge with a raft and get rid of it once and for all.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 47 is about execution of deeds abroad. The amendments have been suggested to us by the Law Society and would remove an existing ambiguity by clarifying that a company can execute a deed or any other document by empowering an attorney to do so on its behalf within, as well as outside, the United Kingdom. Clause 47 re-enacts Section 38 of the Companies Act 1985, without changing the intention of the provision. There are uncertainties whether the present provision enables a company to authorise an attorney to execute documents other than deeds on its behalf.
</p>

<a name="60130-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>These amendments would specifically allow an attorney to execute a deed or any other document on behalf of the company. The amendments would also enable a company to use the services of an attorney to act in this capacity on its behalf both within and outside the United Kingdom. Only the latter is provided for in the clause as drafted. This could save companies the time and expense of sending a director or directors across the country to execute a deed on its behalf.

During their consultation over the execution of deeds and documents, the two bodies explicitly sought views on,

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Clause 56 provides the Secretary of State with the power to make regulations on the use of sensitive words or expressions in a company&#039;s name.

</p>

<a name="60130-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The uncertainty of the scope of the clause is largely caused by the use of the word &quot;registered&quot; on its own in Clause 56(1).

They include chamber of commerce, charity, dental, duke, European, friendly society, Her Majesty, international, national, nurse, police, royal, stock exchange, trade union and Wales.

<a name="60130-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The aim is to ensure that the use of sensitive words is justified so that the public are not misled by the company&#039;s name. We intend to consult over the new regulations. These will update the existing regulations both by removing and adding words and expressions. No draft regulation is available at present. I assure the Committee that if a word is added to the list that is part of an existing company&#039;s name, that existing company would not be required to change its name: there is no power to require a change in such circumstances.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to a group of three amendments: Amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 60. They still concern Clause 57 and the &quot;Duty to seek comments&quot;. They would remove an anomaly whereby a statement that a request has been made under the clause must be included&#151;note the word &quot;included&quot;&#151;in any application. Clauses 55 to 57 provide a system whereby a company can apply to the Secretary of State to use sensitive words and expressions in its name. Clause 57 provides for the making of regulations, with a requirement for such companies to seek the review of any public authority to which the proposed name would refer&#151;for example, a government or local authority body. If the current wording is retained, the application for registration of a new company would have to include provision for the statement required under Clause 57(3). It would surely be more logical for the statement to be made in a separate document. That is what we seek to achieve by Amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 60. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="60130-49_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Before I respond to the amendment, perhaps I may use this opportunity to refer to a matter that we previously discussed. I may have created some confusion about whether the term &quot;deemed&quot; includes documents. We do not think that it does and will therefore look again at Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 when considering Amendment No. 51. I apologise to the Committee for that.
</p>

<a name="60130-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>On the amendments, it seems that there may be concern about the drafting of the clause and its effect on applications to register companies. The issue is whether the clause requires the application form to include special provision for a statement for certain types of company name. I do not consider there to be any good grounds for concern. Clause 9, which sets out the requirements for the application for registration, does not refer to an application form; and nor does the clause. Both specify that information must be provided. The registrar will determine how the information is to be provided, whether on one form, on two or otherwise. In any event, the increasing use of electronic communications means that it will become much less important to talk about &quot;forms&quot;. I therefore consider the amendment unnecessary.

Again, some anxiety has been expressed about when regulations will be produced for Clauses 55 and 58. At this point all I seek is the same undertaking the Minister was able to give in respect of Clause 55; namely, that there is no possibility that a company will be forced to change its name.

<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60130-50_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I want to add a word to the remarks just made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. The particular concern here relates to a company name that was perfectly legitimate when the company was incorporated, but which has in its name a character or symbol which is subsequently prescribed. The example of concern to the Law Society is an obvious one: an &quot;a&quot; with a circle around it, a symbol commonly used in email addresses. Let us suppose that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, when he retires from his august position, decides to set up a company called &quot;Lord Sainsbury @ Turville Limited&quot;. Were the use of that symbol subsequently to be prescribed under these regulations, the noble Lord&#151;who may by then be running the most successful competitor to Tesco in the world&#151;would be required to change the name of his company at enormous personal expense. So the concern of the Law Society is that the Minister should make it clear that, in those circumstances, companies will not be required to change their name and that the regulations will so provide.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 62 seeks to align the clause with the corresponding provision in Section 19 of the Companies Act 1985.
</p>

<a name="60130-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>As is referred to in paragraph 153 of the Explanatory Notes, this introduces a new requirement that a company limited by shares, which relies on a licence under Section 19 of the Companies Act 1985 in order to omit &quot;limited&quot; from its name, may have to change its constitution so as to prohibit the return of capital to its members if it wishes to continue to rely on the exemption. This has cost implications for such companies, although Clause 64(4) provides some relief in that it removes any requirement to obtain the consent of the Board of Trade or the Charity Commission for such a change. I note that a government amendment has been tabled which may have some impact on the measure, but this issue has been raised by the Law Society. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60130-50_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This clause applies only to companies limited by shares that, by virtue of a licence, are exempt from the requirement for their name to conclude in &quot;limited&quot;. There are just 21 GB companies of this type that are still active. This is partly because the provisions of the Companies Act 1948, under which licences were granted, were repealed in 1982. Those provisions applied to companies formed for promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or other public-benefit type objects.
</p>

<a name="60130-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>So this clause is about companies limited by shares that are not-for-profit companies. It is inappropriate for them to pay dividends to their members. For similar reasons it is inappropriate for them to buy back their members&#039; shares or return capital to them in other ways.
</p>

<a name="60130-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The issue of returning capital does not arise under the current law. This is because, if a company wants to reduce its capital or buy back its own shares, it needs special provision in its articles. However, companies with a licence under the 1948 Act cannot usually amend their articles without permission from the DTI.
</p>

<a name="60130-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Two bits of deregulation in the Bill affect this. The first is that companies will be able to reduce their capital and buy back their own shares without special provision in their articles. The second is in Clause 64. We are doing away with the need for exempt companies to apply to the DTI for approval when they amend their articles.
</p>

<a name="60130-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>There is a steady stream of applications to the DTI from exempt companies seeking to change their articles. Clause 64 represents useful deregulation for those companies. However, to ensure that exempt <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="60130-51_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This amendment concerns how a company changes its name to comply with a direction that it should include &quot;limited&quot; or a permitted alternative. It stipulates that there should be only one method&#151;a resolution of the directors. This is effectively the present position. However, we need to view the present position in the context of the general rules on changing a company&#039;s name. Section 28 of the 1985 Act requires a special resolution. The special resolution procedure can be time consuming and it is arguably better to give the directors responsibility for changing the name in response to a direction.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>By contrast, Clause 77 provides that a company may change its name not only by special resolution but also by other means provided for in the company&#039;s articles. Clause 65 expressly provides the directors with the power to change the company&#039;s name in these circumstances to ensure that it is possible for the company to comply with the direction in the specified period. But, just because the company has been directed to change its name, it should not be deprived of the freedom to change its name by other means.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 68 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="60130-51_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   In opposing the Motion, I shall speak first to Amendment No. 68, relating to Clause 69, that makes supplementary provisions to Clause 68 relating to the power to change a company&#039;s name. The amendment was raised with us by the Law Society and seeks to adopt the time limit for directions that was recommended by the Company Law Review.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Clause 69 deals with the directions that the Secretary of State may give to a company to change its name if that name is similar to that of an existing company. The time limit with which the amendment deals is the deadline by which a company in receipt of such a direction must change its name. We support the Company Law Review recommendation that the time limit should be set at 15 months. Why have the Government decided on 12 months instead?
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>That takes me to the wider issue of the powers in Clause 68 upon which Amendment No. 68 depends. We have grave doubts about the value of the clause, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other than perhaps at a symbolic level. Therefore, we seek its removal on both practical and deregulatory grounds.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>First, the powers in the clause are very wide. The matters that may be covered in subsections (2) and (3) are so broad as to provide no framework for companies to make a reasonable assessment of the grounds on which the Secretary of State may intervene. Secondly, the powers are in any case ineffective; even if a name is not available, there is nothing to stop a company, registered under one name, from trading under another. Therefore, the Secretary of State can direct a company to change its registered name under the power contained in Clause 68, but that might have no effect on the name that the company chooses to trade under and it is, of course, the trading name, not the registered name, where the commercial issues and interests lie. Thirdly, why does the Secretary of State need this power? If company &quot;A&quot; believes that its operations and profitability have been damaged by company &quot;B&quot; seeking to pass itself off as company &quot;A&quot;, it can bring a civil case for damages.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Fourthly, our research suggests that this power is rarely, if ever, used. I would be interested to know, if not this evening then at some point, how many times the Secretary of State has exercised his power under the corresponding section of the Companies Act 1985, Section 28(2). The information we received during our consultation on that section is that it is, in practice, hard to persuade the registrar to take any action whatever in that regard. So, on the grounds of deregulation, of effectiveness, of the availability of alternative legal remedies and of use, we seek the removal of the clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="60130-51_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I shall deal with both issues together. Regarding the statistics, less than one per cent of all name changes are as a result of the direction. Between April and November last year, 166 companies were directed to change their names because they were too much like another&#039;s.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The clause, like its predecessor in the 1985 Act, is there to prevent confusion between very similar names on the registrar&#039;s index. We propose to make regulations under Clause 67 to deal with some common, minor differences between names. For example, under the current law, &quot;Smith Limited&quot; and &quot;Smith and Co. Limited&quot; are taken as the same and only one can be registered. However, it is impossible to provide for all minor differences in this mechanical way. That is why we need Clause 68. It operates after a company name has been registered and allows the Secretary of State to direct changes of name.
</p>

<a name="60130-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 68, the Company Law Review recommended that the time limit for directing a change of name because it is &quot;too like&quot; another should be extended to 15 months, as the noble Lord stated. At the same time, the review recommended that objections to the name should be made within 12 months. However, that pair of recommendations was falsely based on the premise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the registrar considers arguments or representations. In fact, the registrar simply applies a visual test&#151;might the company name be mistaken for another? This does not require an extra three months after the period for objections. The period during which a company may be directed to change its newly-adopted name is one of uncertainty for the company. I do not consider that it should be extended without good reason.

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Clause 7 provides a process whereby a person can lodge an objection to a company&#039;s registered name. It would be fair for there to be a point beyond which a company knows that it can no longer face such an objection. It would be undesirable for a company to be formed and incur substantial start-up and ongoing costs, yet months or even years later be faced with an application under the clause. Therefore, a short time frame would be appropriate; a period of six months from the company&#039;s registration would provide ample time for any person wishing to lodge an objection.

</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="60130-52_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This clause is the first of a group intended to address a particular abuse of the registration process whereby a company is registered in a name chosen to exploit the value of someone else&#039;s reputation or goodwill. The classic case is where an opportunist sees that the company may want to register a particular name, perhaps in the context of a merger, and registers it himself in the hope that he can, in effect, sell it on. The new procedure will provide a firm legal basis on which companies that are used as vehicles for opportunistic registration may be ordered to change their names. This will be a quick and easy way of resolving such disputes.
</p>

<a name="60130-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Owing to the nature of opportunistic registrations, they usually come to light quite quickly. If someone registers a name because they want, in effect, to sell it on, they are unlikely to keep quiet about it for long. However, imposing a time limit for bringing a claim before an adjudicator would leave scope for abuse. Imagine someone registers the names of a number of partnerships in the hope that they will become LLPs and need the registered name. That may not come to light for some time. It may be that the amendment is to ensure that after a certain time companies will be able to keep their names. However, a company operating under a name with no intention of selling the name or blocking its use by someone else has nothing to fear from the procedure. They cannot be subject to a successful challenge.
</p>

<a name="60130-52_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I listened carefully to what he said, but I did not understand why there should be no time limit. I can understand why he might object to the six months as not giving sufficient time for the information to spread around the marketplace, but I would have thought that the remarks he made earlier about the need for reducing commercial uncertainty argued in favour of there being some period&#151;maybe 12 months&#151;that would match with the amendment that we were discussing a minute ago.

Even if one of the two grounds are found to be true, the respondent may still be able to keep the registered name if a number of conditions are met, one of which is that the company is already operating under the name or has incurred substantial start-up costs in preparation for using the name. Our concern today is the definition of what constitutes &quot;substantial&quot; start-up costs. What may be substantial <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for a sole trader setting up a single shop may well be peanuts compared to a multinational. How will that be judged?
</p>

<a name="60130-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>In my experience, a large company can from time to time act heavy handedly in that regard. First, an individual quite a long way down the management chain may be taking a decision, so finding out who is responsible may be difficult for a small company. Subsequently, getting senior management to focus on the issue, which may be trivial to them but important to the small company, can be equally hard. In my professional life, a small company with which I was associated had the idea of setting up a chain of gift shops called, &quot;The Elephant Forgets&quot;. It incurred substantial costs in setting up the name and opening a shop, but a large retail outfit blew them out of the water. I would have liked the small company to have been protected from that, because it was entirely <i>bona fide</i>. However, I am not clear from the clause how what would have been the substantial costs of setting up the shop and registering the name, &quot;The Elephant Forgets&quot; would have been interpreted.
</p>

<a name="60130-52_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Obviously, this is a probing amendment. We seek to define substantial start-up costs as being relative to the size of the company that has incurred them, thereby protecting small businesses from being muscled out by large businesses who can afford to throw more money at a name just for the purpose of being able to secure it. On that rather commercial basis, I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="60130-53_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I understand the thrust behind the amendment, but I am a little surprised at how it has been proposed. It is usual for a company that is being used as a vehicle for opportunistic registration to have a very low turnover and a small asset base. Often, it will be a company purchased off the shelf with a name that the buyer thinks has some value. That means that by the measure suggested in the amendment, any start-up costs are likely to be substantial. If a company&#039;s start-up costs are substantial, an objection under the clause is less likely to be upheld quickly. Surely that is not to the advantage of the person making the objection.
</p>




<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="60130-53_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   By having a test relative to the size of the company, one protects smaller companies much more than by a test that has no scaling at all. To take the example of supermarkets&#151;to which we always seem to return; that is unfortunate&#151;start-up costs for a small store or chain could be substantial for that company, but trifling for a major chain. One must be able to apply the test differently. That is about protecting the smaller company rather than creating any obstacles or difficulties for it.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_222"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments and the clauses keep running parallel; this is Amendment No. 72 on Clause 72. We are on procedural rules for the company names adjudicator. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, referred earlier this afternoon to England and Wales being a House of Lords issue; this is another House of Lords issue. The clause provides a power for the Secretary of State to make rules about proceedings before a company names adjudicator. It states a list of things that the rules may make provision for, such as time limits or striking out. The list of issues is contained in paragraphs (a) to (k) of subsection (2). All of those seem perfectly sensible; indeed one might argue that they are fundamental to the work of the company names adjudicator. So far so good; but in the introduction to subsection (2), the wording reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;The rules may . . . make provision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-53_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I return to the familiar issue of why &quot;may&quot; and not &quot;shall&quot;. It is hard to see that the adjudicator could work without the powers granted in paragraphs (a) to (k). If one or more were missed out, he could be hamstrung. To make sure that he can be fully effective, we seek to replace &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60130-53_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>As I have said, this is a familiar case, but I make no apology for returning to it. Ministers may argue that &quot;may&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; are interchangeable. They pray in aid parliamentary draftsmen. I do not accept that argument; if I say I may do something it is not the same as when I say I shall do something. If parliamentary draftsmen argue that it is the same, they and I live in different worlds; which is probably an accurate reflection of the truth.
</p>

<a name="60130-53_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The other leg of the argument against this type of amendment is normally that the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; is too prescriptive; that it excludes additional powers other than those allowed under paragraphs (a) <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

to (k). I do not accept that; the inclusion of the phrase &quot;in particular&quot; means that what follows is not an exclusive list. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="60130-53_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The noble Lord has pre-empted my response. Subsection (2) lists various matters that the company names adjudicator&#039;s procedural rules might include. That ensures that there is no doubt that the rules can extend to those matters.

</p>




<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="60130-53_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   That was certainly predictable. What is interesting about this is that if we look at Grand Committee on Wednesday 25 January 2006, which is only last week, my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral moved an amendment to the Compensation Bill. The schedule was about the grant of authorisations, and it read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>&quot;Regulations may prescribe the procedure for applying to the Regulator for authorisation&quot;.</p>

So, it may be a House of Lords issue, but last week the Government accepted that &quot;may&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; were different and that, in respect of the Compensation Bill, the appropriate word was &quot;shall&quot; and not &quot;may&quot;. Without seeking to be petty about this, I hope that the Minister will think again.

The fate of the nation is not going to hang on this, but we come across it in Bill after Bill with &quot;may&quot;, &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;in particular&quot;. We could achieve clarity. To the man in the street &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;may&quot; are quite different, and &quot;in particular&quot; means that this list is not all-encompassing. I do not think that the parliamentary draftsmen&#151;and my respect for them knows no bounds&#151;have got this quite right in generality, as well as tonight. I will not detain the Minister: we have been at this for four hours. I hope that the noble Lord might have another look at it and see whether he can bring forward an amendment at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="60130-53_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 73:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>Page 30, line 32, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;(   )   requiring the publication of all decisions by the adjudicator within 90 days of the decision being given.&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column GC62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_228"></a>The noble Lord said: We are still on the procedural rules under Clause 73. The amendment adds to the list of rules that the Secretary of State shall make provision for and requires the adjudicator to publish his decisions within 90 days of the decision being given. The purpose is to ensure that not only is justice done, but that it is also seen to be done, which is an important keystone of our judicial system and one that this adjudicator of company names should follow.
</p>

<a name="60130-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The amendment would have the added benefit of allowing other companies to keep abreast of the decisions in this area, thereby avoiding making similar mistakes. By publishing the decisions of other cases, companies can be better informed about their own position and make decisions accordingly. In such areas, where companies can risk substantial sums of money and considerable effort in developing new business, it is surely desirable to have as much certainty as possible. This amendment is one way of creating some of that certainty.
</p>

<a name="60130-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The second part of the amendment seeks to impose a timetable to ensure a reasonably speedy publication by the adjudicator of any decisions that he may take. If it is important that justice is seen to be done, it is no less important that publication should be reasonably speedy. Ninety days seems a fair maximum period. Therefore, I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This amendment is not necessary. The purpose of the procedure is that if a company has a name chosen to exploit another&#039;s goodwill, it can be required to change its name to one that does not similarly offend. If it does not comply, its name will be changed by the adjudicator. I am not sure what further purpose would be served by compulsory publicity for the outcome. If hearings are held in public, there is nothing to stop them being reported. This principle works well enough for the courts and it should work here too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I only partially accept that. First, I do not believe that Clause 72(2)(j) requires proceedings to be held in public. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;as to how far proceedings are to be held in public&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60130-54_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>so it could be that the proceedings were in private. Secondly, there is always a danger that if these issues are not publicised speedily, good practice is not widely spread. One of the issues we had with the Charities Bill was the way in which the charity tribunals would work. We were most anxious to ensure that they would work speedily&#151;these things can become enmeshed in bureaucracy and result in delay&#151;that a decision should be reached speedily and that it should be publicised. People could then learn from it. Others perhaps in this case seeking who would play fast and loose with an authorised name and therefore incur the wrath of this procedure might be dissuaded from so doing. I do not accept all the Minister says&#151;

<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Grabiner: </b>   I intervene only to say that there is nothing in the provision to inhibit the complaining party from going public. One would have expected that it would have been in the interests of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

complaining party to go public in order to preserve good will in his own name. One would ordinarily expect the publicity to come from that direction without the need to impose any obligation on the adjudicator to produce the same result.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   That is a perfectly fair point. The concern on these Benches is that where you have a David and Goliath, the ability of David to gain publicity is quite limited due, for example, to human constraints, the size of the operation, financial resources and so on.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Grabiner: </b>   One frequently forgets that David won the battle.

<a name="60130-54_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Army: Future Structures </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60130-54_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60130-54_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>My predecessor announced to the House in December 2004 (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 1795), that under the Future Army Structures, we intend to re-role an Armoured Brigade to a Mechanised Brigade and a Mechanised Brigade to a Light Brigade.
</p>

<a name="60130-54_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>I am now in a position to confirm that 4th   Armoured Brigade will re-role to a Mechanised Brigade in 2006 and will move from its current base in Osnabruck garrison in Germany to Catterick in 2008&#150;09. A number of other minor adjustments will also be made. I have notified the German Government of our plans. 19 Brigade will re-role to a Light Brigade and will subsequently relocate away from Catterick to Scotland and Northern Ireland, although decisions on the final location of individual units have yet to be taken. We hope to be in a position to announce this later in the year. The net effect will be a reduction of our forces in Germany by roughly 2,200 personnel.
</p>

<a name="60130-54_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>While there may be further modest adjustments to our force levels in Germany in the coming years where this makes sense, I would envisage sizeable forces remaining there for the long-term, where they will continue to enjoy excellent relations with the local population and contribute to our strong bilateral relationship with the German Government.

Conclusions are also expected to underline the continuing importance of full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) by both Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government welcome the EU-Western Balkans ministerial as a chance to re-endorse the Thessaloniki messages of 2003 and focus on some hearts and minds initiatives to support the political process.

</p>

<a name="60130-55_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Informal Council was held on 19&#150;21 January in Villach, Austria.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs (Gerry Sutcliffe) and I attended the working session for the UK.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The Austrian presidency posed two topics for discussion on Friday 20 January. The morning session discussed &quot;Flexicurity&#151;flexibility through Security&quot;. The afternoon session discussed &quot;The Social dimension of the revised Lisbon strategy and the streamlining of social policy processes&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>My honourable friend represented the UK during the morning discussion of &quot;Flexicurity&quot;. This session explored new ways of balancing flexibility and social and employment security in Europe.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>Member States took examples from their national reform programmes to illustrate the balance they had struck between flexibility and security. For the UK, my honourable friend suggested that legislative measures were for the national level and the EU could add value by sharing experience and good practice and by promoting better regulation principles.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The Commissioner noted that &quot;flexicurity&quot; would be addressed in the Commission green paper on labour law, due in the first half of the year.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Overall, Ministers agreed that there is no one size fits all model for flexicurity, but disagreed whether legislative action should be taken at the EU level.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The afternoon session asked Ministers to focus on the presidency question about the social dimension of the strategy for growth and jobs and the desired role and outputs for streamlined open method of co-ordination of social policies.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>For the UK, I called for practical discussion about real policies rather than theoretical debate of principles. I suggested that the aim should be to integrate social policy making within an overall reform strategy where it could contribute to the delivery of employment aims.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>There was a consensus that a visible social dimension to the Lisbon strategy must be maintained and that streamlining open method of co-ordination would help.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>The presidency then proposed that Employment Ministers should feed these messages into the spring European Council.

<a name="60130-55_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>In my Statement on 12 December, following my appearance at the Public Administration Select Committee oral evidence session on the operation of the FEPOW Scheme, I told the House that I had commissioned a review into the extent to which inconsistent eligibility criteria had been used for deciding claims before and after the introduction of the birth-link criterion; this work is well-advanced. In addition, I said that a separate, independent investigation would be conducted into how the use of inconsistent criteria had arisen and why it had not been exposed earlier. I said that this work would be undertaken by a retired senior official from outside of the departments involved. I am pleased to announce that Mr David Watkins, a retired senior civil servant formerly in the Northern Ireland Office who is well qualified for the task, has agreed to undertake the investigation. His role will be to consider:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>how the original inconsistencies arose, identifying any specific shortcomings in the development and implementation of policy;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>how, subsequently, the departments involved failed to identify that there had been inconsistencies, despite the need to explain the Government&#039;s position in Parliament, in the courts and to the Parliamentary Ombudsman; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>whether there are any lessons to be learnt for the future from such shortcomings as are identified in the development of the scheme and in its administration.

</ul>
<a name="60130-55_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Mr Watkins has begun his investigation and I have indicated my concern that, while it must be thorough, it should be completed as quickly as practicable.

</p>

<a name="60130-55_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>The master plan for the Olympic Park was largely developed in the second half of 2003 by the EDAW consortium and outline planning permissions were secured in autumn 2004. The candidate file submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in November 2004 and subsequently presented to the Evaluation Commission in February 2005 presented the concept of a compact Games with the Olympic Park at its heart.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS6"></a>

<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column WS6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60130-55_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>Since winning the right to stage the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games on 6 July 2005, the master plan has been reviewed, as part of the normal development process for a major project. This review has resulted in changes that will deliver a more compact Olympic Park, while meeting the technical specifications of the IOC. In summary, the revised master plan will:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>free up some land that previously had been required for the Olympic Park;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>avoid the relocation of about 100 businesses, more than 70 homes and a place of worship, and safeguard more than 1200 jobs;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>reduce overall programme and delivery risk;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>enhance operational security, needed after the terrorist attacks on 7 July 2005; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>be delivered with a potential cost reduction over current estimates of between &#163;250 million and &#163;350 million.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60130-55_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>A detailed review has been undertaken of the Olympic village and the core Olympic and Paralympic requirements to improve deliverability, efficiency of design, utilisation, reduce risk and costs and smooth the way for best legacy use.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The revised plan therefore proposes realigning the village to locate approximately 80 per cent of it on the Stratford Rail lands immediately to the north of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL).

</p>

<a name="60130-55_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>The proposed building envelope and mix of uses complies with Stratford City&#039;s existing planning permissions and will provide a village of a similar high standard to that proposed in the original master plan.
</p>

<a name="60130-55_para19"></a>

[HL3521]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60130w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  In 2003&#150;05 the Department for International Development (DfID) spent a total of &#163;79.6 million in Afghanistan bilaterally. The bilateral programme budget for Afghanistan in 2005&#150;06 is &#163;100 million. This has been fully committed and over &#163;75 million has already been disbursed. By the end of 2005&#150;06 DfID will have spent approximately &#163;390 million in Afghanistan bilaterally, since beginning its reconstruction programme in 2000&#150;01 (this includes humanitarian spending).
</p>

<a name="60130w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>In addition to its bilateral programmes in Afghanistan, DfID provides 19 per cent. of the European Commission&#039;s commitment of &#8364;1 billion (2002&#150;07), and 10.4 per cent. of the World Bank&#039;s commitment, currently some $270 million a year. DfID also contributes globally to UN programmes active in Afghanistan, including those of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Food Programme, and through the Asian Development Bank.

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="60130w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The reasons for estimating costs of alcohol misuse, as set out in the Strategy Unit&#039;s background analysis paper <i>Alcohol misuse: How much does it cost?</i> (September 2003) are generic so will still apply.

The strategy on reducing alcohol harm is being taken forward jointly by the Department of Health and the Home Office.

<a name="60130w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The Government&#039;s priority for reducing drink-drive casualties is through effective enforcement, combined with well targeted national publicity campaigns.
</p>

<a name="60130w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>To this end, we have given the police new powers to carry out evidential roadside breathtesting, subject to type approval of appropriate equipment.

<a name="60130w01_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  The design of any body armour system is a trade-off between the physical protection provided by the armour and the increased weight, reduced mobility and agility, and increased heat stress imposed on the user.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>Most of the population are able to make sufficient vitamin D through the action of sunlight on the skin. The Food Standards Agency advises pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people, those of Asian origin, those who always cover up their skin when outside, rarely get outdoors or eat no meat or oily fish to take vitamin D supplements. Some ethnic minority groups, especially if they have pigmented skin and choose diets which exclude meat and fish, may also be vulnerable to low vitamin D status. This may include some individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent.

2. From 2003&#150;04 onwards, the DEL for the Department of Health was increased by a switch from the Exchequers Annually Managed Expenditure spending to cover the increased costs of pensions. An addition of &#163;1.6 billion was made to the NHS DEL to cover these costs from 2003&#150;04 onwards. Whilst this change affected the overall level of NHS Expenditure, they did not increase. or decrease the spending power of the NHS. It is cost neutral.

<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_38"></a>Why, given that the Secretary of State for the Home Department&#039;s plans for police reorganisation stated that any force below 4,000 police officers would be unviable, the option of a stand-alone force for Kent with 3,600 police officers, Hampshire with 3,400 and Devon and Cornwall with 3,000 was put forward as part of the consultation.

<p><a name="wa_st_34"></a>
<a name="60130w04_spmin5"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  Three forces and authorities which are under the 4,000 officer threshold received initial feedback from the Home Office in November 2005 that it might be suitable to stand alone if a compelling case could be made. Any such case would need to show how the forces would ensure that they had the necessary capacity to provide protective services to the appropriate standard.
