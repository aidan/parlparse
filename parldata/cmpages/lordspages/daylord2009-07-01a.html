<ul><a name="09070164000311"></a>

It clearly and accurately describes the duties carried out by the post holder.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="09070164000003"></a><b><a name="90701-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070164000321"></a>Lord Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. Nevertheless, does he not agree that Director of Facilities is a very poor description of the important job which Carl Woodall is doing and that we need something rather more imaginative? If the noble Lord himself lacks inspiration, will he consider asking Members of this House to suggest alternatives and perhaps offer a small prize for the winner?</p>

As I have said, the title describes very well the important job that the new Director of Facilities does. I know that the noble and learned Lord made various suggestions when we debated this the first time around, including Estates Bursar and things like that. But none of his suggestions would as accurately fit the bill as the title we have chosen. I should add that facilities management is now a well recognised profession. That describes exactly what Carl Woodall does.</p>

I am very much in sympathy with the noble and learned Lord asking the Question. If we were in a school, I am sure that we would be happy enough with the title of school caretaker. But this is a palace, so palace bursar has a far better ring about it. Does the noble Lord agree?</p>

The responsibilities for finance are held by the finance director and the accounting officer, the Clerk of the Parliaments, and not the Director of Facilities.</p>

The European Council conclusions say that the decision,</p>
<ul><a name="09070164000288"></a>&#147;gives legal guarantee that certain matters of concern to the Irish people will be unaffected by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070164000259"></a>Those guarantees do not change the Lisbon treaty; the European Council conclusions are very clear on them. The Lisbon treaty, as debated and decided by our Parliament, will not be changed and, on the basis of these guarantees, Ireland will proceed to have a second referendum in October.</p>

Again, I greet her and warmly welcome her to her role as Minister for Europe after her excellent maiden speech last night. I should like to ask her about the guarantees. She says that they are legal, but in fact they have no legal force at the moment. They would have to be incorporated into some future treaty if they are not to be incorporated into the Lisbon treaty. Can she explain how that process is going to work? Which treaty will they be put into and when will this occur? That information would help us a great deal.</p>

Before that protocol can be ratified by the UK, Parliament must pass a Bill. As I said, Parliament will rightly have the final say.</p>

The point is that we have not pushed or pressed or bullied the Irish into this referendum, as some have suggested. They decided that it was a process that they wished to go through. They consulted and are consulting and, as I said, a referendum is to be held in October.</p>

There is nothing in the guarantees that was not debated and discussed by Parliament. The guarantees that we have on taxation, on the rights of defence, in particular, and on the right to life were the key concerns and were discussed by Parliament and by others who have ratified the treaty.</p>

Is not this absolutely and totally a matter for the Irish people, unlike last time when there was huge outside interference from British and other Eurosceptics?

What then is the position of what she calls the binding guarantees if they cannot be turned into protocols? Would she also be good enough to answer the question put by my noble friend Lord Tebbit, who asked whether your Lordships&#146; House and the other place would be able not only to debate these binding arrangements and/or protocols, or whatever they come to be called, but to vote on them?</p>

Does she not agree that it is slightly baffling that such a fuss is being made about this matter when&#151;I think that I am right in saying this, but perhaps she will confirm it&#151;the obligations that this House endorsed in the Lisbon treaty are not being changed by one iota? Also, as every one of the guarantees and clarifications given to the Irish are either neutral for us or beneficial to us by entrenching subsidiarity and by making it clear that the European Union does not have the right to alter company taxation, is it not a little odd that there is not more cheerfulness around?</p>

What he says is true: there is nothing at all contained in the guarantees that we have not seen. As I understand it, noble Lords debated and discussed these issues for 25 days in Parliament, so they will be much more aware than I am of the detail that was gone into.

Officials at the British embassy in Baghdad continue to discuss Camp Ashraf with staff at the US embassy; the most recent discussion took place on 10 June 2009.</p>

I recognise that the Government have no wish to intervene in matters that are the concern of other countries, but given that the Government apparently now subscribe to the culture of &#147;responsibility to protect&#148;, should we not be doing all that we can to avert a potential humanitarian catastrophe? What precisely were the assurances given by the Iraqi Government? Will it be made clear to Mr Maliki that international opinion will hold him accountable for the safety of the citizens of Ashraf?</p>

We particularly sought assurances from the Iraqi Government, who have given them&#151;I now give the assurance that the noble Lord seeks&#151;that no Ashraf residents will be forcibly transferred to a country where they have reason to fear persecution or where substantial grounds exist to believe that they would be tortured. We continue, as the noble Lord rightly says, to have no direct interest or control in this camp, but we continue to liaise with our colleagues in the United States, who are monitoring events with the Iraqi Government.</p>

That ceased to apply in Iraq after 24 June 2004, the date of the end of hostilities and occupation. The United States Government have continued to grant protected persons status as a good-will gesture, but this is not granted through any legal obligation under international law, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has previously determined that Camp Ashraf residents do not qualify as refugees. However, the United Kingdom continues to take an interest to ensure that human rights are protected, as does the United States.</p>

More importantly, is he aware of the intimidation of the inhabitants of Ashraf City? Would it not be right at this time to ensure that the European Union, Britain and America warn Iran that any harm, intimidation or persecution of those inhabitants will result in a reference to the International Criminal Court?</p>

If he has such evidence, I would be pleased to receive it and pass it to authorities which can take the matter further. It is a clear indication of the Government of Iraq&#146;s position that they have given assurances that no Ashraf residents will be forcibly transferred. That suggests that they are honouring their obligations. Our consular staff in Baghdad have talked to people in the camp and assure us that food and medicines are getting through, so there does not seem to be any lack of supply. However, I will happily take on board any evidence that the noble Lord has.</p>

How on earth can it be right for the Iraqi authorities to blockade Ashraf City, refusing people the right to take in food, and demanding police access to the city while asserting that those living there have no rights whatever as citizens? Surely it is time that the British Government talked again to the Iraqi Government and reminded them of their responsibilities under international law.</p>

By shoving this critical Postal Services Bill into cold storage to suit their short-term political ends, despite the Conservative Party still standing ready to help see it on to the statute book, does the Secretary of State not realise that he and his colleagues are putting the trustees of the Royal Mail pension plan in an impossible position given the revaluation that took place on 31 March last?

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09070164000058"></a>We have thoroughly tested the market to see who is interested in partnership, but economic circumstances, I need hardly point out, are extremely difficult. I have always been clear that we would do a deal with the private sector only if it represented value for money for the taxpayer&#151;indeed, I said so at Third Reading on 20 May. Our market testing has shown that now is not the time to sell a minority stake in Royal Mail. The pension remains a matter for the company and the pension trustees. The Government have been clear about the basis on which they would be prepared to take on the pensions deficit. They do not intend to cherry-pick the implementation of the Bill.</p>

Workers and management in the postal services country are living with uncertainty. My first question is: will the Secretary of State urgently get down to talking about the pension fund deficit? My second question is on the regulator. There was almost unanimity around this House about the unbalanced approach of Postcomm. That was clear; it is accepted. Will the Secretary of State now take steps to see that the yoke of Postcomm is removed and move Royal Mail over to a balanced and fair regulator?</p>

Annual payments to pensioners in the plan currently run at around &#163;1 billion. However, government have to be fair to taxpayers. They cannot expect them to take responsibility for the deficit if the other challenges facing Royal Mail are not also addressed. As I said, it would be irresponsible for the Government to cherry-pick implementation of the Bill. It would be irresponsible in respect of the taxpayer and impossible in respect of the European Commission, which would have to give state aid approval. As for the regulator, Postcomm will continue to regulate the postal market for the time being. It will not do so in a vacuum. Its powers will remain the same, but it will have to take full account of developments in the postal market, where volumes are falling at unprecedented levels.</p>

This morning, National Express Group announced that it will not provide the further financial support necessary to ensure that its subsidiary, National Express East Coast, remains solvent. As a consequence, National Express East Coast is no longer able to continue operations to the full term of its franchise, and expects to become insolvent later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09070164000068"></a>The decision of National Express to break its contract is regrettable and disappointing. All other rail companies are fulfilling their contracts, despite the economic downturn. It is simply unacceptable to reap the benefits of contracts when times are good, only to walk away from them when times become more challenging.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09070164000069"></a>My first and overriding obligation in this situation is to ensure continuity of service to passengers, with no disruption or diminution of service standards. When the Government have had to step in to protect rail services in the past, there has been no such impact on passengers. I have therefore established a publicly owned company, which will take over this franchise from the point at which National Express East Coast ceases to operate.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_226"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90701-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09070164000070"></a>We will agree an orderly handover with National Express. Until that date, National Express will operate services on the current basis. After that date, the new public company will do so. There will be no interruption of services. Existing operational staff&#151;who continue to provide a good service&#151;will transfer to the new east coast main line company, so will the assets necessary for the continuation of the service. I can assure the travelling public that services will continue without disruption and all tickets will be honoured. I have today appointed Elaine Holt, until recently managing director of First Capital Connect, a major train operating company, as chief executive designate of the new east coast main line company.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09070164000071"></a>The failure of National Express East Coast obviously entails the loss of some future premium payments to which the company was contractually committed. However, while the franchise is under public control, the Government will receive the full revenues of a business which continues to make an operating profit. We will also gain the benefit of any premium payments from the new franchise once it is re-let. This represents a far better deal for the taxpayer than the only alternative course of action, which was to renegotiate the franchise in an exclusive manner with National Express, with no recourse to what is a highly competitive market for rail franchises. The cost of re-letting the franchise will be met from the performance bond of &#163;32 million, to which the company is contractually bound in the event of termination.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09070164000072"></a>National Express also operates rail services on the East Anglia main line and associated commuter routes. The company has said that it does not intend to default on its obligations in respect of these franchises. Notwithstanding that, the Government believe they may have grounds to terminate these franchises, and we are exploring all options in the light of the group&#146;s statement this morning. In the mean time, we expect National Express to meet its obligations on these franchises in full.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09070164000073"></a>The department&#146;s procurement procedures test a company&#146;s track record and their ability to deliver a franchise and to demonstrate value for money in so doing. It would clearly be reasonable not to invite a company to bid for future franchises in circumstances where it had recently failed to deliver on a previous franchise. A company which had defaulted in the way National Express now intends would not have pre-qualified for any previous franchises let by the department. I note that the parent groups of previous franchise failures are no longer in the UK rail business.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09070164000074"></a>The Government intend to tender for a new east coast franchise operator from the end of 2010. The specification of the new franchise will reflect my concern to secure better passenger services and facilities. In particular, I will be seeking to secure significant further improvements to service quality, including to station security, bike and car parking facilities at stations, bus interchange facilities and train catering. This will ensure a step-change improvement for passengers from a new east coast franchise. I intend to consult fully on the new franchise specification, including with passenger groups, parliamentarians and the Scottish Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09070164000075"></a>I have explained the action I have taken to ensure that passengers are not affected by the decision of National Express Group, and the consequences for that group of their decision.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09070164000076"></a>Let me also put these events in a wider context. No other train operator has defaulted on its franchise or indicated to us any intention to do so. Nor has any other company sought to renegotiate its franchise. Today&#146;s events do not represent the failure of the system, but the failure of one company. The rail franchising system was examined by the National Audit Office last year. It was found to deliver good value for money. The National Audit Office also concluded, and I quote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09070164000271"></a>&#147;The Department&#146;s arrangements for identifying and managing risks, including handling the failure of a train operator, are well planned and follow good practice&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000260"></a>We are following that good practice in today&#146;s announcement, and I would welcome a further examination by the National Audit Office once the franchise is re-let.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09070164000077"></a>In respect of rail services at large, they are steadily improving. Passenger numbers are at their highest levels since the 1940s, punctuality is over 90 per cent and overall passenger satisfaction is rising, as shown in the latest independent <I>National Passenger Survey</I>, published yesterday. Moreover, the revenue from rail franchising is enabling us to make record investments in upgrading the network and services on it.</p>

<a name="90701-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09070164000078"></a>We saw this as recently as last month in the award of the new South Central franchise for services on lines through south London, Surrey and Sussex. This was conducted during the recession yet yielded a winning franchise bidder&#151;the existing operator&#151;committed to paying a premium of &#163;534 million to the taxpayer over nearly six years, in place of the previous contract under which the operator was subsidised by the taxpayer. This bodes well for future franchise awards, including for services on the east coast main line.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90701-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90701-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09070164000080"></a>During the Secretary of State's interview with Adam Shaw on the &#147;Today&#148; programme today, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09070164000272"></a>&#147;We have tried-and-tested procedures in place for taking over train operations when existing operators are unable to meet their commitments&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000261"></a>He certainly does. In 2006 the east coast franchise was then known as GNER and it failed in far more favourable economic circumstances. The Government appear to have learnt nothing from the collapse of GNER and have continued to press train operators to make wildly optimistic bids. However, I accept that no one in 2007 expected to see such a big reduction in GDP.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09070164000081"></a>In the same programme, the Secretary of State said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09070164000273"></a>&#147;What we are dealing with here is a set of financial problems in the owning group, National Express, which have led to the departure of the Chief Executive today&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000262"></a>However, is it not the case that the franchise agreement and the bid were based on a fixed and capped amount of parental support from National Express of about &#163;70 million? If the DfT wanted more parental support  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_228"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then could it not have asked for it in the relevant tender documents? But, of course, any increase in parental support obligations would be reflected in a lower premium bid for the franchise. This is a profitable franchise route, so the operator generally pays the DfT for the right to run it.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09070164000082"></a>There has been much use of the word &#147;default&#148;. What precisely is the default? What is its nature? NXEC has stated that it will run out of parental support provided in the franchise sometime later this year unless the economy picks up to an extraordinary extent. Has the Secretary of State detected any failure of operating performance by NXEC, the actual franchise, not National Express? Is NXEC meeting all its contractual obligations, and what part of the contract has been broken by National Express at this point?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09070164000083"></a>The key point is that taxpayers and rail users around the country will want to know whether Ministers appreciated when the DfT let this franchise that the operator's liability was capped; and is this desirable or not?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09070164000084"></a>I note that all tickets, including season tickets, will be honoured. That is extremely welcome, and the passengers have no need to worry on that score.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09070164000085"></a>In a previous exchange, the Secretary of State told us that there were cross-default provisions in the franchise agreements with National Express. But is it not the case that they only apply when the default on one franchise will have a material impact on other franchises within that group, and is there any evidence of this?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09070164000086"></a>In his Statement, the Secretary of State said that no other company has sought to renegotiate its franchise. What are the negotiations with Brian Souter and Stagecoach about?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09070164000087"></a>My final question is this. Does the Secretary of State really expect to be able to let a franchise on this route with another operator but at substantially the same terms as those obtained in 2007 when the economy was so very different?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09070164000088"></a>This is a very difficult problem for the Secretary of State to solve. He is in a Catch-22 situation. The fact of the matter is that less money is coming into the rail industry and he will have to work out what to do about it. If he renegotiates&#151;which he does not want to do&#151;he will open the floodgates; if he does not, he will face extra costs and loss of morale among the operating staff on the east coast line.</p>

I should chasten him on one or two points. The National Audit Office, from which he drew comfort, in its report on the franchising process ticked the boxes and said that the procedures had been followed. However, when I raised the policy issues behind the franchising process with the NAO, it said that policy issues were not a matter for it. What you have is an auditor&#146;s report with a lot of ticks in boxes; you do not have a fundamental review.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09070164000090"></a>Secondly, the south central franchise has new rolling stock, more rolling stock on order and is in a part of the country which is less affected by the recession. I am not surprised that there were reasonable bids for  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_229"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that franchise. However, it is time that we paused for reflection on the franchising service. This is not another Northern Rock situation whereby we will get the franchise back into the private sector and get some money in as quickly as we can. Nor is it a job licence for officials who now have no franchises to let, so they can spend a couple of years playing around with this one.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09070164000091"></a>Also, I take issue with the idea that there is the prospect of a highly competitive market. It will not be a highly competitive market. National Express&#146;s debt is &#163;1.5 billion; First Group, which has been talking about bidding for the franchise, has a debt of &#163;2.5 billion. Do we really want to let franchises to people who are basically without money behind them?</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09070164000092"></a>For half the money that we invested in privatisation, we could have had the best railway in Europe. What we have is much more expensive compared with British Rail. I suggest that the Minister draws some professional experienced railwaymen into a debate about the future of the franchising process. I congratulate him on obtaining the services of Elaine Holt as chief executive and I can assure him that I can give him the names of a few more people who would do a damn sight better job than is being done now.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09070164000093"></a>I am sure that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition as well as supporters of the Government would join in such a review. They must by now acknowledge the fact that privatisation was a tremendous mistake based on running down the railways. The focus, however, must be on what the passenger wants. I suggest that he wants clean trains with clean lavatories, sufficient accommodation and proper catering. These are very simple things which are often provided by very few well trained, low-paid extra staff&#151;probably not the sort of people who are employed by lawyers, merchant bankers and consultants.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09070164000094"></a>What we need is a cheaper, less confrontational railway. The franchising system is not fit for purpose and a review is necessary. Network Rail has just appointed a new chairman and is reviewing the structure of that company. What could be a better time than to review the future of franchising at the same time and take out of the railway a lot of the internal and expensive disputes with which it is plagued?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09070164000098"></a>The noble Lord asked me to reflect on the lessons of this experience, and I intend to do that. As the great Mr Gladstone said at the age of 82 as he was forming his fourth Administration, &#147;I have been a learner all my life&#148;. At my very young age, I am certainly a learner. It is very important that we continue to learn from the experience of events such as the collapse of the National Express east coast franchise, and I will be learning. I am also very mindful of the noble Lord&#146;s point about seeing that we get a better contract specification. That is precisely why I do not intend to rush into re-letting the franchise. I could have simply re-let the existing franchise in a much shorter period than from now to September 2010, as indicated in my Statement. The reason why I want to take longer is to reflect on the experience, as the noble Lord recommended, and to improve the contract specification.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09070164000099"></a>I entirely share the noble Lord&#146;s concern to see that many of the nuts and bolts issues are addressed. I refer to better facilities at stations and better services on trains. I also know that among your Lordships the issue of catering on the east coast main line has been&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;a live issue over many months, and I intend to see that we have proper contract specifications in respect of catering. In addition, as part of my campaign to see that stations are much more amenable to cyclists, I want a great deal more bicycle parking at stations. I believe that this could be a very big growth market for the railways in the future. Therefore, I will be reflecting; I will not be rushing into a new franchise; and I hope that the next franchise that we let will be better than the previous one.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09070164000100"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, made a number of points with which I agree. I think that for the future we need to reflect further on the relationship between parent groups and special purpose vehicles. However, his fundamental point, which I know his party has been making during the day, is that the system is fundamentally broken. Perhaps I may say in parenthesis that this is a system that his party began. It involves the private sector, which I thought was a great cause of the Conservative Party, and it involves people bidding in market conditions for franchises. Therefore, I think that the noble Earl and his party need to be quite careful before they seek what many of my noble friends would like, which is to move back much more dramatically in favour of a publicly controlled and managed railway. I have sought, as I do on many of these issues, to see that we get the best of the private sector but ensure that it is properly regulated, as it must be when serving the public interest.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09070164000101"></a>I must address the suggestion which has been put out during the morning and which I regard as comical: that Ministers and my predecessors&#151;presumably the noble Earl means predecessors on his side of the House too&#151;press train operators to make, in his words, &#147;wildly optimistic bids&#148;. He had the grace to concede that GDP had fallen significantly since. We are talking about people such as Brian Souter and Sir Moir Lockhead. Does he believe that they would respond to suggestions from me that they should raise their bids a bit and put aside their own commercial interests? I have never met anyone with a sharper sense of his own commercial interest than Brian Souter, and I respect him for that. That is why he is such a  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_231"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>successful businessman and why he runs such a successful business. I know that there have been contractual issues, to which the noble Earl referred, in respect of South West Trains, but let us be clear why there are such issues. It is because Brian Souter knows exactly what his own commercial interest is, and of course he pursues it as relentlessly and as vigorously as he can. My job is to pursue the public interest as relentlessly and as vigorously as I can, and I hope that the House can rely on me to do that.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09070164000102"></a>This contract, which the noble Earl says was wildly optimistic in its bidding, was bid for by Richard Bowker, who was then the chief executive of National Express. Richard Bowker is a former chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, so the idea that we had some ing&#233;nue who did not understand the rail market and was responding to a Minister of the day who was pressing him to bid higher than he wished to do comes from fantasy-land and does not help us through this issue at all. The reality is that we had 16 rail franchises and only one of them is in financial difficulty. None of the other operating groups has indicated to me either any intention to default or any likelihood of defaulting. Let us be clear that National Express will pay a financial penalty for leaving the franchise in the way in which it has indicated, and we will ensure that it meets its contractual commitments in full. National Express will pay a massive penalty in reputation for breaching its contracts with the Government.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09070164000103"></a>I said that we had previous experience, which I shall put in context. Since the process of rail franchising started, we have let a large number of contracts&#151;41 to be precise. Of those 41, only two have failed until now. The franchise that we are discussing today might well fail, but of the two that have, neither of the owning groups responsible is now in the UK rail business. That is a sobering lesson to any other operator, including National Express, that chooses to go down the same path. It is a massive penalty.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09070164000104"></a>I shall end my remarks by referring to the National Audit Office. I am always guided by a proper and thorough analysis of public policy in the decisions that I take. The NAO, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, indicated, carried out a thorough review of the franchising system. I do not think that it is fair to say that it simply looked at procedural issues. It looked at substantive issues, and reached substantive judgments. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09070164000274"></a>&#147;The Department&#146;s approach to rail franchising produces generally well thought through service specifications and generates keen bidding competition. This approach has resulted in better value for money for the taxpayer on the eight franchises let since the Department took over from the SRA&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000263"></a>It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09070164000275"></a>&#147;The Department&#146;s arrangements for identifying and managing risks, including handling the failure of a train operator, are well planned and follow good practice&#148;.</p>

<a name="90701-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09070164000105"></a>I fully accept my public responsibilities to see that the train service is not interrupted and that we learn the lessons from previous experience in re-letting the franchise, but I do not accept that the fundamental policy is flawed. Never in the past 50 years have railways been in a better state in this country than they are today. They have an optimistic future. I am an optimist and I believe that we could construct the best railway system in Europe. We just have to have a mind to do so.</p>

I feel very strongly as I have known many of the employees quite well for the past 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09070164000107"></a>Secondly, how confident in reality is the Minister about re-letting the franchise? I have serious worries and doubts. Thirdly and finally, does he have any idea about, or will he look into what plans there might be, for those of us who have loyalty programmes with National Express? I have a serious amount of credits, and should be interested to know what will happen to them in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09070164000109"></a>On pensions, I undertake that the terms and conditions of staff working for National Express East Coast will be fully protected as it transfers into the new public company. The staff will not lose out by the transfer. On the question of re-letting, as I said in my Statement, we have recently re-let an important contract&#151;the South Central contract&#151;for services from south London, Sussex and Surrey into central London. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said that this was somehow a special case. In fact, the range of bids for that contract was very wide indeed. As a result, we have moved from a franchise that was being subsidised by the taxpayer to a franchise operator agreeing to pay &#163;534 million to the Government over five years and 10 months. It is not a new, fly-by-night merchant, but a solid, reliable and well established operator. Recent experience of rail franchising has been positive and gives us comfort for believing that we can have competition for the east coast main line, which is highly prestigious, and that we can get good value for the taxpayer. Experience of what happened to GNER after Sea Containers withdrew, and what happened with Connex, the south-eastern train operator, which could not continue in the rail business, shows that we had keen competition for the franchise thereafter.</p>

In respect of prior warning, it is fair to say that National Express had made its concerns about the viability of its east coast operation clear to us over a number of months, but it was only in the immediate run-up to today and the trading statement that the company felt that it had to make on its half-year results that it told us firmly that it intended later in the year to default on its franchise commitments. By the way, the noble Earl asked me: what is the default? The default will be a failure to pay the premium payments to which the company is committed.</p>

I particularly welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s comment that he will do his best to make sure that there is smooth running of the service.

I hope that we do not rush it too much. I am still worried about the timescale the Secretary of State is talking about. I have raised with him the fact that in recent months there has been a lot of discussion in the press about the franchise. One of the things I picked up was the increase in passengers that National Express thought it would get to give it the money to pay the Government. When I looked at it, I had no idea where it would have put those passengers because the trains that we travel on are very crowded and there was no indication, in the short term anyway, that we were going to get new rolling stock. When the Government look at the franchise, will they please look at the passenger predictions because many of the trains, even now in the downturn, are very full? Putting 50 per cent more people on the present trains is impossible.</p>

Would he support efforts to re-establish that link to Heathrow? Would the Minister also agree with the view of many of us that the heyday of the north-east railway service was the Great North Eastern Railway company operating a franchise very successfully for 11 years from 1996 under the previous Conservative Government?</p>

It is not correct to say that there was simply one operator that was way out ahead of the others, with them far behind. GNER was very anxious indeed to retain the franchise and bid hard to do so. Because, as the noble Lord so rightly says, of the excellent train service to the north-east and the view that operators had that it is possible to grow that market significantly, the market conditions of the time and growth projections have been attractive to many operators.</p>

We all remember Jimmy Savile declaring in the 1970s that this was the age of the train, but, frankly, nobody really believed him at the time because the reality and the hype were so much at variance. However, rail services have improved dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years. Objectively, it is true that the public have more confidence in the railways because so many more members of the public are using them than was the case even a few years ago. My noble friend&#146;s remarks about the increased volume of trains are absolutely right too. The number of services running on the network is now higher than at any time since Beeching, so we have indeed improved not only the quality of services but the volume of services too, alongside increases in passenger numbers.

Before I discuss the detail of the amendment, I wish to mention a few points about our general approach to Part 2 and what we are trying to achieve with these amendments.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09070164000141"></a>The Government stated that their main aim in this part is to try to reform the law in this area to make it much more difficult to exploit trafficked women and much easier to catch the traffickers. However, we have worries that this part as drafted makes life much less safe for women sex workers, still allows child victims to be treated as criminals and puts clients in a position of automatic guilt. When we debated similar clauses under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 before the Government withdrew them, I urged the Government to assess New Zealand&#146;s approach of decriminalising prostitution. I am extremely dismayed that the Government have not examined that example in any detail, especially as the five-year evaluation of it shows so many positive outcomes. I feel that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have turned their back on that example and I would like to ask the Minister the reason for that.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09070164000142"></a>This part of the Bill could simply be seen as a moral crusade against sex workers and their clients. People have had these moral crusades for hundreds or even thousands of years. Meanwhile, the issues of the health of society and real routes out of prostitution for women who want that option remain unaddressed. We have amendments to address those issues. There have been those who claim that the Bill is a great move forward to stop women being treated as sex objects and to help rehabilitate prostitutes. Sadly, that is the view of some so-called feminists. I say &#147;sadly&#148; because normally I would be pleased to call myself a feminist, but in this case I believe that the approach is naive and takes no account of reality. It dangerously makes some women&#146;s lives less safe and more difficult.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09070164000143"></a>With those few opening remarks, I will turn to our first amendments, which would replace subsections (1) and (2) of new Section 53A of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and Article 64A of the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. Government Amendments 55 and 64 will be consequential on our amendments. The effect would be to remove the strict liability offence for clients. We will come on to debate strict liability later under the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, so I will not go into the detail of that yet.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09070164000144"></a>This amendment&#151;whether we should have this clause at all is a question to which we will come later&#151;would ensure that the definitions used are useful and accurate, and address what has made the woman behave against her will. I agree that the Government have clearly had doubts about their original drafting. Many doubts were expressed in the Commons, particularly by my noble friend Evan Harris who campaigned very hard on this issue. I am pleased that the Government have tabled their own amendments to this clause, which attempts to move in some direction on definition.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09070164000145"></a>I believe that our amendment is stronger. It changes the definition of the offence from one where a person has used force, deception or threats in the expectation of gain for themselves in order to induce or encourage a person to provide sexual services, and replaces it with an offence that stipulates that a prostitute must have been coerced, which it defines, does not freely consent or has been subject to the internationally recognised Palermo definition of trafficking.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09070164000146"></a>We believe that getting the drafting right at this stage is critical. If this Bill is to serve any purpose in stopping trafficking, those definitions and their use in court will be extremely important. We are anxious to have something that is of use for when traffickers are being prosecuted and, if this clause is included, a considerably tightened up definition. I beg to move.</p>

Given that, I shall leave my remarks on strict liability and the precise definition of exploitative behaviour covered by the government amendment, along with the level of offences, until we reach the relevant groups.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09070164000149"></a>I shall concentrate instead on whether a new offence of paying for the sexual services of a prostitute subjected to force adds anything to the Government&#146;s wider policy of reducing human trafficking and prosecuting those who engage in it. None of us would disagree that the trafficking of human beings is a grievous crime and that the Government need to do everything they can to ensure that the enforcement agencies engaged in tracking and prosecuting those who promote it can do so expeditiously, and that they do then take action, particularly when they believe or have reason to believe that people are being forced into prostitution as a result. We know that the figures for those being forced into prostitution are ridiculously high.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09070164000150"></a>It is appalling that the United Kingdom remains classified by the United Nations as a high-level destination country for trafficking and that women and children are still being lured here, often under false pretences, in the belief that they are coming to do worthwhile work, but are ending up being exploited. Despite endless legislation to deal with the matter&#151;we had the Serious Crime Bill just recently&#151;only a small number of prosecutions takes place. It is also unfortunate that when faced with evidence that human trafficking is still growing, all the Government can do is to add an offence that would result in a level 3 fine.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09070164000151"></a>We have been calling for a wholesale review of the legislation surrounding prostitution and the various associated offences, particularly that of trafficking, because there is a great deal of it. However, this Bill does not review it. Sadly, it represents yet another missed opportunity. Neither this offence nor the various other tweaks and adjustments in the clause will do anything much to help those trapped in prostitution to find a way out or to bring those profiting from it to justice. A wealth of offences dealing with trafficking and exploitative prostitution is already on the statute book, so the Government must look hard at the reasons why these offences are not working. The statistics on the number of women and children trafficked into this country provide damning evidence that not only have this Government lost control of immigration, but that much more must be done to catch traffickers and their victims at our borders. The prosecution figures are also extremely disheartening. Despite the thousands estimated to be trafficked for sexual exploitation, the number of convictions has never risen above 40 a year, and with the exception of a few notable cases, sentences have been far lower than the legislation allows for.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09070164000152"></a>The challenges of bringing a case to a successful prosecution are considerable, and the international element often imposes long, frustrating delays and raises the costs. The offences we have in place are pretty clear, but the nature of the crime makes it hard for victims to come forward. This is important because they are isolated from the enforcement agencies not only as a result of their fear of reprisals from those who are pimping them, but because of their fear of  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_241"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prosecution or deportation. We do not oppose this new offence as such because those providing human traffickers with a lucrative market must bear their share of responsibility for the suffering that is caused. However, like the noble Baroness, I have strong reservations about whether the offence as drafted will make the difference the Government appear to be hoping for. Indeed, there is a danger that it will do the exact opposite of what is intended.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09070164000153"></a>The debates in another place suggest that the Government are hoping that by focusing on the demand side of the equation, more can be done to reduce the industry than is currently possible by attacking the supply. I am extremely sceptical of this assumption. For one thing, those who are trafficking these often young and extremely vulnerable women are perpetrating one of the worst crimes prevalent in our society, and I hope that this new offence does not in any way indicate that the Government have given up trying to catch and successfully prosecute the traffickers.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09070164000154"></a>With scarce resources, enforcement of any new offence runs the risk of diverting attention away from the investigation of existing offences. As it is impossible that the new offence could be committed without the existence of the person referred to as person C in the legislation, I hope the Minister can assure me that it would, if agreed, be used only in conjunction with police efforts to track down, arrest and imprison the traffickers.</p>

<a name="90701-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09070164000155"></a>I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. As I say, we will come to the question of strict liability on my next amendment.</p>

Obviously, prostitution has gone on for ever and ever. Herodotus talks about the temples of Babylon and there is a wonderful quote from Gibbon, which I shall not repeat because it might be regarded as offensive to those of the Roman Catholic faith; it refers to the activities of a rather early mediaeval Pope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09070164000157"></a>In the JCHR report on the Bill, we state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09070164000282"></a>&#147;We welcome any initiative aimed at protecting the rights of those who are trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, or who are otherwise engaged in sex work without their consent... However, we question whether the precise methods chosen by the Government meet its positive human rights obligations and we are concerned that they run the real risk of making those engaged in prostitution even more vulnerable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000265"></a>In the human trafficking report we produced in 2005-06, we say of human trafficking that it is,</p>

<p><a name="09070164000266"></a>Therefore, above all, we have got to catch those who are indulging in it. That means, surely, that we have to be as tolerant as we possibly can be towards the women who are exploited by making sure that their life is made easy and that they can report it to the police without fear. The proposed new clause will make it easier for a client who may come to suspect that a woman is trafficked to go to the police.</p>

The mechanics of exploitation seem to be more advanced than they were in the days of that Maltese gang, the name of which I cannot remember, in the 1950s, whose members were successfully prosecuted, convicted and sent to prison for very long terms. We need the ability for that to happen now because, as my noble friend said, this country is one of the most lucrative markets for trafficking.

During my time on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, when we were taking evidence on these issues, I do not think that any of us, irrespective of party, was anything but deeply disturbed and moved by what we heard. The evidence came from dedicated voluntary organisations and others working with the victims and from some of the police who were specialising in this area. One of the things that impressed me was how deep the concern of the police carrying this responsibility became about the nature of the situation with which they were dealing and the women involved.</p>

If they are dealing with victims of a cruel trade, it is essential to concentrate on trying to deal with the wicked criminals who conduct it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09070164000162"></a>I want to say one more thing about the issues raised by the amendment. I am afraid&#151;I use that word advisedly&#151;that there is a big educational task to be undertaken in this country. It is important that as many people as possible understand what is really happening, and what the implications are of the services being provided. It is nothing but helpful, therefore, to have in the Bill as much explicit information as possible about what trafficking and coercion really mean, to enable the public to understand their responsibilities if they decide to indulge in prostitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09070164000165"></a>I have doubts about the effectiveness of both the Government&#146;s clause and the variety of amendments that have been put forward. If there are to be amendments, I choose to support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but I say that there are doubts because there could be important unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09070164000166"></a>If the Committee will bear with me, I will tell the story of a Czech girl trained by her mother to be a masseuse, a girl of the utmost propriety who was brought here in the belief that she was going to a genuine massage parlour&#151;not the sort of parlour that we in England would understand it to be. She found herself in a brothel in Totnes in Devon. She was there for a week, a girl with no experience, and I believe that there were 12 men on the first night. One has just to think what that must have been like for an inexperienced, decent girl. On the fifth, seventh or eighth day she was taken to the local pub, where she very bravely made a huge scene. The police were called, and they looked after her. She was returned to her home in the Czech Republic and to her perfectly respectable mother.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09070164000167"></a>The police take time to get evidence internationally. The way in which the questions are asked is a nightmare for the CPS and for anyone engaged in these trials; it takes months, sometimes years, for the evidence to be available to prosecute. So what did the police do? In this case, they prosecuted these people as brothel-keepers and got them convicted. Why? Because some of the men whom this girl serviced, or who were good enough not to make her do that, were so shocked by her story that they came forward and gave evidence against the brothel-keepers, who are now serving sentences of imprisonment. Would they do that if they were to become part of the criminal population for having had sex with someone who they knew, or ought to have known, had been trafficked? That is a really quite dangerous unintended consequence. If this clause goes through, amended or unamended, something will have to be done to protect those men prepared to come forward to help trafficked girls and to catch brothel-keepers. I am glad to say that the police are now going to prosecute them as traffickers, but that will be a long-drawn-out prosecution. However, I offer this example to the House as a problem about criminalising those who pay for sex.</p>

Clause 13 has attracted great criticism, which is hardly surprising. On the face of it, it seems strange that paying for sex may or may not be criminal, depending on circumstances which cannot be known to the payer. In reality, it would be quite impossible for the would-be payer&#151;the customer&#151;to ascertain whether a third person has used force, deception or threats to encourage the woman to provide sexual services. Having said that, I am not greatly attracted by Amendment 45. Surely it would be almost impossible for the prosecution to prove both that the woman had been trafficked and that the man knew, or ought to have known, that the woman had been trafficked or that her sexual services had been provided through coercion, still less that the woman was doing what she was doing in order to gain access to drugs. Not to put too fine a point on it, in my view there is not the slightest doubt that the amendment would render Clause 13 completely useless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09070164000169"></a>I find it difficult to see how men could complain if it was simply made an offence to pay for the services of a prostitute. Some prostitution would be forced off the streets while the girls continued to work in brothels, but surely it is likely that with the threat of prosecution hanging over those seeking the services of prostitutes, demand for the services of prostitutes would fall overall, and that would mean fewer people being forced into prostitution. It could cause hardship to women down on their luck who, under no pressure from any particular person, want to offer their services, but the Government&#146;s proposal, through its deterrent effect, would also hit such women.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09070164000170"></a>A complete ban on paying prostitutes for sex might save some women from themselves. After all, there is little doubt that even those not forced into prostitution tend, once in that way of life, to fall into the hands of evil people. They are often then the victims of rape; they suffer physical violence from customers and from those who have set themselves up as their protectors; and a very high proportion turn to drugs to help face the hazards of a life in which they have become trapped.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09070164000171"></a>It seems obvious that if in this country demand for the services of prostitutes was reduced, there would also be a reduction in the number of women being brought from abroad to work in British brothels. Surveys suggest that a total of about 80,000 prostitutes may be working in Britain, of whom perhaps a quarter have come here as a result of the activities of traffickers. So it surely follows that a reduction in demand will help to reduce human misery.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09070164000172"></a>Finally, it is sometimes said that the best way to proceed is to have official regulation of prostitution, it being asserted that if the trade were properly regulated women would be better protected. But the experience of the Netherlands and Australia suggests that it would be impossible to make regulations 100 per cent effective and we would finish up with a regulated market alongside an unregulated market.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09070164000173"></a>However, all this is pretty academic. Regulation is no more on offer today than is a complete ban. What is on offer is Clause 13. Since I feel that we have to try to do something, I am tempted to vote with the Government in spite of the obvious and justified criticisms of the clause and the justified fear that to create such a strict liability offence might be an unfortunate precedent. However, I am anxious to hear what other noble Lords have to say on the matter.</p>

The clause implies that almost everyone supplying sexual services is somehow forced into it by the traffickers. It is essential to understand that there are women who provide sexual services either voluntarily, because of various circumstances which I do not have time to go into, or because they are trafficked. If you confuse the two and reduce demand, you are as likely to drive away the women who are voluntarily there and you will not do much to reduce trafficking. All that will happen if the price falls is that more ruthless and efficient suppliers will drive away the voluntary, one-person or two-person providers. You might therefore be just as likely to strengthen the traffickers. These sorts of perverse effects&#151;or unintended consequences, as the noble Baroness pointed to in another context&#151;are well known in economics.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09070164000176"></a>We should therefore be careful in believing that just because we cut demand for a service, we necessarily get rid of its supply, especially that part of the supply which is more odious. The amendment of the noble Baroness is an attempt to discriminate between those women who provide sexual services voluntarily and those who have been forced into it. It is a difficult distinction, but we should make some attempt to make it, otherwise we shall punish the women who do not deserve to be punished as having been trafficked.</p>

However, I do not think that those who, like me, start out by supporting the Government do so primarily out of a sense of moral crusade, although moral issues are raised even where money is paid for sex where there is consent on both sides. Where the law intrudes into moral issues of this kind is always a difficult issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09070164000178"></a>However, in the background is the inexorable growth in prostitution in our country, for which the figures are alarming. Also in the background is the increased sexualisation of our culture and of children in particular at an ever younger age. The difficulty with that is not only that children are involved but that the sexualisation of our culture is very much in male terms. At the end of the day, it is very much a male view of prostitution that tends to be in the frame, in the background. There are figures for sexually transmitted diseases, for births to teenage mothers, on the level of abortion and so on. That is a difficult background, and it is understandable that the Government want to bear down on a particular aspect of prostitution, which has grown in an alarming way. As I understand it, about 80 per cent of active prostitutes in London come from abroad; not all of them are trafficked, of course, but a significant proportion are. We heard a horrific story about that from the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss&#151;and we think of the absolute trauma involved.</p>

I suspect that there will be other aspects of this that will have to come back to this House in future. This Bill deals with a particular aspect&#151;the issue of trafficking&#151;because there has been a growth in that crime, and a growth in the number of young women has been instanced to us. If we are to change the law in this area, it must be kept as simple as possible, and we should not allow too many other issues to come in. Therefore, I am slightly concerned with Amendment 45, partly because of the link made with drug-taking. I am told that 95 per cent of street prostitutes do what they do to fund a drug habit, so in one sense anyone engaging a prostitute for money should know that there is likely to be a link with drugs. However, that is a separate issue from the one that the Government want to bring forth.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09070164000180"></a>I say that this matter should be as simple as possible&#151;and that will be the issue to discuss in the next set of debates on strict liability&#151;so I shall not say any more now, other than that there are real issues of the protection of women in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09070164000184"></a>As I understand it, the Bill creates a new offence if a client visits a prostitute whom he knows, or should know, has been trafficked or otherwise forced into prostitution, even if in fact he may not know of her circumstances. The question is very simple: if the police are sufficiently aware of the prostitute&#146;s circumstances to arrest the client, why do they not instead arrest the traffickers or the people who have forced the girl into prostitution? Surely the police have to say to the client that they know the unfortunate girl&#146;s circumstances well enough to arrest him and that he must also know them, or he should. If the police are not in possession of the necessary facts, how can they successfully prosecute

I am very glad that, despite the number of noble Lords who have spoken and the amount of wisdom that has been expressed, there are one or two things left that I might say. A number of noble Lords who spoke at Second Reading made the point that social problems are rarely solved by law enforcement measures and that when they are it is usually only for the short term.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09070164000187"></a>I will speak generally to the relevant clauses in the Bill before I come to the specific amendment to which my name is attached. Law enforcement in this case could leave the social evil untouched and make the situation worse. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Desai, who explained much better than I could have done, the basic economics of a market and how it will not respond in the way that it is expected to by people passing laws.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09070164000188"></a>There is absolutely no doubt, as noble Lords have said, that many social evils are associated with prostitution, such as exploitation, trafficking, untreated health conditions, violence, the danger of assault and murder as well as the degradation of neighbourhoods by bringing in activities that are extremely unpleasant for those who have to live there. I am sure that all those who live in such neighbourhoods would like a successful solution to those problems and that all those who work in the sex industry would like to be protected from the violence and the dangers to their health.</p>

<a name="90701-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09070164000189"></a>When confronted with this range of issues, from human trafficking to problems in neighbourhoods to serious health and violence problems, one must ask how the Government came up with the big idea of reducing demand for prostitution through the criminal law. The Government&#146;s paper <I>Tackling the Demand for Prostitution</I> said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09070164000283"></a>&#147;So far ... little attention has been focused on the sex buyer, the person responsible for creating the demand for prostitution markets. And it is time for that to change&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000267"></a>Can the Minister shed some light on why it is now time for that to change? What else was tried before it was decided that the best way of dealing with the undoubted problems was to try to tackle demand? Is there evidence, apart from the disputed information from Sweden? Are the Government convinced that they will not make the lives of many of these vulnerable people more risky and more miserable?</p>

I also support very much the approach taken by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and her remarks on the need for a much more thoughtful and scientifically based approach to two issues&#151;one is human trafficking and the other is street prostitution; the two things are not the same&#151;and an approach that can rescue those who have been trafficked while also protecting those who face the dangers of street sex work.</p>

It is clear listening to this debate that these are very difficult issues. I wonder whether he can clarify the intent behind subsection (2)(b) of new Section 53A. This provision states that it is irrelevant,</p>
<ul><a name="09070164000292"></a>&#147;whether A is, or ought to be, aware that C has used force, deception or threats&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070164000192"></a>It seems to me that the way in which that is drafted is tantamount to saying that A, in procuring the services of a prostitute, is in almost all circumstances facing the threat of prosecution. In other words it is tantamount to making the procurement of a prostitute an illegal act, because unless anyone who does so is absolutely certain of the opposite, they face the threat of prosecution. I therefore ask the Minister to clarify whether the purpose of the clause as drafted is in effect to make prostitution in normal circumstances illegal. Or is there some other purpose or intent behind the way in which the clause has been drafted?</p>

I was among those who on previous occasions expressed the view taken by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner&#151;who is now rather prohibited from making any comments on this subject in view of his appointment, on which we all congratulate him. The issue that should be concentrated on more than any other is that the trafficking should be stopped much earlier, at the borders, as we have discussed in relation to other Bills. It should even be stopped on the other side, in the country from which they are trafficked. We also have to bear very much in mind that the majority of those doing the trafficking are outside this country and face absolutely no penalty as a result of what they are doing. Some time ago I visited Downview prison and was made well aware of that point by talking to the many women there who had been trafficked. I will not go into the stories but they were fairly horrendous.</p>

She says that most of the trafficking takes place outside this country, which is of course true for those who capture these unfortunate women in the first place. However, when these women have been captured and brought into this country, there must be agents of those external traffickers who continue the work of controlling and supplying them. Surely it is those people whom our police should, in the first instance, be observing, arresting and controlling, especially as they have ample communications with police overseas.

The Government are in this strange half light of criminalising men for something that they cannot know that they are doing. That is an exceptionally undesirable position for the Government. I know that we will visit this issue later, but not while I am here. The Government should think again and say, &#147;We have gone down the wrong road and Clause 13 is not the right way to do it&#148;. The amendment is an improvement on Clause 13, but I urge my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, when they divide the House&#151;if not now, then on Report&#151;rather to go for eliminating Clause 13 altogether.</p>

In the end, it will be a law that, among other things, will bite the poor, not the rich. It attacks the forms of prostitution used by ordinary working men, not those used by rich men. That is unjustifiable social discrimination. Again, if the Government were being honest and had gone for the position expressed by my noble friend Lord Waddington and their own original desire to ban paying for sex, that would bite all equally. The Government&#146;s social conscience should not allow them to go down this route.</p>

It was inevitable that it would not only spread across Clause 13 and Amendments 45 and 56 but spill over into some of the issues that have strong support inside and outside this Chamber, whether it is to decriminalise prostitution completely or to ban paying for sex completely. Indeed, we could inevitably start to stray into the next major contentious issue, which is strict liability. However, I shall follow the good advice of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and not stray into that area until we reach it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09070164000204"></a>We are grateful for the constructive attempt to improve this clause, which has already gone through another place. We have considered the issues raised by Amendments 45 and 56 but none the less still believe that Clause 13 and the amendments that we have tabled to improve it represent the best way of defining the elements of this offence and finding a clear distinction between conduct that we wish to cover and the conduct that we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09070164000205"></a>Before I deal with the amendment in detail, I should like to explain the rationale for the offence created by Clause 13 and set out in general terms what it is intended to cover. I assure noble Lords that the offence is very much intended to be part of the Government&#146;s response to the problem of trafficking. I sense from some of the contributions that there may be a fear that we are talking about creating a new offence as a substitute for our efforts, through law enforcement, to get trafficking under control, to get the traffickers into court and to prosecute them. However, nothing could be further from the truth. This is simply another weapon in the armoury and not an attempt to reduce our endeavours to ensure that the horrible trafficking of women for sex is brought to a halt as soon as possible. This is very much part of a general response to the problem of trafficking. Taking steps to tackle the demand for trafficking for sexual exploitation was one of the actions recommended in the <I>UK Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking</I>. It was also a requirement imposed by Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which the UK has now ratified.</p>

However, the concerns behind these amendments go beyond the protection of those who have been trafficked; they also include a wish to tackle other forms of exploitative prostitution, which I assure those who have tabled the amendment is also the Government&#146;s aim.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09070164000207"></a>We see a need to reduce all forms of commercial sexual exploitation. That is one of the key objectives of the Government&#146;s co-ordinated prostitution strategy, which sets out a comprehensive approach to tackling this issue. Many of the action points in the strategy have already been put in place. However, a number of the responses to the consultation, which informed the development of the strategy, emphasised the need to consider doing much more to tackle the demand for prostitution. That relates to the Government&#146;s attempt to create a culture shift in how we view prostitution and how we deal with it at law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09070164000208"></a>As part of the Government&#146;s review on tackling demand, we considered the approaches taken to prostitution in different countries. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked whether we had looked at the situation in New Zealand. Prostitution was decriminalised in New Zealand in 2003 under the Prostitution Reform Act. It is now a regulated endeavour and, under the provisions of the Act, brothels and escort agencies are required to be licensed and to have operator licences. We considered such an approach, but responses to the consultation and the evidence that we considered, which are highlighted in the review on tackling demand, supported taking a different approach&#151;increasing criminal justice enforcement measures to tackle demand in order to target exploitation within the prostitution market. Our view is that it is not yet clear whether the New Zealand approach has proved to be effective and whether, in the long term, it would be beneficial. The noble Baroness referred to a five-year review, but I do not think that we have had sight of it at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09070164000209"></a>To tackle demand, it would be necessary to criminalise those who contribute to the demand for trafficking and other forms of sexual exploitation by paying for sex with those who are subject to exploitation and to deter those who pay for sex in such circumstances. We considered the option of criminalising those who pay for sex whatever the circumstances of the prostitute, but concluded that that was not the right approach. Instead, the review recommended that measures should be targeted at reducing areas of the sex market involving the most vulnerable&#151;those who have been trafficked, exploited or involved in street prostitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09070164000210"></a>The offence is targeted at those who are forced or coerced into providing sexual services, which may be as a result of being trafficked but may also be a result of other forms of exploitative conduct. We recognise that defining such conduct is not easy; amendments have been tabled both in another place and for discussion in this Committee to ensure that the definition is as clear as possible. As a result of the constructive approach that has been taken thus far, we have been able to  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_252"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>create an offence that is clear and which achieves its aim of criminalising those who pay for sex with someone who is subject to exploitation.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09070164000211"></a>I shall now set out why we believe that these amendments are not helpful in achieving that aim and shall try to respond to some of the points made by noble Lords. We note that the amendments would make it an offence to pay for sex with &#147;the victim of trafficking&#148;. While we understand the sentiments behind that, the wording is problematic. It would mean that, where someone who had been trafficked escaped from the traffickers yet chose to work as a prostitute, it would still be an offence to have sex with that person if one knew, or ought to have known, of the person&#146;s past. Given the definition of trafficking, the person would not need to have been trafficked into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation. They could have been trafficked for labour purposes, as we have seen in some parts of the agriculture sector.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09070164000212"></a>The clause focuses on the conduct that is likely to be induced or which encourages the person to provide a sexual service to the payer. It covers cases in which a prostitute is coerced by traffickers but correctly excludes those cases when a person who was once trafficked to the UK now chooses to provide sexual services of her own volition. They will not be covered. The amendments would also cover those paying for sex with someone who has been subject to coercion. We have tabled amendments that make it clear that any form of coercion will be covered by Clause 13 offences. That includes threats of a non-violent nature, such as threats to withdraw accommodation or emotional support if the person does not provide sexual services. Government Amendments 52 and 62, which we will consider later, will cover that.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09070164000213"></a>Amendments 45 and 46 would also make it an offence to pay for sex with a person who provides sexual services to gain access to controlled drugs. Clause 13, as currently drafted, deals with the issue of a prostitute agreeing to provide sexual services because her pimp has threatened that he will otherwise refuse to supply her with controlled drugs. However, it will not cover someone who decides to work as a prostitute and chooses to use the money to pay for controlled drugs. By contrast, Amendment 45 would cover both those scenarios and, as such, is too wide. While we accept that there are clearly circumstances in which people provide sexual services under desperate conditions, including to gain money for drugs, catching those who pay for sex with someone who has freely chosen to engage in prostitution and then spends the money that they receive on drugs would be beyond the aim of the offence, particularly as it makes no distinction between those who are feeding an addiction and those who may be occasional recreational drug users.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09070164000214"></a>The amendment would also make it an offence to pay for sex with someone who had been directed or instructed to provide sexual services in circumstances when they had not consented to such direction. We would expect Clause 13 as drafted to cover most of the scenarios. If someone does not consent to a direction, one assumes that they would be free to ignore it, unless the direction was backed up by some force or threat. We believe that such conduct is already covered and falls within the scope of Clauses 13 and 14.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09070164000215"></a>We also note that the offence created by the amendments would cover someone who has used the services of a prostitute who had been trafficked or coerced or was otherwise considered to be exploited under this definition, rather than just someone who has paid for sexual services. There is a danger that the offence would criminalise consenting relationships, such as those between prostitutes and their partner or spouse, as there is no requirement for payment to be made when the person uses the sexual services of the prostitute in that circumstance. It is the payment to those controlling the prostitutes that fuels the demand, so that is the act on which we wish to focus our endeavours.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09070164000216"></a>The amendments also address the issue of strict liability by making it a requirement of the offence that the sex-buyer knew, or ought to have known, that the person whom they paid to have sex with had been trafficked, coerced, or the like. Although we understand and take seriously the concerns of the supporters of the amendment&#151;indeed, such concerns have been raised in another place&#151;we believe that it is important to maintain the strict liability element of the offence, for reasons that I will explain more fully when we consider Amendments 46, 50, 57 and 60. I also intend to deal with the concerns raised by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, in respect of the Joint Committee on Human Rights about the strict liability element of the offence when we come to debate those amendments.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09070164000217"></a>Several important points were made by noble Lords, which I will seek to address. They cluster, in some ways. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, gave an excellent analysis of the problem that we have in dealing with trafficking and how we have to make more endeavours not only to control the importation of prostitutes who are trafficked but to deal with the demand side. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, rightly said that there is an improvement in the prosecution rates. It is relatively recent, but prosecutions have been increasing as policies have been developed by the police to respond to the threat, such as intelligence-led, co-ordinated operations across police forces, which can be successful in identifying trafficking activities and rescuing victims. On the question raised by the noble and learned Baroness about providing some form of immunity for those who give evidence to convict traffickers and brothel owners, we do not believe that blanket immunity would be suitable. However, the CPS has discretion to decide where it is in the public interest to prosecute when a Clause 13 offence is thought to have taken place. The decision is taken in each individual case.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09070164000218"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd raised the issue of support for criminal legislation. A number of voluntary organisations working with prostitutes support criminal legislation to tackle demand and support Clause 13&#151;CARE, Toynbee Hall, the POPPY project and others. Of course, there are those who would want decriminalisation to be the first option, but in the absence of decriminalisation they want the Government to do far more to ensure that the demand side is tackled.</p>

<a name="90701-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09070164000219"></a>I hope that I have dealt with most of the questions. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, asked how, if the individual did not know, the police would  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_254"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be able make a case for prosecution. The police would in such circumstances try not simply to arrest the person who was paying for the trafficked prostitute but to collect sufficient evidence so that the trafficker, the brothel owner and the sex-buyer were all in the frame, as you might say. We want to tackle the demand for such prostitutes. They, the trafficked people, are not the problem; it is the market that we seek to control.</p>

It seems to me that, if the person has been trafficked, in order to make the arrest and bring a successful prosecution, the arresting officer has to be able to prove who were the controllers in this country, or whoever was controlling that unfortunate woman&#151;likewise with the victim of a pimp and the instances that the Minister gives of the supply of drugs. There is really no point in the police arresting the client unless they have knowledge that will enable them to arrest the cause of the problem, which is not the girl&#151;or, indeed, the client&#151;but the person who is controlling the unfortunate lady. That was my point.</p>

The difference is simply that he is seeing this as a one-dimensional picture. Many of these traffickers and the brothels in which prostitutes work&#151;they are moved between different locations&#151;will be matters of covert police investigation. The police will build up evidence over time. It may well not be a case of arresting all those in the building at the time. The covert operation may identify people who use the trafficked prostitutes and, when that evidence has been built up, arrests can be made. The collection of evidence is not the easiest of tasks. To return to a point made by the noble and learned Baroness, it is extremely difficult to capture and bring to court traffickers on an international basis. That is why international co-operation&#151;</p>

To prove that she has been trafficked, you must surely have to know something about who has done the trafficking. That is the point my noble friend made, and I did not think that the Minister quite answered it.</p>

If a brothel is under observation and it is suspected that prostitutes are being trafficked, primarily because they are being moved between different cities, which is quite a common occurrence, the place will be kept under observation for a number of days.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_255"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>People will be seen going in and coming out, prostitutes will be seen going in and coming out and the movements of the people running the brothel will be seen. At some point, sufficient evidence will have been gathered to make arrests. They will be made in the light of those observations. We are going on to the question of strict liability; the person who has been to that brothel will be interviewed by the police and, under strict liability, cannot defend himself by saying that he did not know, provided, of course, that we ensure that when this becomes law, there is sufficient publicity to ensure that men understand that there is that risk that if they use prostitutes, there will be circumstances in which they may find themselves fined up to &#163;1,000. I hope that makes it a little clearer.</p>

Surely when the police make this famous arrest, the activity in the brothel is likely to change immediately. People will all bolt like scalded cats in all directions. The Minister has not answered the question about what is in the knowledge of the police to make a successful arrest under this clause.</p>

I shall try it again. You have customers for the prostitutes; you have eastern European&#151;we will say eastern European, but they could be from any part of the world&#151;prostitutes who are moving between cities. The police gather evidence and raid the establishment after observing who has come and who has gone. They will make criminal charges against the traffickers and the brothel owners, but the customers will have committed an offence if it turns out that the prostitutes were trafficked because under strict liability legislation customers will be liable whether they knew that the person was trafficked or not.</p>

The first is that of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas: that the outcome of this legislation is that the part of the sex industry that is used and worked in by poor people will be criminalised while the rest is unaffected. Secondly, can the Minister confirm whether, while there are a few organisations working with sex workers who support the Government&#146;s approach, there is a coalition of all the projects that actually work with street prostitutes? I think there are 63 of them but I am sure that the Minister will correct me. None of them support the Government&#146;s approach and feel that it will make the work of those they try to help much more dangerous.</p>

I think the question of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was whether that was the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

On the second point, our endeavours in this piece of legislation are of course to protect the most vulnerable. As we go through all clauses, not just this one, I hope that we can demonstrate not only the Government&#146;s intent but that this is a constructive way of achieving it. I recognise that there are very strong opinions on the issue, and that those arguments will echo around as we go forward. We will seek to find our way through them.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09070164000232"></a>I look at the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, simply because he is one of those to criticise more recently and, perhaps, directly; many have voiced not doubts about our intent or beliefs that our intent is not in good faith, but questions on whether we will have the benefit of unintended consequence, as my noble friend Lord Desai put it. I am frankly not sure that I buy the economic argument being translated into this field, which is not simply a transaction. In fact, I am reminded that labour in any form is not a commodity.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09070164000233"></a>I am pleased and grateful for the support of the right reverend Prelate, who makes a good point. This is not a moral issue, but one of how we protect very vulnerable people. We have responded to the specific concerns raised in the other place, echoed here by the amendments we have tabled. The version of Clause 13 that we want to introduce will best address the aim of protecting vulnerable people involved in prostitution. It will address many of the circumstances that Amendments 45 and 56 would cover. I hope that your Lordships will appreciate why the Government have taken this view, and respectfully ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="09070164000234"></a><b><a name="90701-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070164000454"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> That has been an incredibly helpful debate in drawing out the confusion that lies behind the Government&#146;s approach at the moment&#151;whether they are actually talking about stopping trafficking. We had some fantastic contributions on the issue, starting with the tour de force of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about why we must address trafficking. On that issue, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, mentioned the presentation by the Director of Public Prosecutions which I went to as well last Monday. When he did not directly address this Bill, he talked about all the legislation that could be used against traffickers and mentioned the increasing expertise of the CPS. The evidence that the DPP presented to us on Monday, which the Government could follow, is that the existing legislation should be used better, not that we need more legislation.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09070164000235"></a>Is this clause about reducing demand? I do not think that the Minister has proved the case for that at all. He referred to the police observing the comings and goings at brothels but he did not explain how the clause would reduce demand. Having to ascertain where a prostitute comes from will not make men feel less like buying sex but will mean that they are more likely to buy it from someone with a British accent.

I thoroughly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that the provision is dishonest as rich men will still be able to keep their mistresses in flats and call that something other than buying prostitution, although that is what it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09070164000236"></a>I am not on a moral crusade although I say to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester that I do not think there is anything wrong with a moral crusade provided it is on the right issues. I absolutely agree with his comments about the abhorrent practice of the increasing sexualisation of children, and that such issues are not addressed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09070164000237"></a>I am especially grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who added their names to my amendment and spoke so powerfully on it. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, said that we should aim to have legislation which makes it easier for the client to report these issues. Other noble Lords also made that point powerfully. That is exactly what we should be aiming for, but I heard nothing in the Minister&#146;s reply which suggests that is the road he is going down. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, is absolutely right about the coalition that certainly does not support the Government&#146;s stance and is deeply worried about it. The Minister slightly dismissed the New Zealand evaluation. However, as pointed out by my noble friend Lady Tonge, who speaks on health matters but is unable to be here today, in addition to the trafficking, health issues should worry the Government and they should concentrate on those. The New Zealand evaluation forcefully addresses health issues.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09070164000238"></a>Possibly for the first time I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, although I am very pleased that that is the case. He made some extremely good points which are very well taken. I am glad that he pursued them. The Minister says that this clause is simply another weapon in the armoury. The Government are creating a cannon&#151;to continue the metaphor&#151;when they need a sniper&#146;s rifle, which they already have, as the DPP said. I worry that the cannon, when fired, will catch all sorts of innocent and vulnerable people, including the children of prostitutes. It is absolutely the wrong mechanism. We will work strenuously with the Government to consider how the Bill can address trafficking more forcefully and we shall return to Clause 13 on Report. The comments made by noble Lords all round the Chamber lead me to the conclusion that the Bill would be better off without this clause. However, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Inevitably, the debate has strayed a little between these two amendments. I am amazed that we have managed to hang on to this amendment, which stands very much on its own and is a very important part of what we are discussing.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09070164000240"></a>I am very grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for this amendment. I think that she will join me in saying that one of the greatest concerns of many noble Lords is the imposition of the strict liability on the defendant and that there is no defence against the charge that he was going to have or had had sex with a prostitute who had been trafficked.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09070164000241"></a>I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that it is an extremely serious matter to put someone in jeopardy of the law by an incontestable assumption of guilt. In the case of a person who seeks sex from a prostitute who&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has already raised this&#151;at a later date is found to have been trafficked, exploited or abused, in hiring her for sex he commits an offence whether or not he knows or has any reason to believe that she has been trafficked. This assumption of knowledge as a basis for prosecution clashes, we believe, with natural justice. At least an offence should be committed only if it can be proved that the defendant could reasonably have known that the prostitute had been trafficked.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09070164000242"></a>I know that many will disagree with giving even this limited amount of defence and we have heard a little of that today. There are those who believe that these provisions will, because of the jeopardy in which the punter is being placed, reduce the amount of prostitution per se. Again, we have discussed the purpose of Clause 13. Many see this as a moral issue, but because this clause and the offence are so prescriptive it is in our view solely an issue of justice.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09070164000243"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have been inundated with e-mails, letters and briefings. This issue has led to an enormous amount of lobbying from both sides on all aspects of Clause 13. Quite rightly, concern over exploited prostitutes&#146; welfare has led to the involvement of many organisations, all of which are seeking the same result: largely the ending of all prostitution&#151;again, we have discussed that briefly&#151;whether there is evidence of trafficking or not. There are those who believe that this proposed legislation is unworkable in that the offence will be almost impossible to prove. So it will not achieve its aims of reducing the number of prostitutes who are controlled by pimps or who help to make prostitutes any safer.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09070164000244"></a>We need to remind ourselves again that prostitution per se is not a crime, although a good many offences are attached to it. Contrasting views and opposing testimony show just how important it is that the legislation is clear, unambiguous and, above all, does what is intended. The primary reason for this offence being promoted is to seek to protect those who are exploited and trafficked for sex, and to reduce the opportunities for those generating and profiting from that exploitation.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09070164000245"></a>These are laudable aims, but we must remember that unworkable law will not help anyone. It will not support the victims seeking protection from exploitation

An offence that proves to be impossible to prosecute will only waste the enforcement agency&#146;s time and resources, and add yet another layer of confusion to an industry already operating in the shadows. In the Minister&#146;s reply to the previous amendment, we got some indication of how the Government see this working, but as I understand it it also requires the police and other agencies to have or to obtain knowledge that someone had been trafficked. They may or may not get that information from the punter if the punter is under threat of prosecution.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09070164000246"></a>The question of whether the offence should be one of strict liability has been considered by a great many bodies. The Joint Committee on Human Rights is surely not a committee that one would ever suggest did not take the protection of the vulnerable seriously enough. It clearly stated that the Government have failed to demonstrate the necessity for the new strict liability offence. It stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09070164000285"></a>&#147;In our view, the proposed offence has the potential to put women into more exploitative or unsafe situations, may not address the problem which the offence aims to target (namely exploitative prostitution) and may discourage reporting of such prostitution.&#148;</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09070164000247"></a>Justice, another organisation dedicated to the protection of human rights and the improvement of the legal system, also opposes a strict liability offence, as do Liberty and the Bar Council. All these organisations believe that the human rights issues in such an offence, couched as it is and being one of strict liability, make it extremely unlikely that a conviction will ever be achieved.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09070164000248"></a>All that this offence will result in is an even lower incidence of reporting as punters shy away from talking to the police for fear that they will be prosecuted for an offence against which they would have no defence. I hope that the Government, who in the next group of amendments indicate that they are listening to the concerns being raised about aspects of this clause, will also listen to our concerns. In moving the amendment we are looking at the adequacy or otherwise of the fairness of a prosecution. In doing so, I do not dismiss nor am I unsympathetic to the grave concerns being expressed, but this House as well as the other place need to be clear that when they put legislation for offences on to the statute book, it is fair and just. I beg to move.</p>

She was convicted of managing premises used for the purpose of smoking cannabis on the ground that the offence was an absolute one and that it was therefore unnecessary to prove knowledge. She did, in fact, manage the premises. The premises were, in fact, used for smoking cannabis and therefore that was thought to be sufficient for her conviction. When her case reached the House of Lords, her appeal was allowed. I want to quote only two sentences from the speech of Lord Reid&#151;the great Lord Reid, as I think one can call him. On page 148 he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09070164000286"></a>&#147;How has it come about that the Divisional Court has felt bound to reach such an obviously unjust result?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000269"></a>Later on at page 151 he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09070164000287"></a>&#147;Speaking from a rather long experience of membership of both Houses, I assert with confidence that no Parliament within my recollection would have agreed to make an offence of this kind an absolute offence if the matter had been fully explained&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070164000270"></a>To adapt those words of Lord Reid to the present case, it seems to me that to convict a defendant of an offence under Clause 13 when he does not know and has no means of knowing that she was a controlled prostitute would be, in the words of Lord Reid, obviously unjust. As to the second quotation, Parliament may have changed since the days of Lord Reid, but I cannot believe that we have deteriorated so far as to make an offence of the kind set out in Clause 13 into an absolute offence without proof of knowledge.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09070164000251"></a>The clause is all the more wrong-headed because I cannot see how, as it stands, it would achieve its object. Prostitution is not a crime. I do not see how this clause will serve to protect prostitutes&#151;an important consideration; how it will reduce the demand for prostitution&#151;as is said to be the case; and still less how it will reduce the number of pimps.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09070164000252"></a>I confess that when I first saw Clause 13 I was astonished. That was many, many months ago and, for what it may be worth, I expressed that astonishment in a public lecture. I do so again today. I will be happy to see the clause if it is amended as is now proposed, but not otherwise.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09070164000254"></a>Your Lordships will, I am sure, accept that strict liability crimes are sometimes justified in the context of sexual offences. An example, which I hope is illuminating for our purposes, is Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which makes it an offence for a person to have sex with a child who is under the age of 13 irrespective of whether the defendant knew or ought to have known of the age of the victim. The differences between Section 5 and Clause 13 illustrate the problems with the proposed offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09070164000255"></a>Your Lordships may know that in June 2008, in the case of R v G, the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#146; House considered and dismissed the argument by a man convicted of an offence under Section 5&#151;having sex with a child under the age of 13&#151;that the strict liability element in the Section 5 offence was a breach of his human rights. But the Appellate Committee emphasised that there were strong policy reasons for making that offence one of strict liability. The object  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_261"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there was both to protect children from predatory adults and to protect the child from premature sexual activity of all kinds.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09070164000256"></a>It is much more difficult to identify any policy which can justify strict liability in the present context. As noble Lords have already pointed out, it is not the policy of the Bill that all prostitution should be made a criminal offence by the customer; nor is the Government likely to accept the arguments powerfully advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that paying a prostitute for sexual services should be made a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09070164000257"></a>In Clause 13, one faces the difficulty that the relevant ingredients of the offence are not clear by contrast with the Section 5 strict liability offence. In the context of Section 5 on having sex with a child under the age of 13, the child either is or is not under the age of 13. The age is discoverable by a number of means. By contrast, Clause 13 would mean that whether the criminal offence was committed by the customer would depend on specific factual matters&#151;that is, whether a third person has used force, deception or threats or engaged in exploitative conduct&#151;as outlined in the Government&#146;s proposed amendment. But such matters are not objective; they are not incontrovertible facts but highly contentious matters. Indeed, they will inevitably be the subject of dispute between the prostitute and the third party.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09070164000258"></a>In the light of this, my question to the Minister is: can he give the Committee any other example of a strict-liability offence where that liability arises in a context that is not one where there is an absolute prohibition on defined conduct by reference to an objective criterion such as a person&#146;s age, such as in Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act, but rather an example of a case where strict liability applies only where criminal liability occurs that is dependent on so vague and contentious a criterion that is referable to the alleged conduct of a third party?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09070174000002"></a>I sat through the previous debate, though I did not take part. As noble Lords who were here will know, it lasted for about an hour and was fully comprehensive on all sorts of matters, including what we are discussing now. However, I did not hear the Minister explain with any clarity what the justification was for making a person who obtains sexual services from a controlled prostitute liable for a criminal offence irrespective of his knowledge, likely knowledge or &#147;should-be knowledge&#148; of whether the prostitute giving her services had been forced to do so.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09070174000003"></a>I am still extremely unclear on that point, except&#151;although he is not in his place, I am referring here to the noble Lord, Lord Waddington&#151;on the basis that the Government&#146;s real objective is to bring about an end to, or a ban on, the provision of sexual services for money. If that is the Government&#146;s intention, Clause 13  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_262"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 262</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is a most powerful deterrent to a man obtaining sexual services from a prostitute; irrespective of whether or not he knew that she was controlled, he would be liable under the Bill. I am therefore against Clause 13.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09070174000004"></a>As with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, the reason why I am uncertain about being in favour of the amendment is that, with all the good will in the world towards an amendment of this kind, and for the legal policy reasons that have been explained by those who have spoken before me, I do not think it would achieve its objective. Looking at it from the prosecution&#146;s point of view, how on earth in practice is the prosecution going to prove, except in the most remote cases, knowledge or &#147;ought-to-have knowledge&#148; of the controlled nature of the prostitute&#146;s services? In amending the Government&#146;s Bill we would be putting forward a criminal offence that would be almost impossible to prove.</p>

<a name="90701-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09070174000005"></a>If the amendment were part of the law, those who control the prostitute would make it their business to ensure that the women concerned made no reference to, and gave no indication of, where they had come from in Eastern Europe or wherever, how they had got there or anything else. Therefore, although I support what has been said in criticism of Clause 13, I do not feel that I can support the amendment. I would rather simply eliminate Clause 13 and, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, explained in the previous debate, use more effectively the existing laws we have against traffickers. We should go for the traffickers, not the man or the woman seeking or providing sexual services.</p>

We have heard the legal arguments and I want to advance a little more evidence. A very interesting study, at which I have had an advance look, will be published on 10 July. It has been commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council at the University of East London and is entitled <I>Migrants in the UK Sex Industry</I> by Dr Nick Mai. There are many conclusions but the ones relevant to this discussion show why it would be so difficult for a client to know. Not all prostitutes are women who have been trafficked; we often think of them as helpless victims who have been kidnapped. Dr Mai found that many of the people interviewed were from relatively privileged backgrounds who had aspirations to improve their living conditions. They had employed traffickers to help them come to this country. They paid money to be trafficked. Are they victims? They were self-determining; they chose that for themselves, partly because for those with undocumented status, the sex industry provides a way of working away from the public eye as it is largely informal. There were many more findings of that nature. So knowing whether someone is actually a victim and is being coerced is not that simple.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09070174000010"></a>The second finding that has some bearing on this debate is that less than 10 per cent of the people interviewed had experience of exploitation. In all those cases, the clients played a key role in their strategy for escape. Women count on their clients, and if the clients are criminalised, they will not be able to help.</p>

The starting point is not somebody innocently caught up, which is where the case of the person who found that a lodger was smoking cannabis behind a locked door is not an exact analogy. We are starting with someone who is paying for sex. It may be that behind this, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, suggested,

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09070174000014"></a>To use the Minister&#146;s phrase when he responded to the previous debate, the issue turns on whether we need a whole culture shift in the area of prostitution. I think that the Government take the view that we do. There is a growth in prostitution and those who are engaged in it are now increasingly exploited in the most dreadful way. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, gave a vivid illustration of that earlier. In fact, the girl to whom the noble and learned Baroness referred had in all but name been raped. Think how we in this country regard rape. A lot of the prostitution that occurs in this country is in all but name rape. In those circumstances, I think that the Government are right to say that something has to be done&#151;something which targets the worst examples and aims to achieve a culture shift.</p>

That is the problem. It is not an offence in this country thus far to pay for sex with a consenting partner. Therefore, if you say, &#147;Ah, but this man has paid for sex, therefore the rest follows&#148;, you have to be very careful.

There are a lot of people who say that it is wrong and a lot of people who say that it is not, but the Government have to say one way or the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09070174000020"></a>However, to take part of the problem and use a strict liability clause to do it is anathema to most people and not just to lawyers. One has to be very careful in either House of Parliament to approve of strict liability, despite what the right reverend Prelate said&#151;I respect his view but, in my view, he is wrong. A strict liability clause is such a serious matter that one has to be very careful. To use it as part of a culture change seems not to meet the problem. The Government have to nail their colours to the mast and say whether it is wrong for men to pay for sex or only for some men to pay for sex with women who are trafficked. Those men are not all that evil; it is the traffickers who provide the women and, particularly, the children. The Government criminalise the children under 18 at the moment, and will continue to do so unless the relevant amendments are put through&#151;I may not be able to be here for those. I hope that the Government will listen on children under 18. They say that they are victims, but they can also be criminalised and prosecuted. To go for the men in part of it is not to meet the problem. If it is a question of a culture change, the Government should nail their colours to the mast and get on with it.</p>

Perhaps I may begin by responding to the points of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. The right reverend Prelate said that it is a culture shift. We are not saying that consensual sex between a man who pays for it and a woman who is happy to receive money and is not trafficked or coerced in any way is illegal. This is not a campaign to outlaw prostitution; it is a campaign to persuade men to desist from exploiting women who are victims of trafficking or coercion. The provision will therefore be an amber flag or a red flag, signalling to people to think long and hard about it.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09070174000022"></a>I shall speak to all the amendments in this group, Amendments 46, 50, 57 and 60. Much has been said about the difficulty of getting a prosecution, even using Clause 13, complete with its strict liability. However, the strict liability aspect, which makes it illegal to pay for sex with someone who is subjected to force, deception or threat, is likely to have the effect of reducing demand. If men know in advance that if they are found to have been with someone who is in that situation, they are liable for a fine in court and a criminal record.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09070174000023"></a>The amendments would make it a requirement of the offence that the sex buyer knew, or ought to know, that the person whom they had paid for sex had been

The amendments would allow the defendants to argue, which they are certain to do, that they did not know the circumstances of the prostitute. However, the amendments would add a mental element that would make the offence even more difficult to prosecute than it would be under strict liability.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09070174000024"></a>If a mental element was added to the offence, the defence would be available, and would be highly likely to be used, that the person did not know. It would also increase the need for victim testimony, which we wish to avoid given the trauma that trafficked women already experience. Furthermore, many people who have been forced, threatened or deceived in prostitution are vulnerable and inevitably subject to pressure. They may be pressurised to say that they had not been forced even though they had. The Government are attempting in this part of the legislation to make it clear that men should think long and hard about the form of prostitution they are getting involved in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09070174000025"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, drew the House&#146;s attention to a speech made in the other place by the right honourable John Gummer MP, who said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070174000123"></a>&#147;if someone wishes to pay for sex, they must recognise that in doing so they take on a particular burden. If they think that what they are doing is reasonable, they must recognise that the downside is with them and not with the woman concerned&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/5/09; col. 1438.]</ul>
<p><a name="09070174000109"></a>The risk of responsibility should rest with the payer to ensure that he does not pay for sex with someone who has been forced, threatened or coerced. It should not be a defence for the payer simply to say, &#147;I did not know that the prostitute was forced, threatened or deceived&#148;. He knows that if he pays for sex he runs the risk that the person may be subject to exploitative conduct and that he is fuelling the demand for prostitutes and trafficking for such purposes. Indeed, he is lining the pockets of traffickers and pimps exploiting prostitutes for their own gain.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09070174000026"></a>We know that some people involved in prostitution are in the most desperate circumstances&#151;we have heard about it in this debate&#151;and are exploited tremendously by those seeking to gain from their involvement in prostitution. We want to ensure that sex buyers consider the circumstances of the prostitute and that such prostitutes are protected by the law so far as is possible. If a sex buyer proceeds with the transaction without being sure of the circumstances, they also should face the consequences.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09070174000027"></a>To support the legislation, we shall run a public education campaign aimed at making people aware of the reality of life for many prostitutes and the potential consequences of paying for sex with someone who could have been coerced into providing sexual services. This is one of the recommendations of the tackling demand review. Together with the offence introduced by Clause 13 and the other recommendations of the review, it will form part of the cultural shift that we hope to achieve by creating greater responsibility on the part of the sex buyer.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09070174000028"></a>We were obviously aware of the concerns about Clause 13 that were raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I have no doubt that your Lordships would find it helpful if I set out our response to those concerns.</p>

I have already made it clear that I am not a lawyer, so I speak for somebody who saw this clause and said at once, &#147;This is way outside what seems to me to be the normal process of law in this country&#148;. Is the Minister saying that the particular action of a man having sex with a prostitute is so serious that, by all definitions, he has no defence whatever, even if he has no means of finding out whether somebody has been trafficked? That seems so far away from a court of law being able to listen to, balance and weigh the arguments and understand where there is a defence and where there is not. This is so far away from that that one has to ask whether this offence is so much more serious than any of the others&#151;we have been quoted some&#151;that one has to take away all possibility of a defence. We need an answer to that.</p>

The question was whether the offence is so serious that it overrides all the points made by my noble friend and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. The Government cannot see, understand or grasp the majesty of the defence and liberty of the subject and the rule of law when they introduce a clause such as this. It is a disgrace.</p>

I was dealing specifically with the point relating to the human rights element, and the point that the noble Baroness raised. It is a question of the degree of seriousness. We can take the examples that we have heard in this debate today of women who are raped, terrified and mistreated. In a situation where a person has an opportunity not to pay that person and not to go to that brothel but also has a liability if they do so&#151;and it turns out that the woman is in those circumstances&#151;we are simply saying that the buyer has to take part of that responsibility. It is a matter of judgment of some contention, as we have heard in this debate, whether that is something that noble Lords wish to see placed in this part of the Bill.</p>

We are&#151;or I certainly am&#151;still struggling with the fact that we have legislation in place, whether for trafficking, rape or violence against women, which allows a defence. Why is this so different? I agree that it is abhorrent if a client rapes a woman, and lots of prostitutes are subjected to violence. There are courses of action that can be taken within the law against them.</p>

First, we are satisfied that the Clause 13 defence complies both with the European Convention on Human Rights and the principles of common law. We do not accept that Article 8, which is about the protection of a person&#146;s private and family life, includes the right to pay for

Secondly, in any event, we consider that any interference with a person&#146;s private life would be in accordance with the law and could be justified as necessary and proportionate for the protection of health and morals and of the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09070174000035"></a>The issue with rape and prostitution is that rape is, of course, very difficult to prove, but here is a situation where a coerced prostitute is being exploited both by the person paying for the sex and, more particularly, by the trafficker or brothel owner. In that context, we seek the culture shift that says that someone using a prostitute in a brothel must take note that, if he does so, he will automatically be guilty if he finds afterwards that the person he has been with is coerced.</p>

The educational programme is in the endeavour, in the event of this becoming law, that people who are in the situation of using prostitutes have knowledge in advance of what the situation is and what the law is. That is the educational element.</p>

<a name="90701-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09070174000039"></a>The Human Rights Committee suggested that the offence is not sufficiently certain. We disagree; we believe that the clause is clear. If a person pays for sex with someone who is has been subject to force, threats or deception, they will commit an offence. If someone intends to pay for sex and has any doubt whether a prostitute is being controlled for gain, they can choose not to pay for sex with that person. It is important to make the distinction between legal and factual certainty; it is important that the offence is legally certain so that the person knows that, if all the factual elements of the offence occur, they will commit an offence. It may be difficult to know whether all the factual elements will occur in a particular case. However, this situation exists in other areas of criminal law. If an offender punches someone, intending to cause an injury, whether that person commits common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm will depend on the nature of the injury that results, which that person may not have been able to judge in advance when throwing the punch.</p>

It would be sensible to take away all the points that have been made in what has been a very full debate. The only hopeful note that I heard was when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said that there were only three lawyers in the Committee; I thought that that was less than normal. I take the point made in his contribution and that of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. It would be sensible for us to take back without commitment all the contributions in this debate and look again at the whole area of proposals.</p>

If a man has sexual relations with a woman who has been coerced, forced, threatened or whatever, the moral status is akin to rape. That is the serious moral issue lying behind the difficult legal judgment that the Government face. I hope that both issues will be taken away from this debate, not only the narrow legal point.</p>

My noble friend uses the word &#147;exploitation&#148;. Normally the consumer is unable to exploit; the producer may exploit the consumer, but it is very difficult for the consumer, with monopoly power, to do that. The Government want to punish the consumer for having exploited, because the exploiter is the producer whom the Government cannot catch. So it seems that if you catch the consumer you will by implication catch the person who is the real criminal. That is a bizarre way of doing business.</p>

Someone who goes with a prostitute who says, &#147;By the way, I am not here because I want to be here&#151;I am trafficked&#148;, and chooses to ignore that is clearly exploiting the individual. We are not seeking to punish the customer as such; we are trying to educate him so that he knows in law that he will commit an offence. That is the basis on which we go forward. I take entirely the point made by the right reverend Prelate; we will look at the situation in the round, without commitment to change, to see how we look at the matter with the advantage of having had a very full and well argued debate in several quarters. That is why I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09070174000059"></a>As the Bill passed through another place there was considerable debate over the potential scope of Clause 13. I am not sure, not having been present, whether it was a greater or a lesser debate in intensity and range of views than that we have had in the past hour or so. It is fair to say that there was a large degree of consensus on the need to ensure that those who had been forced or coerced into providing sexual services to a sex buyer were given the full protection of the law. There was recognition that this is what we are trying to achieve with this offence. The Government are grateful for the constructive votes taken thus far.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09070174000060"></a>We responded to many of the concerns raised, particularly the fear that Clause 13, as originally drafted, was too wide and that its definition could go beyond the exploitative and coercive circumstances which the offence was intended to cover. It was suggested that it would also cover those who pay for sex with someone who had freely chosen to work in prostitution under the limited direction of a madam. We do not wish such circumstances to be covered by the offence. Therefore,  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to address this concern directly we have made amendments in another place to clarify the scope of the offence. These amendments make clear that the offence will cover those who pay for sex with someone who has been subject to force, deception or threats by another person acting for or in the expectation of gain.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09070174000061"></a>However, in making these amendments we recognise the need to ensure that they do not limit the protection offered by this offence too much. We do not wish the offence to apply only to those who have paid for sex with someone who has been subject to physical force or threats. It is important that we recognise the psychological pressure that can be used to coerce someone into prostitution, and the effect that this can have on people who may be vulnerable. For example, a person seeking to involve another person in prostitution, or maintain their involvement in prostitution, may threaten to report that person to the immigration authorities if they know that person to be here illegally, possibly because they have been trafficked; or threats to withdraw emotional or practical support may be used and may have a particularly pernicious effect on those who are in a weak position compared to the person making the threats or otherwise coercing the prostitute.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09070174000062"></a>To ensure that these circumstances are covered by the offence, subsection (4) currently states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09070174000116"></a>&#147;For the purposes of this section &#145;force&#146; includes coercion by threats or other psychological means including exploitation of vulnerability&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070174000063"></a>That wording was inserted by a Back-Bench amendment, which we accepted on Report in another place on the basis that the Government would tidy up the wording by amendment in this House. Consequently, we have introduced Amendments 47, 49, 51, 52, 55, 58, 59, 61 and 62, which will ensure that Clause 13 makes it an offence for a person to pay or promise payment for sex with a prostitute if a third person has engaged in exploitative conduct of a kind likely to induce or encourage the prostitute to provide the sexual services for which the sex buyer has made or promised payment. Under Amendments 52 and 62 a person engages in exploitative conduct if he or she,</p>
<ul><a name="09070174000124"></a>&#147;uses force, threats (whether or not relating to violence) or any other form of coercion, or ... practises any form of deception&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070174000064"></a>This wording will replace that used in subsection (4).</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09070174000065"></a>I turn now to Amendment 48, which has been tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman. This would remove the requirement for the third party who had been responsible for the force, deception or threats to be acting for or in the expectation of gain for himself or another person. It would appear, at least theoretically, to allow the offence to apply to a wider set of circumstances as it would not be necessary to establish that the third party had acted in order for himself or another to benefit financially. While there is an argument that it should be illegal to pay for sex with anyone who has been subject to force, threats or deception, regardless of whether such behaviour is motivated by financial gain, financial gain is a significant element of the exploitation that we are trying to target with this offence. The offence is aimed at those who create a financial incentive for traffickers and pimps to coerce or deceive people into providing sexual services as a prostitute.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_273"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Reducing such demand therefore reduces the financial incentive for people to act as traffickers or otherwise coerce people into prostitution. The same does not apply where the third party is not acting for gain.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09070174000066"></a>We do not consider it likely that there would be many circumstances in which someone would behave in this way without the expectation of gain, although admittedly it is not inconceivable. I am therefore grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount for raising the issue. However, I hope they appreciate that, for the reasons I have set out, we are not inclined to accept Amendment 48.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09070174000067"></a>The amendments that we have tabled are an attempt to recognise the range of circumstances in which people are coerced into prostitution and to ensure that no vulnerable person who has been coerced into providing sexual services is excluded from the protection offered by this offence.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09070174000068"></a>At the same time, it is important that the scope of this offence is clear. We are grateful for the constructive attempts that have so far been made to ensure that this aim is achieved. It has inevitably been a dynamic process involving close scrutiny and reflection, but we believe that these amendments will help us strike the right balance. They address many of the views expressed in the other place and will ultimately ensure that the offence achieves its aim of protecting vulnerable people coerced into prostitution by tackling the demand for such prostitutes. I beg to move.</p>

I am extremely grateful to him for answering it before I have spoken to it. That is perhaps an unusual way of doing things. I have heard the response and perhaps he would like to hear what the amendment is about.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09070174000070"></a>The Government have tabled a number of amendments further amending their definition of what constitutes exploitation. The number of amendments that they have brought forward to this clause indicates just how difficult it is to express clearly what is to be considered unacceptable, and what is to be considered acceptable.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09070174000071"></a>The drafting of this clause is fundamental to the eventual implementation of this offence, and I am not sorry that the Government are taking some care over it. But let us go through it. We started at &#147;intentionally controlled for gain&#148;; then we moved on to,</p>
<ul><a name="09070174000125"></a>&#147;used force, deception or threats&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09070174000110"></a>in the expectation of gain; and now we are looking at &#147;engaged in exploitative conduct&#148; in the expectation of gain.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09070174000072"></a>My amendment in this group probes why the question of gain is a material one in this offence. Off the top of my head, I cannot imagine a circumstance when exploitative behaviour is ever engaged in without gain to the exploiter, but even if such a situation existed, I cannot see that the question of whether there was gain matters one bit to the punter receiving the sexual services. Though the punter may very likely not know it, the prostitute involved is still being forced, threatened or deceived.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09070174000073"></a>This point has been put forward by Justice, which considers the expectation of gain irrelevant. I was going to ask the Minister whether he agrees with

I have already declared an interest in relation to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trafficking, which is one of the areas where we learn from the police, and indeed from those who are trafficked, the wide variety of ways in which people may be exploited. As I think the Government understand, I entirely disapprove of Clause 13&#151;I do not think that it should be in the Bill. However, if it is to be there, I very much commend the fact that the words have been given this much broader meaning. I also support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09070174000076"></a>By adding the words about exploitative acts and gain from exploitative acts, my noble friend has made the distinction that I was trying to make. Exploitation consists of the producer who hires the worker making a gain. The consumer may valorise that exploitation by buying the product or service but the consumer does not actually exploit. That is the point that I was trying to make.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09070174000077"></a>Let us consider the very sad case of the Chinese workers who died in Morecambe Bay. They were trafficked and worked as winkle-pickers or whatever it was. Somebody was going to make a material gain from having trafficked them. If they had not died, the person who bought what they had collected from the sea would have been guilty of buying something produced by trafficked labour. It would be very sad if that person was prosecuted for, as it were, valorising the exploitation of Chinese workers.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09070174000078"></a>The same applies here. Someone is hiring women to supply a service for his or her gain. Someone goes and buys the service, not necessarily knowing the nature of the supply. I think that we should concentrate on the supplier and punish him for doing this for gain rather than punishing the consumer, who need not know that he has bought a dodgy service. I welcome the amendment.</p>

We will come back to this in the debate on clause stand part.</p>

That in a sense is why this House has improved much legislation over the years by giving it greater scrutiny than that provided in another place.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09070174000081"></a>I am not sure that I can add anything to what I said before about Amendment 48. As I say, we think that the use of financial gain is an important element in two ways. First, it is unlikely that there would be exploitation without financial gain. Secondly, it partly explains what we are seeking to do to protect the vulnerable women who are coerced or trafficked. They are trafficked for the financial gain of others, rather than themselves. We want the punters, as we colloquially call them, to understand why we are seeking changes of behaviour on their part, so that they do not seek to go with people who are coerced and they understand the difficulties of people in that situation. We have heard that a high percentage, in some cases 90 per cent, of prostitutes in major cities in Britain, not just in London, are suspected of being trafficked or certainly brought to this country with promises of financial gain.</p>

Where has the Minister received that evidence from? On a previous amendment, I quoted to him very recent research, which I am sure he will look at. Where is he getting that figure of 90 per cent from? The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and I visited Soho in preparation for this Bill. That was not what we saw. He may have been offered completely different evidence, but the evidence that we had did not come anywhere near showing rates of around 90 per cent&#151;quite the reverse. The rates were probably between 10 and 15 per cent. I do not want to trade percentages with the Minister when there is no evidence, but I wonder where his evidence base has come from.</p>

The right reverend Prelate earlier mentioned figures in respect of prostitutes in London that included a very high element of trafficked women. I agree with the noble Baroness that it is not worth trading statistics. I will settle for saying that a substantial number of women in prostitution in this country are trafficked from abroad. We know that the figures on trafficking are horrendous enough not to have to worry too much about the statistics.</p>

Basically what he means is, &#147;I haven&#146;t the faintest idea what the percentage is&#148;. That is sloppy thinking at its worst.

I have heard that in this Chamber, but not only from these Benches. I will indeed take his suggestion and seek harder evidence. The noble Baroness mentions evidence from research of which I have no knowledge. I agree that it is sensible at least to try to discover the scale of the problem. I will seek to provide that information to the noble Earl and send a copy to the Library.</p>

My understanding from the work of which I have learnt is that a substantial number of women are trafficked for prostitution from outside the United Kingdom.

I am grateful for the contributions. Despite what the Minister said, I think that we will still disagree on whether gain is an important element. At the end of the day, the Minister has decided on a different approach. I accept that this is a difficult area and that is what we have ended up with. We may want to come back to the point about expectation of gain in due course, depending on what is decided on Clause 13. I just urge caution on the figures, because I have read a lot of briefings; they are all different and the figures depend on which ones you take on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09070174000091"></a>Unlike the noble Baroness whose amendments are grouped with mine, I have not selected an appropriate level that I think this offence warrants, for the simple reason that it all depends on whether the Government accept our arguments on the question of strict liability. That will determine which way this goes. If we win our argument on strict liability, I would agree entirely that the level of the offence should be raised significantly to reflect the severity of the crime. If there is no strict liability, there will be a serious offence for which for which there is a defence.</p>

<a name="90701-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09070174000092"></a>The ridiculously low level of the proposed fine shows just how weak this offence will be if it is implemented in its current form. The Government&#146;s insistence on a strict liability offence means that those who actively seek out trafficked prostitutes or those who simply do not care that the prostitute is clearly exploited can receive a fine of only up to &#163;1,000. In most cases it will be less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09070174000093"></a>The level of the fine clearly demonstrates that, as currently drafted, the offence will fail. Despite all the arguments used by the Minister, he must appreciate the damage that such a desultory fine, as well as the strict liability aspect, would do to the reputation of our justice system. We will need to look again at the level of sentence if we end up with strict liability, which I hope we will not. In the mean time, it will be interesting to hear from the Minister why this level of fine has been set. I beg to move.</p>

The logic of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is absolutely correct: until we have settled the issue of strict liability, it is probably not desirable to debate this matter at great length. We tabled our amendments on the premise that we had got rid of the idea of strict liability. There needs to be a tariff to reflect the seriousness of the offence, whereby the accused would be able to have a normal court hearing, a normal defence and, if found guilty, pay the sort of penalty that such an offence would merit. The main debate about the level of the offence would be better held on Report, when we have resolved the issue of strict liability.</p>

This issue was debated in another place, where, as here, it was linked with other amendments which sought to remove the strict liability element of the offence and to replace it with a requirement to prove that the defendant knew that he had been with a prostitute who had been subject to force or deception. These amendments are therefore based on the new mental element that, in the view of the Official Opposition, should be introduced into the offence, which is why they wish to increase the maximum penalty for such an offence.</p>

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09070174000097"></a>In the other place, it was also argued that the offence of having sex with someone who had been forced in some way was the equivalent of rape and should be treated as such. However, this offence is distinct from rape because there is no requirement to show that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the prostitute was threatened or deceived; hence, under strict liability we intend to give what we consider to be an appropriate penalty of a fine. That would be consistent with the penalties for similar offences, such as kerb-crawling, and in our view it would tackle the demand for prostitution. If someone has sex with a person who does not consent and they do not reasonably believe that that person has consented&#151;</p>

The cavalry also arrived in the person of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, who I know caught up a little with where we had got to in our debate and consulted the Minister and those in the Box. However, she is not in her place at the moment. Given what the Minister has said, it would probably be more constructive if I were to read <I>Hansard</I> and, between now and Report, see what the Minister comes back to us with. I hope that the Government will think about withdrawing the clause. They have heard from all Benches around the Committee the extreme disquiet that exists about this clause and at this point I do not think that it would be to the Committee&#146;s advantage if I were to extend the debate.</p>

Although I accept her proposal that we should look forward to some changes, together with the fact that we have discussed most of this issue, I should be very much happier if I were able briefly to put on the record some of the research findings on this matter. There have been moments when we have not seemed entirely clear what we are talking about when we have discussed the difference between people who have been forcibly trafficked and held against their will&#151;for example, in the sort of conditions suffered by the young woman from the Czech Republic, as described by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss&#151;and women who do not have British nationality, who are perhaps in London, either legally or illegally, and who have chosen to make their money by working in the sex industry rather than in some other low-paid job that might be available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09070174000103"></a>Therefore, I want briefly to put on the record the findings of the ESRC project on migrants in the UK sex industry. Those findings are to be published shortly and are based on in-depth interviews with 100 individuals without British nationality working in the sex industry in this country. The conclusions are that, for many of them, working in the sex industry is preferable to other very low-paid jobs that they might be able to do, mainly working in restaurants. Many of them are able to earn substantial amounts of money in this country, which helps them to keep their families alive in their own countries. In Soho, the noble Baroness,

It was clear that the amount of money that they could earn in the sex industry in Soho would make the standard of living of their families in the countries from which they came very much higher. That is an important point. All the people interviewed in this study felt that they were very vulnerable and that plans to criminalise sex work would make them more vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09070174000104"></a>Another piece of research, with which I am sure the Home Office is familiar, was carried out by Teela Sanders and Rosie Campbell. Their report, &#147;Designing out vulnerability, building in respect: violence, safety and sex work policy&#148;, is based on extensive fieldwork in two cities in the UK outside London. They make the point that the people most at risk of violence are those working on the street and that those working on the street are those who already come from backgrounds of violence and abuse. They also found that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070174000126"></a>&#147;zero tolerance style policing and policies against sex workers and men who buy sex&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09070174000111"></a>lead to an increase in violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09070174000105"></a>There is considerably more research available than that, but it seemed that it might be helpful to the Committee if some of the information were at least on the record so that we could be clear that it exists and that it is helpful to use research when it is available.</p>

The Government need to decide what they are doing with Clause 13. The problem is whether the Government are involved in supporting a crusade against prostitution or whether they are trying to define a particular aspect of an area that is difficult for us all to understand or accept. Are they going outside the normal areas of law and justice to pursue, or help to pursue, a campaign that we have identified today? I very much hope that we can have some discussions before coming back on Report, which is a long way off. It may be helpful to exchange views, but if we do not and things do not change, Clause 13 will receive a pretty rough ride when it reappears.</p>

I could make a long contribution but I take the point made by the noble Baronesses, Lady Miller and Lady Hanham, about returning to this on Report so that the Committee might make some progress. I shall therefore restrict my comments to saying that I acknowledge that some people freely choose to sell sex. I also know that many involved in prostitution have little choice about their involvement and would leave it if they could.

It would exempt children from the offence of loitering or soliciting for the purposes of prostitution. The Government have repeatedly stated that involving children in prostitution is a form of child abuse, so it would be regrettable if they did not abolish the power to prosecute a child over the age of 10 for offences under Section 1 of the Street Offences Act 1959, which the Bill amends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09070185000005"></a>We are not convinced by the Government&#146;s explanation of the continuing need for the criminalisation of children involved in prostitution. I shall give the Minister an example of that in a moment. That explanation is in direct opposition to the conclusions of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. In particular, we are not persuaded by the assertion that the criminal justice system may be needed to enable children to access support. The provision of revised guidance is insufficient

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09070185000006"></a>We certainly think that children and young people have the right to be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation, and we heard earlier from the right reverend Prelate about the sexualisation of children. We have heard several times in briefings about the increase in all forms of exploitation of children, paedophile rings and many worrying things. Surely the answer is not to leave the victims&#151;the children&#151;criminalised, which is what the Bill proposes.</p>

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09070185000007"></a>In 2005-06, Barnardo&#146;s sexual exploitation services worked with 2,148 young people aged between 12 and 24. Research undertaken in 2005 indicated that as many as 1,000 young people in London alone were at risk of, or involved in, exploitation. We accept that it is a big problem. Research shows that children likely to be most at risk of sexual exploitation are those who have had a disrupted family life, have been in care, which is certainly a risk, have had a history of abuse or disadvantage, or are runaways.</p>

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09070185000008"></a>The sexual exploitation of children takes many forms that may include formal prostitution, but it has only relatively recently been recognised that children and young people who would once have been referred to as child prostitutes should be seen and treated as abused children in need of care and protection. Our amendment seeks to build on that recognition by removing the fact that children can still be prosecuted. The Minister will say that the number of children aged under 18 who have been prosecuted under Section 1 of the Street Offences Act is extremely low&#151;just one prosecution and two cautions in 2005&#151;but that is an argument to remove it from the statute book. If it is not much used, but it still criminalises children for something when they should be seen as the victim, that is a stronger argument for removing it.</p>

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09070185000009"></a>Britain had an appalling report from UNICEF on the state of children in this country. We must constantly bear it in mind that we should be improving their position. When the Bill was discussed in the other place, the Minister, Alan Campbell, in refuting the idea of decriminalising under-18s, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070185000147"></a>&#147;decriminalising under-18s would risk sending out a message that we do not think it is acceptable for adults to be involved in street prostitution but that somehow it is acceptable for a child or young person to loiter or solicit for the purposes of prostitution. If one child is deterred from getting involved in prostitution because they would be at risk of breaking the law that would justify our position&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 19/5/09; col. 1414.]</ul>
<a name="90701-0010.htm_para11"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09070185000012"></a>We should be looking at much better ways of rehabilitation for such people or more diversionary ways to deal with the problem.

To make a child like that into a criminal strikes me as cruel in the extreme. Surely, it is a question of &#147;suffer little children&#148;.

There may be a paradox, in that to continue to bring the child into the criminal system sounds terrible, but it may result in benefits. There is not a great deal of advantage in pretending something that is not. The child concerned, who is loitering for prostitution, is a child prostitute&#151;although you may wish to label it something else. There may be advantages in continuing with the system so that help shall be given and the child shall be taken away from prostitution, but I am not sure that the amendment helps.</p>

The United Kingdom&#146;s human rights obligations make it absolutely clear that children who are involved in sexual exploitation should not be deemed as committing criminal acts.

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09070185000016"></a>There have been two arguments. The first is the one echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that there may be exceptional cases where criminal justice intervention is necessary to prevent a harmful situation and allow a child to access support. That was the point made by the Minister in the Public Bill Committee in the other place. Indeed, the Government have from time to time tried to assert that criminalising people is not a bad thing but a helpful way to get them access to the services that they need. As I understand it, that was the approach taken by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I oppose that position. It is important to state that criminalisation is not an acceptable way to help people. The Joint Committee on Human Rights stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="09070185000144"></a>&#147;We find it surprising that the Government proposes to rely on the criminal justice system to address institutional or individual failures within the services available to children and young people. It appears to us to be more appropriate to strengthen their duties and capabilities of children's services to respond to children involved in prostitution&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070185000135"></a>The confidence that the Government have in the benefits of criminalisation alarms me. Criminalisation gives people a criminal record, which limits their chances and choices for the rest of their lives. That is particularly important when we are talking about people aged under 18, who we hope will be able to live their lives without some things that they have done in their youth being held against them.</p>

<a name="90701-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09070185000017"></a>The second argument made by the Minister has already been referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller: that by decriminalising we shall be sending out a message that it is somehow acceptable. With enormous respect to the Minister who made that suggestion, that is an absurd misunderstanding of the nature of deterrence. The young people going into that form of exploitation are not asking themselves what is the law in this country regarding prostitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09070185000018"></a>Reference has been made to the work carried out by Barnardo's about sexually exploited young people. Its work found that young people are in prostitution because of a lack of choice, because they are socially, emotionally and economically vulnerable. They have been failed by services at an early stage in their lives. The key point is that Barnardo's list of effective work with those young people includes giving them attention. In the words of Barnardo's, they have few, if any, concerned attentive adults in their lives, so they are attracted by the attention that they get from the adults who then go on to exploit and abuse them. For all of us, that is a sad prospect and is illustrative of how inappropriate the Government's argument for retaining the criminalisation of such young people is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09070185000021"></a>These children come from broken families where there is violence. They are often homeless. They turn to drugs and shoplifting and enter prostitution. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, many of them have been in care. There is recent evidence that the sex industry has been targeting children leaving care, and who are then trafficked within our borders into the sex industry. If those children and young people go into prostitution, we as a society have let them down. We should be doing all that we can to protect them, not to criminalise them.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="09070185000145"></a>&#147;The State party should always consider, both in legislation and in practice, child victims of these criminal practices, including child prostitution, exclusively as victims in need of recovery and reintegration and not as offenders&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070185000136"></a>That is important because, if you treat them as offenders, you are likely to deter them from seeking assistance from the authorities, which plays into the hands of the abusers. Therefore it is essential that we do not criminalise them.</p>

It re-emphasises the fact that these are children that we, between us, have failed. They are victims. We have failed them either as parents, as carers, or as the state. As we know from plenty of evidence, it is those who have been in care who, alas, are most likely to end up in that situation. There is a lot more that we need to do, but one thing that we do not need to do is give them a criminal record. It makes every sense that there is no criminalisation, no offence to be committed for those aged under 18. That is how the Government should go forward. There is plenty more we can do. I thought the point about the need to have someone to take an interest in the child&#151;literally, somebody to love; it is as simple as that&#151;is important. We should be finding mentors to point out to them other ways of developing their lives from then onwards. I support the amendment.</p>

The amendment changes the law so that children cannot be prosecuted for the offence of loitering and soliciting. It clearly concerns not only the noble Baroness but a number of noble Lords and many people outside this House. Many favour changing the law in the way suggested in the amendment. We take seriously the concerns of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and children&#146;s organisations, among others, who argue for decriminalising children in relation to this offence. We have considered this matter fully and taken account of the full range of views. Having done so, on balance, we have decided to retain the current law.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09070185000025"></a>I should start by emphasising that we accept the principle that children who become involved in prostitution are victims of a sexual offence and should be offered appropriate support. We set out our approach in our guidance <I>Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution</I>, which was originally issued in 2000, and we maintain that position in the latest version of the guidance, which was published earlier this month. As a consequence of this guidance and the approach it sets out, this offence is used against children very rarely. Between 2004 and 2007, a period of four years, five convictions and five cautions were given to under-18s for this offence. The noble Baroness said that in 2000, the latest year for which statistics are available, there was one conviction and two cautions. My brief states that there was one conviction and one caution. It is clear that, in practice, this offence is used extremely rarely in relation to under-18s. In the overwhelming majority of cases, they are treated solely as victims of a crime.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09070185000026"></a>Nevertheless, we believe there are reasons in favour of retaining this offence. Alan Campbell, the Minister in the other place who has been cited, made the point  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_286"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that decriminalising under-18s could risk sending out a message that we do not think it is acceptable for adults to be involved in street prostitution, but we consider it acceptable for a child or young person to loiter or solicit for the purposes of prostitution. Retaining the offence may therefore deter some children from engaging in street prostitution in the first place. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, spoke about children being targeted on leaving care. One of the things we are concerned about is that abolishing the offence would risk encouraging pimps to target those children in order to take advantage of the fact that children engaged in prostitution could not be arrested by police if they were found loitering or soliciting.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09070185000027"></a>Noble Baronesses made the point that in exceptional cases support from other agencies has been made available but has not been accessed or has not been effective in helping the child exit street prostitution. In some cases, we believe the intervention of the criminal justice agencies may be vital in ensuring the removal of that child or young person from a situation of danger and initiating engagement with support services. It may be that this intervention is the most effective in leading the child to engage with the appropriate support agencies, given the failure. It is not necessarily failure on the part of the agencies; it may simply be that the child has decided that it does not want to co-operate. This is an opportunity to give a boost to the rehabilitation that we are seeking to achieve with the new rehabilitation penalties that we are creating in Clause 16.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said that we have corporate responsibility, as I would call it, for these children. Given the fine balance that the Minister mentioned, I am surprised that he has continued to come down on the side of retaining this provision. I was given some hope when I read the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, who was looking at this issue from the point of view of the Department for Children, Schools and Families when giving evidence to the Bill Committee in the other place. She agreed that a child prostitute is a victim, not a criminal.

It is not surprising that they end up on the street. If they do not want to be put straight back into care, and there are often substantial reasons why they have run away from home or care, they have no hostels. Just 56 beds is underprovision of an enormous sort, so runaways are already more vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09070185000035"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that some non-resident parents are determined not to accept financial responsibility for their children. Unfortunately, they demonstrate this by failing to pay their child maintenance and building up arrears. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission already has a number of tools it can use to enforce payment when this happens. For example, it can use a deduction from earnings order, which is an effective method of collecting both ongoing liabilities and arrears in many cases. However, in some cases, a deduction from earnings order cannot be used or is ineffective; for example, because the non-resident parent is self-employed or frequently changes jobs. The Government want the commission to be able to take quick and effective action to enforce payment of child maintenance in all cases where a non-resident parent is failing to comply. With this is mind, we set  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_288"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out our proposals for tougher enforcement in our White Paper, <I>A New System of Child Maintenance</I><I>,</I> in December 2006.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09070185000036"></a>Subsequently, the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 inserted powers into the Child Support Act 1991 which would allow the commission to use deduction orders to collect child maintenance from an account held by a non-resident parent with a deposit-taker or from funds held by a third party. Because deduction orders will be administrative they can be made without going to court first and can therefore get money flowing for children more quickly. They will provide an additional tool that can be used alongside existing methods of collection and enforcement.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09070185000037"></a>The regulations before us today will implement the powers taken to enable both regular and lump-sum deduction orders to be used on accounts held by deposit takers, which will normally be banks or building societies. These regulations do not make provision for deduction orders to be used on funds held by third parties, such as solicitors. The commission has decided to use deduction orders on bank and building society accounts first because it believes that orders on these accounts have the greater potential for collecting child maintenance. The regulations have therefore been developed in close consultation with representatives from the banking sector which will be responsible for operating the orders. The commission will go on to assess the scope for further regulations which will enable it to use lump-sum deduction orders on funds held by third parties. This will involve working with a number of stakeholders, including solicitors and other government departments.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09070185000038"></a>I should make it clear that, where there are arrears of child maintenance, the commission will do all it can to make an arrangement with the non-resident parent to pay those arrears before a deduction order is made. The commission would much prefer child maintenance to be paid, for example, by direct debit, which will not incur any additional charge for the non-resident parent and is much easier and cheaper for both the commission and the deposit-taker to administer. However, if the non-resident parent fails to make a satisfactory arrangement to pay, the commission will use what information it has to first liaise with deposit-takers in order to identify a suitable account on which to make an order. In doing so, the commission will ensure that it does not make an order on an account which is specifically excluded by the regulations. This would apply where, for example, the non-resident parent has no beneficial interest in any of the funds in it because they are operating it solely as a trustee.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09070185000039"></a>The regulations also prevent the commission from making a lump sum deduction order on an account which is used wholly or in part for business purposes. However, it may make a regular deduction order on such an account, but only where it is used by the non-resident parent as a sole trader. If the Commission decides to make a regular deduction order, the deposit-taker will be required to deduct regular amounts of ongoing maintenance and/or arrears from the non-resident parent&#146;s account. The commission will send a copy of the regular deduction order to the deposit-taker, specifying details of the account, the amount, the dates on which  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_289"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deductions are to be made and when it will take effect. A copy of the order will also be sent to the non-resident parent. The deposit-taker will have a legal duty to make deductions from the account specified in the order and pay the relevant amount to the commission. The deposit-taker will also be able to deduct an amount up to a maximum of &#163;10 towards its administrative costs before making each deduction. This takes account of the fact that deposit-takers will be required to process deduction orders manually because they operate differently from direct debits and standing orders and cannot be automated.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09070185000040"></a>Safeguards will be in place to protect both the non-resident parent and the deposit-taker. The amount of each deduction will not exceed 40 per cent of the net weekly income used in the current maintenance calculation, and the deposit-taker must not deduct an amount that will put the account into overdraft. The regulations also set out clearly the circumstances where either the non-resident parent or the deposit-taker can apply for a review of a regular deduction order. This includes, for example, where there has been a change in the amount of the maintenance calculation in question or an incorrect amount has been specified in the order due to an error. Both the non-resident parent and the deposit-taker will have a right of appeal to a county court&#151;or sheriff in Scotland&#151;against the making of the order and against a decision following an application to review the order. If the commission decides to make a lump-sum deduction order the deposit-taker will be required to deduct a lump sum from the non-resident parent&#146;s account in respect of a specified amount of arrears. The order will operate in a similar way to a third-party debt order from a court but, because it is administrative, the process will be quicker.</p>

The commission will initially send the deposit-taker and the non-resident parent a copy of an interim order which will specify details of the account and the arrears to be collected by a final order. The interim order will also instruct the deposit-taker to freeze up to the amount specified in the order. Both the non-resident parent and the deposit-taker will have 14 days to make representations to the commission against the proposals in the interim order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09070185000042"></a>At any point throughout the process, from receipt of the interim order until the funds are paid to the commission, both the non-resident parent and the deposit-taker may apply to the commission for consent to release some or all of the funds from the account. The non-resident parent might do this where, for example, there is an existing written contractual obligation to make a payment to another party. The deposit-taker might do it where, for example, it already has a written agreement with the account holder that a specific amount in the account is held as security against a loan.</p>

The commission will not make a final order until the time allowed for an appeal, 21 days, is passed and will not instruct the deposit-taker to transfer funds until any appeal against the making of the final order is resolved. The deposit-taker will have a legal duty to comply with the requirements of the order and pay the specified amount to the commission. The deposit-taker may also take up to a maximum of &#163;55 towards its administrative costs before making the payment to the commission. This aligns with the amount a deposit-taker can currently take for administering a third-party debt order made by a court which requires deposit-takers to follow a similar process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09070185000044"></a>Noble Lords should be aware that the new powers inserted into the 1991 Act made provision for regulations to allow both regular and lump-sum deduction orders to be made on a joint account. However, these regulations do not include such provisions. We recognise that these new powers are unprecedented and, therefore, the commission will use them carefully, particularly on initial implementation. That is why the safeguards are built into the process. It is also why the commission is planning to start to introduce deduction orders using a small dedicated team so that implementation will be at a low volume and controlled.</p>

<a name="90701-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09070185000045"></a>The impact assessment, which was published alongside the draft regulations, says that this policy will be fully evaluated by the commission in September 2010. If that evaluation finds evidence that excluding joint accounts from the scope of deduction orders is reducing their effectiveness, we will introduce further regulations to extend provisions so that orders can be made on joint accounts. The evaluation will also enable the commission to collect information which will allow it to assess the potential for and likely benefits of increasing the number of deduction orders made in the future. In the mean time, the provisions in these regulations will enable the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to start to use deduction orders both as an additional enforcement tool and as a means of encouraging ongoing compliance.</p>

Perhaps the most significant move is to put for the first time into law the power to access directly a citizen&#146;s bank account and to remove money to give it to that person&#146;s child or children. I think I understand the process by which accounts of individuals and sole traders will be accessed, but not individuals trading as companies and partnerships, or anyone with joint accounts. Does not the Minister expect that this loophole&#151;or gaping chasm, one might think&#151;will be quickly discovered and that partners will soon be appearing on bank accounts to render them out of reach? I understand that accounts held on behalf of clients by solicitors are also protected. The rationale may be right but it is another way out for recalcitrant parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09070185000052"></a>I hope that the Minister will endeavour to address my concerns. If they are not covered in his response, perhaps he will give noble Lords the answers in writing. He might also tell noble Lords how the review promised for 2010 will be analysed, shared and debated. At the beginning of my remarks I indicated my support for these regulations. I hope that the Government have got it right and that a future Government will not be forced to return to this issue.</p>

I am happy to concur with him that these orders should proceed. In his very important penultimate point, he asked what would happen with regard to the 2010 CMEC review. I certainly hope that it will be published. It is very important to debate these powers, particularly in the early years as we see how they pan out in practice. The commission should understand that Parliament does not provide administrative powers of this kind&#151;I think that the Minister mentioned unprecedented powers&#151;lightly. We will be watching very closely to see how they work and whether they achieve the policy aim and are used in a fit and proper manner, as was intended in Sections 22 and 23 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008. I concur that the House will want to keep a watching brief as these regulations start to be implemented.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09070185000054"></a>I remember vividly the good debates that we had when discussing Clauses 22 and 23 of the 2008 Bill, as it then was. I was very clear in my own mind that these powers were required for self-employed people. Non-resident parents who are subject to contracts of employment are much easier to handle if they are acting in bad faith in seeking to elide payments for their children. Deduction of earnings orders are a far easier, simpler, better understood and better controlled  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_292"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process. The evidence that was laid before the House last year certainly convinced me that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission required specific powers where self-employed people were involved, as the quantification of where the money and the assets were was very much harder to ascertain and took time to establish. The people who suffer most as a result of that are the children who do not get the money to which they are entitled under the legislation.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09070185000055"></a>Self-employed cases represent only 8 per cent of the caseload. I have studied this matter since 1991. I keep saying that I have no alibi. I was there at the time and I feel deeply responsible for the legislation, which has been so fraught in its many manifestations. However, that percentage represents 96,000 self-employed, non-resident parents with liability outstanding. That is a big caseload which needs to be dealt with. I hope that these powers will be used proportionately. I agree that they are necessary but they must be used very carefully indeed. Non-resident parents who are in the sights of the commission using these new administrative procedures need to understand clearly what is facing them before it is safe to use these powers. In that regard I do not think that sending a copy of the interim order to the deposit holder does that by itself. The Minister may say that there will be a letter. It may be only one page of A4 but it needs to make crystal clear that the new system will be different. These parents may have struggled with the old CSA, now CMEC, for years. Indeed, a lot of them have. Some of them have acted in worse faith than others, but this is a different procedure altogether. Simply providing a photocopy of a legal document, which is probably quite impenetrable to people who are untutored in these things, is not sufficient in my view unless it is accompanied by something which explains in plain Queen&#146;s English what is now facing the people against whom these powers will be arraigned.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09070185000056"></a>I also think that the accuracy of the system&#151;I want to come back to this in a minute&#151;still leaves a lot to be desired. I have real fears that although most of these orders will be used against people who deserve to have them imposed, some who do not fall into that category may get caught up in these provisions. Therefore, we need to be careful to make the system as accurate as possible. The Minister said that these unprecedented powers need to be used with care. I say amen to that. I like to think that they will be used only as a last resort; that is, when there is no other way to get the non-resident parent to face up to his or her responsibilities. Establishing a case against any such non-resident parent who is the subject of these orders must be done to the same standards that are used in assessing court cases under the current system. As I am sure noble Lords will know as we discussed this when the 2008 Bill was going through, at the moment the commission has powers to go to the court. My clear understanding was that very special care would rightly be taken before any case was taken to the court by the commission. I would not like to think that just because we were slipping into an administrative route rather than a judicial route the standards would be any less rigorous in terms of getting the evidence, presenting it clearly and making sure that the case against the non-resident parent was just and merited the use of these powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09070185000057"></a>I would also like to think that very clear guidance will be given to staff. The impact assessment tells us that 11 staff will be given three days&#146; training. I am a bit concerned about that. If they start to handle 500 cases a month, as the impact assessment statement tells us, I am not certain that they will have the capacity to be able to do that safely. I hope that the Minister, on behalf of the House, will satisfy himself that the guidance and training that these staff will get is fit for the purpose for which it is being given.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09070185000058"></a>I also note an increasing use by CMEC of ordinary bailiffs rather than court bailiffs, which concerns me. There are some safeguards in using bailiffs who are part and parcel of magistrates&#146; courts and the sheriff court system in Scotland. Just using a centralised system of bailiffs means that the same care in how some of these orders are prosecuted might not be guaranteed.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09070185000059"></a>Perhaps the Minister would prefer to write to me on this judicial point. I understand that, under the Court of Appeal case of Rowley v the Secretary of State for the Department for Work and Pensions, there is no right of compensation for an action when an administrative procedure of this kind is used as opposed to any other kind of procedure. It would be helpful if the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, anyone else who is interested in this debate and I could be reassured about that important point.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09070185000060"></a>There is also a feeling that the recovery process is mechanical&#151;that it is a steamroller operating automatically. Once the initial series of appeals, reviews and the rest of it are over and it is in the statutory recovery process, there is no avenue for anyone to consider again whether the amount of debt due or the liability is right or whether the assessments have been conducted properly. I have some concerns about that. Noble Lords will know that there is now a welcome introduction to things like the so-called options service, which sometimes give the possibility of a face-to-face interview. More than anything else, people who are subject to this statutory machine for recovery of debt feel that they do not have a chance for someone to listen to their case. I notice that DWP report 503 on relationships, separation and divorce, by NatCen and co-authored by Professor Nick Wikeley and others, found the pursuit of debt to be a remote processing system. If we are using this new administrative heavyweight machinery and there is some evidence that there is a remoteness in the processing system, there is a potential flaw that some people could fall through some of the systems and get hurt in a way that is disproportionate to the liabilities that they were allowed to owe.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09070185000061"></a>Accuracy continues to concern me about the whole operation of the CMEC proposal. Will the Minister ask the department to get the commission to explain how the accuracy figures are supposed to work? I have studied them for some time. The latest figures, for March 2009, show that on the basis of the &#147;right to the nearest penny&#148; test&#151;I do not understand how that test is conceived and put together&#151;84 per cent of the current system was right to the nearest penny, as was  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>91 per cent of the old system. That does not equate or relate to the evidence on the ground of people saying that their assessments are inaccurate. On the so-called &#147;cash value&#148; accuracy test in the March 2009 figures, 96 per cent of the current system is said to be accurate in terms of its cash value and 98 per cent of the old system is supposed to be accurate. These data are impossible to fathom. I can make no sense of them because they are meaningless. The Minister is careful about these things. Perhaps he will go back and try to make sense of these figures. A letter to explain what is going on to me and, possibly, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, would be very welcome.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09070185000062"></a>As far as I can see, the last CSA standards report was published in 2003-04. It said that 65 per cent of liability orders were wrong. That was some time ago and I know that there have been improvements, but 65 per cent of liabilities being inaccurate is not a strong base on which to start using administrative powers of this kind. I think that the Minister will continue to take an interest in accuracy.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09070185000063"></a>I think that just short of &#163;4 billion of debt is still to be collected; we will not know until the commission&#146;s next annual report is published. It would be helpful if the Minister could say when that is likely to be. In the past, annual reports of the commission and the CSA have slipped by sometimes for not weeks but months. I just hope that we will get the annual report in July as expected. Only then will we be able to discover what the trends and the outstanding debts are. Knowing when the annual report is to be published would be useful information which might reassure some of us.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09070185000064"></a>In addition to that, the commission has commissioned two reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers. One report is on the age of outstanding debt and the other is about collectivity of the debt. I hope that by now they have been received by the commission. If they have, I trust that they will be published. I hope that the Minister will insist that they are published so that we can all look at the exact trends in relation to the debt.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09070185000065"></a>Finally, the Minister said something about the appeal process which caused a question mark to appear in my mind. I understand perfectly that the Explanatory Memorandum says that there will be an appeal process, which is welcome so far as it goes. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the appeal process is only about the correctness or otherwise of the laying of the order to the deposit taker. I do not think that it is about the merits of the liable debt. If an appeal is lodged within the 21-day period, can the non-resident parent then say, &#147;Well, I am appealing not because the order has been laid incorrectly to the wrong bank, for the wrong reason or for the wrong amount, but because I cannot afford to pay this because it will affect my second family&#148;? Does the appeal process stretch to a non-resident parent being able to appear in court and say, &#147;Well, actually I do owe X thousand pounds, but for the following 16 reasons I can only afford to pay it back at a reduced rate other than that in the draft order which has been served on me&#148;? If that is true, it would obviously encourage a great many non-resident parents to avail themselves of that appeal. Allegedly, in many cases, some of them have been trying to establish that for a long time.</p>

I hope that they will be used carefully and as a last resort. I hope that they achieve the &#163;2.1 million that they are set to try to recover for children. That is an ambitious target and I will be very surprised if it is reached. But in a year&#146;s time, come 2010, whenever the commission reviews the success or otherwise of these orders, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and I, and no doubt other Members of the House, will want to continue to have this discussion to make sure that the orders are being used efficiently and successfully, and to the benefit of the children who, ultimately, are those we are most concerned about.</p>

That was the tenor of the debate. Perhaps I may start with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, about the number of children who have been supported by the current system, which was the thrust of his question. It is estimated that around 250,000 of the current caseload are not compliant, but looking at the performance over the years and the number of children who are benefiting, as of March 2008, we see that some 749,000 children have benefited from the CSA&#146;s efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09070185000068"></a>Going back to March 2005, the figure was 561,000. Thus the numbers have risen from 561,000 to 623,000 to 740,000 at March 2008, and to a provisional figure based on internal calculations about the impact, post the removal of Section 6 compulsion, of 810,000 at March 2009.</p>

That presents a different side of the equation. If the figures are not to hand, I am quite happy for the Minister to write to me.</p>

Some may have been outside the statutory system for a long period while others may be newly outside it once the Section 6 compulsion has been removed. In terms of the amount of maintenance collected, in the period to March 2009 it was &#163;1.1 billion, up from &#163;798 million in March 2005, so more money is flowing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09070185000071"></a>Both noble Lords referred to the nature of the accounts we are seeking to reach with these orders. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that if they will not facilitate access to joint or third party accounts, that is an obvious loophole, and indeed the same point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. I remember the debates we had on this when we considered the Bill last year. As I said when presenting the order, we are focusing on the accounts that we have identified because  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_296"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we believe they are the most fruitful ones from which to garner resources for children, but if our review shows that the potential loophole is being exploited, obviously we have primary powers to address it, and we would do that. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, made the point that this is really about self-employed people, and he is absolutely right that deductions from earnings orders almost by definition cannot apply if someone does not have earnings in terms of a salary or a wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09070185000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about the administration fee. It is set down in regulations and is the sum that will be levied by the deposit-takers for providing their services. Both noble Lords raised issues around the review. If that review leads to the need for further legislation, clearly there will be a consultation exercise and, quite properly, there will be debates in Parliament, particularly when regulations are brought forward. In terms of publishing the impact of that, I am sure that there will be one means or another by which that can happen. Noble Lords are thoroughly adept at securing debates on these issues whether there is a formal Motion before the House or not, and it is important that such debates should take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09070185000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred to the training that was identified in the documentation. I should stress that at the start we are approaching this in a fairly low-key way to make sure that it works properly. I think that a figure of 140 cases per month was mentioned in the impact assessment, but the commission has developed specialist training in conjunction with officials with expertise in the policy. They developed the process with the bank section and detailed guidance is already available to deposit-takers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09070185000076"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, also said he thought that the commission was not being heavy-handed in its collection processes and that the deduction orders would be a kind of last resort. They will not be in all cases. As I said, we would seek to go down this path only if other mechanisms for trying to encourage non-resident parents to pay proved to be unsuccessful. The arrangements that are currently available to the original Child Support Agency and now the commission comprise deduction from earnings orders, liability orders, bailiffs, third-party debt orders, charges on property, orders for the sale of property, driving licence disqualification and imprisonment. Indeed, in the 12 months to the end of January 2009, a total of 120,970 enforcement actions were carried out. The  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_297"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>most recent enforcement figure includes 30 non-resident parents receiving prison sentences, 510 receiving suspended prison sentences, 30 non-resident parents receiving suspended driving licence disqualifications and five being disqualified from driving. We do not apologise for that because it is right that the commission should be tough on those who simply refuse to pay. Indeed, we will have a debate tomorrow during our consideration of the Welfare Reform Bill on further measures set out in that legislation so that we are able to reach those people who will do everything they possibly can to avoid meeting their obligations to their children. It is shocking that this needs to be done, but it is only right that we pursue it. Reverting to the discussion we have just had, I am advised that the noble Lord is right. Some 500 cases per month are dealt with and 140 cases end in deduction, which I believe is the point he sought to press.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09070185000077"></a>On the appeal process, an appeal against the calculation may be made to a tribunal. The grounds for appeal against a lump sum deduction order show that the regulations do not actually restrict the grounds for appeal. For example, an appeal may be made where it appears that the amount set out in the lump sum deduction order is wrong or the liable person considers that a reasonable arrangement to pay has been reached. An appeal may also be made to follow on the commission&#146;s refusal to consent to release frozen funds. However, the circumstances where the commission may give such consent are set out in the regulations and therefore it is implicit that a court would consider a repeal against the commission&#146;s refusal to release funds only if it related to any of those circumstances.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09070185000078"></a>On the grounds for appeal against a regular deduction order, the regulations again do not restrict these grounds. For example, an appeal may be made that the amount of the regular deduction order is wrong or the liable person considers that a reasonable arrangement has been made to pay the arrears again, and it may also be made against any decision following an application for a review of a regular deduction order. In these circumstances it is implicit that the court would consider the appeal only if it related to the circumstances in which an application review can be made as set out in the regulations.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09070185000079"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, sought an assurance that these powers will be used proportionately. Deduction orders will be used only where there are arrears of child maintenance. As I said earlier, the commission will provide the non-resident parent with every opportunity to pay before a deduction order is considered, and there is the right to seek a review. The noble Lord asked for an update on the figures for the age and collection of debt, and I am certainly happy to write to him to ensure that he gets the most recent data we have. He also referred to issues around accuracy. That has been a long-standing challenge for the commission, but the data show that there has been continuing improvement, and certainly the operational improvement plan made a significant step change to the operation of the then agency and now the commission.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09070185000080"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about the Rowley case. I shall get an update on that and make sure that he receives it. He referred to child maintenance  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and options. That is what we used to refer to as the information and support service when we were debating the Bill. The thrust of that service is to support particularly those parents who were forced to use the statutory system because that is what the legislation required, and to encourage people, again as we debated in the Bill, to seek to make their own arrangements outside the statutory system. It is really focused on that.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09070185000081"></a>I have some data about the extent to which the option service has been used. Since the repeal of Section 6 of the Child Support Act, which, as I said, previously compelled people on benefits to use the Child Support Agency, approximately 260,000 parents with a child maintenance interest have made benefit claims through Jobcentre Plus. All these have been offered support from child maintenance options, with approximately 110,000 accepting the support and 150,000 choosing to decline it. The proportion choosing to accept a referral to options has risen since the launch of the service and currently around 50 per cent of the offers are being accepted. I hope that gives the noble Lord a measure of where we are on that service.</p>

<a name="90701-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09070185000082"></a>I hope I have answered the points that each noble Lord was pressing; I am happy to come back if they think I have not. I have committed to write to noble Lords on a couple of points and I am happy to do that. However, if there is nothing further, I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

In December 2007, we announced a significant extension to the FAS, key elements of which have already been implemented. During February and March this year, the Government consulted on a set of draft regulations that implement further elements of the 2007 announcement and make changes to the administration of the FAS. I now bring these draft regulations before the House.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09070185000084"></a>The draft regulations make a number of changes to both the structure of the assistance and the administration of the FAS. They will allow for the FAS to acknowledge where schemes had made provision to pay what used to be called an unmarried partner; that is, someone who while not married to the member&#151;or now not in  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a civil partnership with them&#151;was living with the member on the same basis. In order to qualify, the surviving partner must have been living with the deceased member before they died and be either nominated by the member or prove financial dependency or interdependency. Where the deceased member left both a spouse and a partner, the partner will be paid and not the spouse where, and only where, the member had nominated that partner.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09070185000085"></a>The draft regulations will also allow for payments to be made to certain children and young adults who were financially dependent on the deceased member. Such payments continue up to the age of 16 and may continue to age 23 where the child remains in education or cannot work full time due to a disability.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09070185000086"></a>On 1 January each year, assistance in payment, which relates to scheme rights accrued after April 1997, will be increased. That increase will be in line with the retail prices index up to a maximum of 2.5 per cent. If the retail prices index goes down or is at 0 per cent, there will be no increase applied for that year but the amount in payment will not be reduced.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09070185000087"></a>Assistance is payable from the qualifying member&#146;s normal retirement age. However, we are aware that some people may have accrued rights in their scheme to a different age&#151;for instance, when a scheme changes its normal retirement age and someone is a member both before and after that date. These draft regulations will take this into account. Where their normal retirement age is after the date to which a part of their pension has accrued, that part of the expected pension will be actuarially uplifted. Where the normal retirement age falls before the date to which a part of their pension has accrued, that part of the expected pension will be actuarially reduced.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09070185000088"></a>Currently, assistance tops up the pension provided by the scheme to 90 per cent of the person&#146;s expected pension. The cap ensures that, where 90 per cent is higher than &#163;26,000, assistance is limited so that the individual gets from the scheme and the FAS in total no more than that amount. These draft regulations will allow the &#163;26,000 announced in March 2007 to increase annually in line with the retail prices index from April 2007, ensuring that the cap keeps pace with inflation. For anyone who was entitled to assistance from April 2007, the cap will be increased to &#163;26,936. These are significant improvements in the structure of assistance payments and I hope that noble Lords will welcome them.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09070185000089"></a>I will now cover certain issues which we need to address in the context of delivering these changes but which were not part of the 2007 announcement. First, there are schemes that paid what is known as a bridging pension. The commonest example is where a man retires at age 60 with a scheme pension that goes down at age 65 when his state pension begins. Some schemes, when buying the annuity, have flattened this bridge, if I may put it in that way, so that the annuity pays out the same amount over the person&#146;s lifetime. However, we have been made aware that other schemes have bought annuities with the bridge intact. These regulations allow for assistance to mirror the annuity: where it has smoothed the reduction over the individual&#146;s lifetime,  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_300"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the assistance will do the same; where the annuity retains the bridge, the assistance will reduce when the annuity goes down.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09070185000090"></a>At present, the FAS takes no account of any increases in the scheme pension once assistance begins. When we decided to provide indexation on assistance, this oddity had to be corrected. Paying indexation in respect of the assistance only would mean those with a flat-rate pension getting less of an increase in total than someone whose scheme paid nothing. Therefore, the amount of pension brought to account in the assistance calculation will be the amount actually in payment, and any subsequent increase in the pension will also be brought to account.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09070185000091"></a>The issue of taking account of payments made before the final entitlement is calculated also needs to be addressed. It can take a scheme some time to decide what it can pay a member from its remaining assets; until then, the scheme and the FAS can make payments on account of entitlement. Because the scheme normally pays an amount that it is reasonably sure is lower than the final amount, assistance may have been overpaid before the correct amount has been established. These regulations allow scheme payments to be brought to account when the final rate of assistance is being calculated. This means that, over the individual&#146;s lifetime, the correct level of payments will be made.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09070185000092"></a>The changes that I have described will apply in relation to a person&#146;s entire period of entitlement to FAS payments. Many individuals already being paid now will find that their entitlement increases and, where this happens, they will be given payments for past periods. However, the way in which the various changes interact means that it is possible that in some cases entitlement goes down. Where this occurs and someone&#146;s finalised entitlement had previously been determined, the current amount will remain in payment. This protection will also apply where a person&#146;s initial payments have previously been protected. However, these arrangements will not apply to any other initial payment calculations. Secondly, protection will, in some cases, exist only for a limited period. In some cases, standard entitlement could go up&#151;for instance, because of indexation&#151;and this could result in that entitlement becoming higher than the protected amount. Where that happens, the higher amount will be paid.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09070185000093"></a>These changes will require the FAS to collect different information, and these regulations make the necessary changes to the information regulations. They also make changes to the review and appeal regulations to allow for decisions to be challenged in these areas. Trustees will also be required to supply more details about the scheme and its expenditure&#151;for example, information on current or contemplated legal proceedings&#151;and to notify the FAS of any contemplated significant changes in the investment of the scheme&#146;s assets.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09070185000094"></a>I come now to operational changes. At present the FAS is administered&#151;very well, I suggest&#151;by DWP staff. However, the FAS will be undertaking broadly similar functions to those currently undertaken by the board of the Pension Protection Fund. It therefore seemed appropriate to have both systems managed by the PPF. These draft regulations confer the responsibility  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_301"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of managing the FAS on to the board of the PPF. Current FAS staff will be seconded for a temporary period to the board to provide continuity. The Government will continue to fully fund the FAS, none of whose costs will fall on the PPF levy payer.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09070185000095"></a>This change requires certain other changes. These will allow the DWP to pay the board for its FAS-related work, allow the board to delegate its FAS work to its own staff and some of its work to a commercial provider, and give these people access to relevant DWP information. In addition, the board will have discretion to make payments to schemes in certain circumstances&#151;for instance, where the scheme has run out of money and is unable to complete wind-up. The draft regulations also make certain minor changes that the experience of the FAS staff has shown would be helpful, such as allowing payments for periods other than monthly.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09070185000096"></a>I shall revert to one matter that I have mentioned: I said that the payment for surviving children and young adults would be paid until age 16 unless the child had a disability or was in education. In fact, payments are made up to age 18 unless the child has a disability or is in education, in which case payment can continue until the age of 23.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09070185000097"></a>Noble Lords have been very patient with me during what has been quite a technical explanation. The changes in the draft regulations offer significant improvements for many FAS members. In my view, these draft regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and I commend them to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09070185000099"></a>The consultation process earlier this year on these regulations was interesting. I understand that there were 148 respondents on the DWP website. Many individuals did not respond to the specific proposals but instead expressed their disagreement with the content of the Government&#146;s announcement of December 2007. Does the Minister feel that the Government have done enough to adequately explain the proposal to those affected?</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09070185000100"></a>Of course, the Minister will be only too aware that the December 2007 announcement was consequent on the Young review, which was set up as a direct consequence of the Government sinking our lifeboat proposals in another place. The scheme at the time was bogged down and potential beneficiaries were denied access to those pensions to which they believed themselves entitled. The Minister will be aware that some died before receiving any money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09070185000101"></a>We note that these regulations bring into effect what we hope will be the last phase in the changes to the management of the scheme, making the board of the Pension Protection Fund the scheme manager.

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09070185000102"></a>We have repeatedly told the Government that they have failed properly to address the pension time bomb. The danger is of two-tier pension provision with unfunded public sector pensions paid for by taxpayers in the private sector, whose pensions face a continuing underfunding crisis. These regulations are hardly a brick in the wall of &#147;Building Britain&#146;s Future&#148;. It is a future that looks increasingly bleak for many until we have a Government who can come clean about public finances and tell the truth about government spending plans.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09070185000103"></a>From the moment of Gordon Brown&#146;s first Budget, removing &#163;5 billion a year in advance corporation tax, amounting to some &#163;150 billion in total removed from private sector pension funds, he has mismanaged the pensions issue and let people down. If these regulations make some recompense, they are to be welcomed. Can the Minister give that assurance?</p>

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="09070185000104"></a><b><a name="90701-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070185000191"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, I am happy to follow the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, again. I welcome these regulations. The Minister is right to be careful in the way in which he explains the changes from the Dispatch Box; although the regulations are technical, they have a dramatic effect on some of the pensions to which they relate.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09070185000105"></a>The scheme that the Government laid out in December 2007 has been improved and these regulations improve it further, which is welcome. The consultation referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was interesting, though; most people ended up by simply complaining that the Government had not gone far enough fast enough. Maybe that is why the consultation lasted only for six weeks, not 12; maybe the Government just thought that they would get another dose of the same if they continued the consultation for the usual period.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09070185000106"></a>I hope that the upcoming so-called &#147;winter package&#148; regulations that remain to complete this December 2007 reform will have a proper consultation attached to them and that it will take 12 weeks. One of the things that should be canvassed in the course of that consultation period is the extent to which the Government may in future be prepared to look again at the generosity or otherwise of the totality of the scheme. It is obviously an improvement and it is welcome so far as it goes, but only when the Government take the transfer assets into their control will they be able to get a proper handle on exactly what the fund has available to it. At that point, they could consider the possibility of doing even better. Although the scheme is welcome and generous so far as it goes, it does not deal with the issue to the extent that some of the people who are affected by these defaults and company collapses would like to see. We must keep that point of view at the front of our mind in considering these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09070185000107"></a>I would like to mention two other operational matters. There is some concern that, if the board of the Pension Protection Fund is managing these provisions, there needs to be a clear separation of responsibilities, particularly in relation to costs. I hope that the Minister will keep an eye on that. I think that this potential concern is understood, but I hope that it will be at the forefront of his mind as these matters are taken forward.</p>

Targets to avoid undue delays are important and I encourage the Minister and the department, in introducing these regulations, to make sure that undue delay is avoided if at all possible.</p>

Let me start with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, about keeping the door open to changing or improving the settlement that was reached. The Government made it clear in 2007 that we considered that the revised scheme represented a generous and appropriate final settlement. We are satisfied that we are complying with our EU obligations in that regard. The net present value of the schemes taking account of these regulations is something like &#163;3.5 billion&#151;a not insignificant cost. The scheme is estimated to help and provide assistance to something like 140,000 individuals. As at 22 June, it had already paid some &#163;64 million to some 12,000 members. A lot of work is going on; this is a very significant scheme. When the Government have completed it&#151;there is one more set of regulations to come&#151;we will actually have done more than we committed to doing in December 2007, particularly with regard to severe ill health.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09070185000111"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that of course there are people who are not satisfied with this. One can understand it&#151;they lost the expectation of a full pension and did not get it replicated in every detail. I acknowledge that that is concerning for them, but there has to be a balance. We never said that FAS or indeed PPF arrangements would replicate what individual schemes would otherwise have provided.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09070185000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, gave us a mini-version of the Conservative tirade about pensioner apartheid. Let me be very clear: anybody who has analysed the evidence will see what is happening to defined benefit schemes and what has happened to pension provision in recent years. We know that longevity is increasing. For a long time, actuaries did not wake up sufficiently to what was happening to returns on asset values; they were overstated and it was assumed that they would remain that way for a long time. The noble Lord&#146;s Government&#146;s legislation on pensions in a sense forced pension holidays because it limited the extent of surpluses that could be left in funds. The repayable tax credit was part of a restructuring of the corporation tax system which was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. It was to do with moving further from an imputation system of corporation tax to, I suppose, a more classical system. That is what drove those changes.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09070185000113"></a>Between 1979 and 1997, because of the interaction of the tax credit arrangements with the basic rate of income tax, the Conservative Government progressively

I have forgotten the percentage, but it was something like 18 per cent over that period.</p>

<a name="09070185000114"></a><b><a name="90701-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070185000193"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I have no doubt that the Minister will acknowledge that, if you reduce tax, you will inevitably reduce the value of the tax credit.</p>

<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="09070185000115"></a><b><a name="90701-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070185000194"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, that was to do with changes to the rate of income tax. Our adjustment was accompanied by changes in the rate of corporation tax that enabled and encouraged companies to continue to invest in their businesses so that, as their businesses grew, they could pay bigger dividends in the future.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09070185000116"></a>In the three years immediately following that change, the value of pension schemes rocketed. What effectively did the damage was the dotcom collapse and what that did to equity values, not only in the UK but around the world. So we reject the contention that there was a raid, in the noble Lord&#146;s terms, on pension schemes. That is not a fair analysis of what took place.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09070185000117"></a>On public sector pensions, I understand that the noble Lord&#146;s leader has proposals to produce a double whammy, with defined contributions in public sector schemes at the same time as having a &#147;pay as you go&#148; basis for existing pensions. Is that right? If so, it would be a very interesting development and, I suspect, a very costly one.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09070185000118"></a>There have been amendments and changes to public sector pensions. The normal retirement age has been changed for new entrants and there have been changes to cost capping and cost sharing. The long-term financial projection over 50 or 60 years shows that those pensions remain affordable, going from around 1.5 per cent at the moment to up to 2 per cent of GDP. So, again, I reject the noble Lord&#146;s assertions on that. However, I know that that is straying somewhat, as indeed did the noble Lord, from the regulations, which, despite some areas of disagreement, seem to be supported.</p>

I think that that was generally welcomed. However, what the Government have given with one hand, they have rather taken away with the other, because upping the incidence of persistence makes criminalisation more likely. Our amendment suggests that &#147;persistent&#148;, if it needs to be defined at all, should be defined only as conduct which takes place on two or more occasions  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_305"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>within any three-month period. As &#147;persistent&#148; is defined in the Bill at the moment, someone could be charged within a short period of a day, several days or over a week, and up to a three-month period.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09070185000120"></a>While the Bill creates a three-month deadline after which the person would have to be seen again by police officers soliciting on two or more occasions, it does not provide a meaningful deceleration of the criminal process in the context of work patterns of the majority of people involved in street sex work. Working patterns vary&#151;we have heard in debate today of the wide variety of people involved in prostitution&#151;yet the reality for the majority of women involved in street sex work is that the factors that lead to their entry into and continued involvement in it mean that most have to solicit regularly, often every day, hence most could still become very easily and quickly caught up in the criminal justice system under the proposed change.</p>

<a name="90701-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09070185000121"></a>As the Minister will know, we have argued for progressive decriminalisation. We feel that this change goes in the opposite direction. There is also a danger that such legislation could encourage intensive, short-term policing operations which criminalised large numbers of women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09070185000122"></a>Unsurprisingly, the Government&#146;s proposition has no support from the Safety First Coalition, which believes that it would be a step in the wrong direction. Given that the Government&#146;s declared intention is that the Bill should make life safer for women, I am sure that they would not want to take a step that made it more criminal and less safe. I beg to move.</p>

I find it deeply frustrating that the Government continue to tinker with existing legislation on prostitution rather than engage in a thorough review of the enormous number of Acts and offences around the subject. Although I support the Government&#146;s rather weak attempts to remove some of the stigma from those seeking to find a way out of prostitution by removing the term &#147;a common prostitute&#148;, it is not nearly enough. The stigma of a name, while it is often an obstacle to getting a job, is only one small part of the problem. The very existence of a criminal record is a much more significant obstacle, as are the circumstances that led to prostitution in the first place.</p>

The biggest barrier to women getting out of prostitution is their criminal record. They are stuck somewhere they do not want to be. Eighty per cent of income from street workers goes to pay their fines, so I do not see how this is in any way going to help women to get out of prostitution or make them any safer.</p>

To talk of conduct being persistent if it takes place on two or more occasions in a period of three months is clearly absurd. That is not persistent. If you replace that period of three months with one week, there is a certain logic to it. Although one might not want it to be there at all, as it were, I certainly support the amendment.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90701-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90701-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09070185000127"></a>Clause 15 would amend the offence of loitering or soliciting for the purposes of prostitution found in Section 1 of the Street Offences Act in removing the term &#147;common prostitute&#148;. I appreciate the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but I believe that it is a step in the right direction. It inserts an explicit requirement to prove that a person has acted persistently. The effect of Amendment 66 would be that persistence, as several noble Lords have explained in this short debate, would be defined as two or more occasions in one week, rather than two or more occasions in three months. This would mean that people could be arrested for loitering and soliciting for the purposes of prostitution only if they were found to have done so on two or more occasions in one week. This would significantly narrow the definition that we are introducing.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09070185000128"></a>We have sought police advice in developing this amendment and believe that it sets the threshold for persistence at the appropriate level. Restricting the definition to cover only those found loitering and soliciting twice within one week would narrow this offence too much and would require greater police resources to collate the necessary evidence. This would limit the power of this offence, and responses we received to our consultation, <I>Paying the Price</I>, suggested there was support for maintaining the offence in order to tackle the problems associated with street prostitution.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09070185000129"></a>The definition of persistence as defined by Clause 15 strikes a balance which gives the police the power to take action against those who are engaged in street prostitution on a regular basis, while taking account of the fact that some may leave prostitution but return intermittently, having lapsed in their attempts to leave. Attempts to restrict this definition would affect this balance, and we believe that the definition that would result from the amendment is too narrow. On that basis, I ask her to withdraw her amendment.</p>

What are the chances of the same beat officers being around twice in three months to witness this offence taking place? To make this stick, presumably the same police officer will have to see the same person meet up with same prostitute more than once in three months. Our experience of beat officers is that, however good, they do not last as long as three months, or they are on night duty, or they are away. That may be fine&#151;it may be that there is no persistence at all and they never get prosecuted at all, and some people would be very glad about that. If you made it twice in a week, there might be some chance of consistency with people passing them on the street.</p>

I presume that it would depend on the beat patterns in different police forces in different parts of the country, from cities to rural areas. As she rightly says, it may have the result that, if beat officers are not there very often, they may not spot what would be persistent in their proposals in the amendment. The police practice is to issue cautions, and that will continue.

They can of course advance an explanation as to what they were doing. We see these changes that were signalled in the co-ordinated prostitution strategy as an important element to that approach. The noble Baroness&#146;s point is a good one, but, if anything, it would assist the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to accept the position, if it meant in reality that there was no difference between twice in three months and twice in one week.</p>

He mentioned at one point &#147;maintaining&#148; the position, whereas the Bill changes the current position. Far from maintaining it, it increases the chances of criminalisation. One of the things that worries me about this is that it will push women to work in places that are even further away from help and more underground, and where they are more vulnerable. It worries me that the Government are moving in the wrong direction. I can see that this evening the Minister is not likely to agree with me, but I should like him to dwell on whether this will make women safer. We all have in the back of our minds the women in Ipswich. If women are trying to avoid being seen by the police, which is what this would encourage, they will solicit in ever more dangerous areas. I see the Minister is slightly tempted to reply to me, so I will let him.</p>

That is central to what we are seeking to achieve in the Bill. Perhaps I should be clearer in what I was intimating to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. It does not have to be the same beat officers, because they issue cautions. The caution will be the evidence of whether there has been a soliciting and loitering offence twice within two months, three months or whatever. As the noble Baroness rightly says, we are not making progress on this issue. The Government see this as a central part of what we seek to do. We do not want to jeopardise the safety of sex workers and prostitutes. The intention of our endeavours is to protect them within the law and to assist them to remove themselves from an industry where many of them are exploited.</p>

In particular, I hope the Minister can give us some detail about what these meetings will consist of. A considerable amount of research material has been published analysing the factors that lead a woman into prostitution and keep her there. These factors are diverse and frequently of a very serious nature, including alcohol and drug addiction or an abusive family life. Prostitution often leaves a woman with long-term problems to overcome if she tries to leave the industry, including serious long-term mental or physical health problems.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09070188000002"></a>It would not be easy for even a well resourced and leisurely rehabilitation system to accurately identify these factors, let alone start the long process to treat, cure and support the patient afterwards.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09070188000003"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raises a sensible point with her amendment about the necessity of ensuring that those coming to the end of their courses are given the information necessary to access any support network available to them. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee that passing over such information will be a priority.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09070188000004"></a>However, perhaps I may ask the Minister whether he imagines that three compulsory meetings, possibly with an unwilling or disengaged patient, will really make a difference. How will the court decide which sort of meetings would be most relevant? Will there be any medical assessment or professional intervention to identify any health problems? Would such an assessment count as one of the three meetings necessary to meet the order&#146;s requirement? And of course, as with so many such initiatives, there will be a problem with resources. I understand that the Government are planning to rely on existing NGOs and charities to provide these meetings. Will they be reimbursed by the courts for their participation? If not, does the Minister not think that these rehabilitation orders could place an unfeasible burden on the third sector?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09070188000005"></a>I have many questions to ask about what level of scrutiny there will be over the quality of advice and support offered by these meetings. Will a government agency be made responsible for ensuring that the meetings are meaningful? What steps will be taken if the courts decide that the meetings were unproductive and badly targeted?</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09070188000006"></a>The levels of support a woman often needs to lift herself out of prostitution and establish herself in a stable and healthy life afterwards are considerable. Although we welcome the introduction of a rehabilitation order as an indication that the Government are starting to accept that criminalising prostitutes just to throw them back on to the streets does nothing to address the problem in the long term, I am very sceptical that the requirement to attend three meetings of an uncertain and unspecified nature will prove to be much more helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09070188000007"></a>As I said, these are probing amendments. However, I hope the Minister will be able to give us more background to the arrangements for this rehabilitation programme.</p>

As the Minister will appreciate, that usually starts with improving their economic prospects. I tabled this amendment because what mostly stops these women improving their economic prospects is the fact that they may not be receiving any of the benefits to which they are entitled; the fact that they may not be aware of other employment opportunities and the training opportunities that go with them; and the fact that affordable childcare is one of the biggest reasons why many women find it difficult to take up other forms of employment. There are a number of women to whom none of those factors will apply, and, as we heard, some women will want to continue to work in the sex industry because it pays very well. Nevertheless, if the Government are serious about offering alternatives, they need to be very focused on exactly which courses are on offer.

<a name="09070188000010"></a><b><a name="90701-0014.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09070188000078"></a>Lord Brett:</b> These new orders will be available on conviction for loitering or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution as an alternative to a fine. They will assist the offenders to begin to address the reasons behind their involvement in prostitution and explore routes out. They will require offenders to attend three meetings with a supervisor in order to address the underlying causes of their involvement in prostitution.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09070188000011"></a>Amendment 67 would replace the requirement to attend three meetings with a requirement to attend &#147;a course of&#148; meetings which would, therefore, be less prescriptive than in the current clause. I am aware that there have been some concerns that three meetings will not be sufficient to address the underlying causes of prostitution. We have always accepted this point and acknowledge that the process of exiting prostitution may be gradual. The aim of the three meetings is to establish initial engagement with services offering routes out of prostitution and to help trigger continued involvement in that process.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09070188000012"></a>Given that the process of exiting prostitution is likely to be long in many cases, it is unlikely that one course in itself could address all the issues necessary, unless it was quite extensive. This would then make the prospect of a breach more likely and could risk setting people up to fail. We do not want to make the requirements of the orders too demanding because the offence is relatively minor and an order is the equivalent of a fine. In the light of the fact that this is a criminal penalty, it is important that there is some clarity about what the order would entail and consistency between different areas as regards the number of meetings that a person would be required to attend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09070188000013"></a>Amendment 68 would remove the provision which sets out the purpose of the order, which is to assist the offender,</p>
<ul><a name="09070188000069"></a>&#147;to ... address the causes of the conduct constituting the offence, and ... find ways to cease engaging in such conduct in the future&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070188000059"></a>The fundamental aim of the order is to help those involved in street prostitution address the causes of their involvement and to help them to find ways to stop working as prostitutes. It is important that the legislation makes this clear to the court, and that supervisors are aware of the aim of the meetings which they will be conducting with the offender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09070188000014"></a>Amendment 68A, which we have not debated in detail and has been tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, would add to the definition of the purpose of the order. The intention of the amendment is to ensure that advice about housing, benefits, employment and affordable childcare can be part of the order. Of course, we recognise that such issues may well be addressed as part of the order and could be vital in helping someone address the causes of their involvement in prostitution. We acknowledge that a number of significant and complex issues will need to be dealt with in order to help someone start to find a route out of prostitution. That, however, is why we do not believe that it would be appropriate to specify which issues need to be addressed on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09070188000015"></a>The needs of each person who is made the subject of an order will be different and complex. For this reason, it is preferable for the purposes of the order to be defined in broad terms and that specifying issues on which advice must be provided is overly prescriptive. In some cases, it may not be necessary to provide advice on childcare, for example. In other cases, there may be other issues on which advice is necessary but which are not specified in the Bill. In such cases, there is a risk that these could be neglected or not prioritised appropriately because of the need to meet the requirements of providing advice on the matters specified in statute.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09070188000016"></a>Leaving prostitution will often be a gradual process, and the process of completing an order will be just the first step for many. It will be necessary for the supervisor to recognise the multiple needs of someone who is made subject to an order and to prioritise these to achieve progress. There is a risk, however, that requiring in statute the provision of advice on a range of matters in a relatively short space of time could be counterproductive and could risk overwhelming the subject of an order with a number of issues and problems that they may need to address, perhaps in a more considered and leisurely form.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09070188000017"></a>I understand why the noble Baroness has tabled this amendment and we appreciate her concerns. We do not believe, however, that her amendment is necessary. Instead, we consider that the issues she raises would be more appropriately addressed in guidance rather than on the face of the Bill. I can assure her that we will deal with these issues in guidance and I hope that for the reasons I have set out, she is persuaded that that approach is preferable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09070188000018"></a>While recognising the need for flexibility, it is important to retain a clear structure to the orders in terms of the number of meetings, the purpose of the order and the

We believe that such requirements are important and will help to ensure that the orders are delivered more effectively.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09070188000019"></a>I hope that a number of the points raised by the noble Viscount were covered in my response; if not, I shall happily seek to provide additional information outside the Committee. A question was asked regarding health concerns. Because there will be almost a bespoke service to the individual, which may include drug counselling and health monitoring, a number of issues will probably be raised at the first meeting.</p>

<a name="90701-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09070188000020"></a>No government agency as such will be responsible for monitoring orders. A supervisor will be appointed by, and be accountable to, the court. Of course, the supervisor will be appropriately appointed for the needs of the person on whom an order has been imposed. We will evaluate the general success of the orders once a sufficient number of cases have been brought and completed, but this endeavour is a genuine attempt to persuade people to start the route out of prostitution.</p>

I had intended to intervene a little earlier but the Minister had already risen to his feet. I still find this a little confusing. It is set out in the Bill that an order is made and a supervisor is appointed and so on, but is that the end of it? As I understand it, the offender can listen to what is advised and to all the things that she needs to take account of, and that is it, and a similar order or any other order may not be made on that &#147;offence&#148;. Is that correct?</p>

If an individual simply sees the order as an alternative to a fine, she will sit through three meetings, which have to take place within six months, without taking any regard of what is said. The situation is not much different from that of people who receive speeding fines. If you get caught for speeding, you are now offered the alternative of attending a half-day course on the dangers of speeding and on how to avoid speeding. In a sense, the intention is to rehabilitate the person guilty of the offence of speeding. Someone can go on that course and sit through it all day without taking any notice. They can then get in their car, drive at an excessive speed on the way home and perhaps get caught again. With this measure, we are hoping to bring out from prostitution people who are prepared to accept and take advantage of the help that is available, which would go beyond the three meetings. It is hoped that support for their problems would then be given within the supervisor&#146;s organisation and beyond. I hope that that answer offers some encouragement to the noble Baronesses, Lady Hanham and Lady Miller, and that the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

This is not a probation order; it is an alternative to a fine. Therefore, will the defendant be told that either they will be fined or that alternatively they can choose to attend rehabilitation meetings? Will there be a choice? Are the magistrates going to tell them that they can choose one or the other? Either

It is important to know whether the decision is an alternative for the Bench or for the defendant. The noble Lord is right: if you are charged with drink driving, you will get time off if you decide to attend a course. However, if you breach that, it will constitute another offence. There will be a bit more to unpick on this issue, so it would be helpful for the rest of our discussion to have clarification on whether that is the situation.</p>

The answer is that it will be for the court to decide and therefore there will be no voluntary principle. The court will presumably make the decision on the basis that an order is more appropriate than a fine. As was said earlier, we are relying on the organisations that are already working in this area. In some areas, this is already happening on a voluntary basis without court intervention, and we see that as a way of taking this measure forward. We do not believe that the resource requirement will be that significant, but if it is, those providing the supervision, and so on, will be the first to tell us about it.</p>

The court can consider anyone to be appropriate and capable of carrying out that role, and the guidance will state clearly the skills that are required. Those people will all be working with specialist projects. We have identified the voluntary sector to do this because it has the greatest experience. If we are trying to persuade people to give up prostitution, it is perhaps better to do that than through the more traditional law and order method. I hope that that answers the noble Lord&#146;s question.</p>

Just as the Bill is largely silent on the details of the meetings, so too is it lacking in any detail on the qualifications, training or experience expected of that person. The role will be critical if the meetings are to have any effect at all. The person will not only have the responsibility to identify what meetings the defendant should attend, but will represent the best opportunity for a prostitute to develop a relationship with a network of bodies and organisations to help her out of prostitution. What scrutiny will be put in place to ensure that the suitable persons are competent? The Bill allows for a new person to be appointed if the first is unable to continue. What will be the grounds for this change? Can the prostitute request a different person?</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09070188000030"></a>I am also uncertain about how the person will reconcile the two aspects of his or her responsibilities. He or she will, on one hand, be expected to support the prostitute, and on the other will be expected to report any breach of the order back to the courts, knowing full well that such a report may result in a fine or worse. How can such a dual role be maintained? Does the Minister expect that suitable person, who no doubt has worked hard for many years to support these women, to be able to send them back to receive a criminal penalty? I beg to move.</p>

The supervisor will normally be based in a dedicated support project for those involved in prostitution where such a process exists in a local area. However, it is not the intention that the role of the supervisor should be defined so as to limit the project work of a dedicated support user in practice. Supervisors may be based in a women&#146;s resource centre or drug rehabilitation organisation. We want to tailor the supervision to the needs of the person who will benefit from the order.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09070188000032"></a>That flexibility increases the potential availability of the order and means that an appropriate supervisor can be identified to deliver the order in cases involving male prostitutes, transgender prostitutes or young people involved in prostitution. All the clause requires is that a supervisor appears to the court to have the appropriate qualifications or experience for helping the offender to make the best use of the meetings, to address the causes of their offending and ways to stop it.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09070188000033"></a>The intention is that the court can use anyone whom it considers appropriate to carry out that role. Guidance will state clearly those who have the greatest skills. They are likely to be people already working in specialist projects. We see a lot of advantages in using existing project workers to act as supervisors, not least that they may be in continuing contact with an individual after the three meetings have ceased. The voluntary sector is identified to deliver that because it has the greatest expertise in dealing with those involved in

A constable or the offender can apply for the supervisor to be changed if they consider the supervisor unable to continue to act. It will ultimately be for the court to judge whether that is the case and whether to amend the order. Equally, if people move from one area to another, adjustments can be made. The idea is to be as flexible and supportive as we can. The requirement for three meetings is but a start, and we hope that many will be encouraged from the first and second meeting to continue beyond the third.</p>

The costings alone call that into question. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, raised the issue. Referral orders have been supported by some projects working with women, but they are in a dilemma.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09070188000046"></a>The Home Office&#146;s assessment does not seem very clear in its answer to the very good question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about whether  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_316"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this is for the defendant or for wider society.<I></I>I shall briefly quote from its summary of interventions and options in its impact assessment of prostitution referral orders. It states that orders are to,</p>
<ul><a name="09070188000066"></a>&#147;help break the cycle of prostitution and by helping prostitutes overcome problems&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070188000060"></a>That is very fair and a perfectly laudable aim. However, in its comments under the evidence base, it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="09070188000067"></a>&#147;Street prostitution is of serious concern as it can involve anti-social behaviour, serious drug abuse, violence and exploitation and organised crime&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070188000061"></a>Whether this rather Victorian attitude is intended to help with those crimes, which can be prosecuted quite separately in any case, or to help the defendant is really not clear.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09070188000047"></a>If the Government are keen to assist prostitutes out of prostitution, they would no doubt like to take some advice from other bodies that have submitted evidence. The Royal College of Nursing, for example, feels that these measures are too punitive to tackle the problem and that forcing prostitutes into these programmes will not work. As it says, prostitutes in the majority of cases are driven to prostitution as an act of desperation, often to fuel a drug habit. It is easy to envisage that maintaining this addiction will lead to non-attendance at rehabilitation meetings. That absence will then lead to recall to court and the extension of a fine or prison sentence to the individual. Criminalisation will drive underground those in need of properly funded and staffed healthcare support.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09070188000048"></a>The Royal College of Nursing is definite that the Government&#146;s approach to this compulsory rehabilitation will not help at all. It has a strong body of evidence. It has worked with a large number of women and suggests that the support offered should be basic and crucial. Access to healthcare support may vary; support may be in offering sex health advice, a supply of contraceptives, needle exchange schemes and drug rehabilitation. The royal college is not at all talking in the terms in which the orders are envisaged.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09070188000049"></a>It is hard to understand where the Government feel that their evidence shows that the approach that they propose in Clause 16 should work. To go back to what we said at the beginning of the Bill, Clause 16 smacks of the state&#146;s wish to exert some sort of moral disapproval of prostitution while simultaneously recognising that it will not go away. It actually reintroduces punishment and custody by the back door. I know that the Minister will feel that Clause 16 is drafted with the best of intentions and that the Government want to help to point prostitutes in a direction in which they can make a change in their lives. In that case, however, why make it punitive if they do not attend the meetings? Why not suggest this as a voluntary measure, without the tag of criminalisation at the end?</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09070188000050"></a>The UK Network of Sex Work Projects has a lot of experience of what works. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09070188000068"></a>&#147;The experience of member projects which operate voluntary court diversion programmes shows that compulsion is not necessary. Our members are happy to advise on such schemes and the learning from them&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070188000062"></a>The network makes the point that a lot of this depends on adequate and sustained funding for interventions, which we have just talked about. Clearly, three visits to  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_317"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anything is completely unrealistic if you really want to give somebody sustained help. If someone has worked even as a volunteer around a CAB office they will know about the length of time that it takes to support somebody to turn their lives around. Such people may and probably do have multiple problems and are more likely to turn their lives around if they are voluntarily attending a series of meetings over months, even years.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09070188000051"></a>The Minister will ask why, in that case, I am not more supportive of starting people off on the ladder of attending meetings. However, putting the limited resources into compulsory schemes is undermining that idea. He spoke of the good work that some of the projects are doing. However, the funding should be put into longer-term voluntary help, which would be far more likely to produce positive results. Therefore, we cannot support Clause 16 as it stands. I struggle to understand why the Government are proposing this as a practical measure.</p>

What else are the Government doing to help prostitutes to find work?

However, only a year ago compulsory rehabilitation was thrown out of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill by this House, so why is it being brought back when all the evidence is against it, particularly in the context of it being conducted by the criminal justice system? That is the wrong organisation to be doing it.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09070188000054"></a>The Minister mentioned one of the voluntary organisations. I would like to take this opportunity to describe the work of a remarkable organisation, which I have had the great privilege of seeing work in Newcastle. The GAP Project is run by a remarkable and extremely brave young woman, Laura Seebohm. She works among these women in Newcastle, conscious of the dangers presented by the masters&#151;if that is the right word&#151;or the pimps who conduct them, and providing support to the women involved in prostitution. That is the aim of the project. She is trying to engage women who have traditionally avoided contact with the agencies because they mistrust them for a variety of reasons: they lack confidence in them; they fear the stigma of going to them; and they have chaotic lifestyles. Everything is against that contact, quite apart from the pressure that they are under from the people who are exploiting them.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09070188000055"></a>Experience over a number of years has shown that this group of women needs specialist services across a wide range of settings, including community outreach, drop-in centres, which they can attend at times when they are able to do so, structured groups, where they feel that there is something they can engage with and get help from people consistently over time, and innovative activities that identify the skills that they have and help them to live useful and law-abiding lives. The key to all this is developing trusting relationships with  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_318"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>staff. The results prove that, once these women become engaged with this sort of system, the demand for that support increases exponentially. They themselves are the best agents for encouraging others to come and join in as a result of what they have experienced.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09070188000056"></a>The project is working in a very difficult and tough area. In fact, at one time this service was run by the probation service, but it deliberately broke away from it because the restrictions placed on the service by Whitehall through the probation service interfered with its flexibility, which is absolutely crucial. It was crucial to make certain that the services were there at all times for the women when they were able to come and use them. The door had to be open for them.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09070188000057"></a>With that sort of evidence from that sort of place, it seems to me to be totally extraordinary that the Government should now be embarking on something that is not structured, not clear, not consistent and not available for people at the times when they need it. It does not seem to me to make any sense to have this organised by the very organisation, the criminal justice system, that is the one part of the structure from which these women shy away.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09070188000058"></a>Therefore, I am extremely concerned at the continuing focus on criminalisation. We mentioned it with children, but it also applies to these women. I notice with some concern that the Public Bill Committee in the other place described Clause 16 as,</p>
<ul><a name="09070188000070"></a>&#147;the sloppiest part of the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Policing and Crime Bill Committee, 10/2/09; col. 322.]</ul>
<p><a name="09070188000063"></a>It said that it was only likely to make matters worse. If you put in place ineffective, unrealistic and compulsory rehabilitation programmes, leading to further criminalisation, you will make the project worse. We should not delude ourselves that an ad hoc court nomination of people who might be appropriate will be anything like suitable for dealing with these problems of women who have got into this situation and need to be helped out of it, as of course do their children, which is a residual part of the problem that must be addressed.</p>

On the initial point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, it is true that this was an issue during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. In the last Session, similar provisions were contained in that Bill but they were withdrawn due to time pressures on that Bill. However, we made it clear at that time that we would seek to reintroduce them at the earliest opportunity. I take some umbrage at the suggestion that it is unco-ordinated when it is part of a strategy that we are trying to develop.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09070193000002"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked why these orders are compulsory, which was echoed by the noble Lord. We recognise that wherever possible orders should be made with the consent of the person subject to the order. However, persistent involvement makes some elements of compulsion necessary. Let us not forget that we are talking about the alternative to a fine, which has become something of a revolving door for many prostitutes. We have heard tonight that perhaps 80 per cent of their income is being spent just to pay fines.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_319"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column 319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90701-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09070193000003"></a>A co-ordinated prostitution strategy encouraging diversion from the criminal justice system into treatment through a conditional caution or a prostitution-specific diversion scheme seems to us to have value. Those involved in street prostitution, as has been very ably said by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, are often significantly socially excluded. They are disengaged from the support service. The complex issues that they face mean that their movement out of prostitution will necessarily be slow and that there may well be a number of relapses. Many will refuse help which is freely volunteered for many of the reasons that the noble Lord has enunciated. Many also exhaust the opportunities for diversion before a route out is taken.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09070193000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked who we are trying to help. The answer is that we are trying to benefit the offender, but if the result is that street prostitution diminishes, a lot of people in local communities will be equally pleased to see a result that is a win-win situation for them. In our view, it is not a single, simple approach. It is part of a co-ordinated prostitution strategy, which is pledged to reform the law on street offences and to introduce a more rehabilitative element. I think that we are all agreed that three meetings will not necessarily solve any problems, but I take heart from the contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. He described an obviously successful and innovative project in Newcastle. No doubt when this becomes law, it will be of great value in assisting the rehabilitation of prostitutes in an area. I think that we are seeing a situation where, if there is no compulsion on those cases where voluntary initiatives are not worked, at present all that there is is a revolving door of fines and more fines.</p>

<a name="90701-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09070193000005"></a>I should like to correct a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She suggested that this was a way of reintroducing custody by the back door. She said that that was to go back to Victorian times. I could be cheeky and say that when she talks of Victorian times it reminds me of Liberal Governments, but I will not. It does not do so because a breach of an order cannot lead to a prison sentence, so in that sense it is not Victorian by any means. Although there has been criticism of this and other clauses, I hope that noble Lords will give the Government credit for seeking from the noblest of motives to assist in this area, but the proposal has had so much doubt cast upon it. However, I notice that the RCN criticism actually points to the requirement for many things that we agree will be in the guidance. We seek to persuade those who are subject to an order that it is in their own interest to move into the GAP project or to seek similar assistance because they will benefit from it. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will not press the Question that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</p>

This issue was debated in another place but I note that since that debate this amendment has been recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The committee expressed concerns that without amendment the provisions could result in someone being detained for a substantial period. While I appreciate the concerns raised by the committee and the noble Baroness, I am afraid that we are of the view that this amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09070193000013"></a>Detention in these circumstances may be required in order to ensure that an offender, who has not only breached an order but also ignored a summons of the court, can be brought before the court to be resentenced for the initial offence of loitering or soliciting. I reiterate at this point that the options available to a court on resentencing are to impose the order again or to impose a fine; the court is not able to impose a prison sentence either for the original offence or a breach.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09070193000014"></a>Previously, when the provisions of this order were proposed in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, they allowed the police to detain an offender arrested for a breach of an order for up to 72 hours&#151;this may be where the English Collective of Prostitutes got its figure&#151;while they awaited a court hearing. This raised some concern as the provisions passed through Parliament. We have acknowledged this and paragraph 9 will now oblige the police to bring the offender before a court &#147;as soon as practicable&#148;.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09070193000015"></a>While I accept that the noble Baroness and possibly other noble Lords still have concerns about this wording, I want to make it clear that, contrary to the suggestion in the Joint Committee&#146;s report, we did respond to concerns that were raised on this issue when the provisions were included in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill in the last Session. First, if a person fails to attend one or more of the appointments as required under these orders, the magistrates will be able to issue only a summons. Previously, we had allowed them to issue a summons or a warrant. It is only if the person subject to the order fails to respond to a summons that the court will be able to issue a warrant. Secondly, the police will now be able to bring that person back before any court, not only the court that issued the original order. This should make it easier for the police to ensure that the offender is brought before the court more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09070193000016"></a>These changes reflect our intention that detention will only ever be used as a last resort, as we will make clear in guidance. However, we agree that, when it is necessary, our priority must be to ensure that the

We are confident that paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 will achieve this objective without imposing an upper limit of 24 hours, with which, in certain circumstances, the police may not be able to comply. For example, if an arrest was made on a Saturday afternoon or evening, the police would not be able to bring the offender before a court until Monday morning at the very earliest. Obviously in such circumstances it would not be possible to comply with the 24-hour time limit.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09070193000017"></a>It is in the interests of the police to bring offenders before a court quickly and, even though we can foresee circumstances where it may not be feasible, we anticipate that in the overwhelming majority of cases offenders will be brought before a court within 24 hours. In those few cases where offenders are not brought before a court within 24 hours, the words &#147;as soon as practicable&#148; provide sufficient protection against undue periods of detention.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09070193000018"></a>However, if someone is detained for breaching an order and believes that they have been detained unduly, they can make an application to the court for habeas corpus, claiming that their detention is unlawful. At this point the police will be required to prove that it had not been practicable to bring the offender before the court at an earlier stage. If the court is not satisfied with the explanation provided by the police, it will demand the immediate release of the offender.</p>

<a name="90701-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09070193000019"></a>I take seriously the concerns that have been raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and, of course, by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. It is important to have safeguards against undue use of detention in these circumstances and that is why we have responded to concerns about the previous provisions. We believe the current provisions provide the appropriate safeguards and are necessary for the reasons I have set out. As such, I ask that the noble Baroness withdraws her amendment.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09070154000003"></a><b><a name="90701-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070154000056"></a>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09070154000004"></a>The then Secretary of State for Defence, the right honourable Des Browne, informed the House on 10 June 2008 of plans to introduce a new national form of recognition for the families of those Armed Forces personnel who die on operations or as a result of terrorist activity while on duty. These plans were based on the recommendations of the military Chiefs of Staff. The Secretary of State said that the recognition would be in the form of an emblem for wear and a memorial scroll similar in concept to those that were issued to the families of those who died in the two world wars and in Korea in the early 1950s.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09070154000005"></a>Much detailed work has been undertaken since that announcement. We had hoped to provide more details before now but there were sensitive and complex issues involved which required much time to work through.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09070154000006"></a>I am pleased to be able to announce further details of this recognition to the House today. These details, recommended by the Chiefs of Staff, have been welcomed by MoD Ministers, endorsed by the cross-government Committee on Honours and Awards and approved by Her Majesty the Queen. In particular, I am delighted to inform the House that Her Majesty has asked that the emblem should be known as the Elizabeth Cross.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09070154000007"></a>The Elizabeth Cross is made of hallmarked silver and is in the form of a cross with laurel wreath passing between the arms. The arms of the cross bear floral symbols representing England (rose), Scotland (thistle), Ireland (shamrock) and Wales (daffodil). The centre of the cross bears the crowned cypher of Her Majesty the Queen. The reverse of the cross will be engraved with the name of the serviceperson in whose memory it is granted. A miniature version of the Elizabeth Cross will also be granted. Both will be presented in a black leather-style presentation box with the royal cypher on the lid and the royal coat of arms on the inner silk lining.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09070154000008"></a>The memorial scroll is on parchment-style paper, headed with the royal coat of arms and the following words: &#147;This Scroll Commemorates ... who gave his/her life for Queen and Country on ...&#148;. The scroll will bear the signature of Her Majesty the Queen in the upper left-hand corner.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09070154000009"></a>The Elizabeth Cross and scroll will be granted in national recognition of their loss and sacrifice to the next of kin of UK Armed Forces personnel who have died on operations or as a result of an act of terrorism. Eligible personnel to be remembered in this way are those who were serving with, or former members of, the Regular and Reserve Armed Forces or the Royal Fleet Auxiliary when deployed in direct support of a  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS20"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column WS20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>designated operation. It is important to make the distinction that this is not a posthumous medal for the fallen but national recognition for the family for their loss.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09070154000010"></a>The next of kin of eligible personnel whose deaths fall into the following categories will be recognised in this way:</p>
those who died from whatever cause while serving on a medal-earning operation. Medal-earning operations are those in which deployed personnel received a campaign medal, general service medal or operational service medal which demonstrated the risk and rigour involved. Operations where a UN, NATO or other international body or other nations&#146; campaign medal was accepted for wear, in the absence of a UK medal, also qualify; those who died as a result of an act of terrorism where the available evidence suggests that the serviceperson, whether on or off duty, was targeted because of his or her membership of the UK Armed Forces;those who died on a non-medal-earning operational task where death has been caused by the inherent high risk of the task; andthose who died a subsequent and premature death as a result of an injury or illness attributed to the circumstances outlined above.
<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09070154000011"></a>In addition to recognising future operational deaths in this way, deaths in the circumstances outlined above that occurred after 1 January 1948, or as a result of service in Palestine since 27 September 1945, will be recognised retrospectively. These dates reflect the fact that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission attributed deaths up to 1 January 1948 to World War II service (with the exception of Palestine).</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09070154000012"></a>The next of kin will receive both the Elizabeth Cross and the memorial scroll. For retrospective claims and when the next of kin is deceased, their legal successor may apply.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09070154000013"></a>Only one Elizabeth Cross is to be granted for each death recognised but an additional scroll will be available to the following (or their legal successors) where they are not the next of kin:</p>
the parents of the deceased; and the spouse/partner of the deceased or someone who had a substantive relationship with the deceased.
<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09070154000014"></a>As a memorial scroll was issued at the time to those who died in the Korean War, the Elizabeth Cross only (and not the new scroll) will be issued in remembrance of those who died during that war.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09070154000015"></a>As with all forms of recognition, there will be those who fall outside the qualifying criteria. There is a risk involved in much of what the Armed Forces do routinely. Some members of the Armed Forces sadly die, for example, in training incidents or in road accidents in the United Kingdom. While any death is a tragic loss to the family concerned and to the Armed Forces, the Chiefs of Staff recommended this new recognition for the special circumstances of operational duty. In addition, they considered that the terrible circumstances where  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS21"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column WS21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an individual was targeted by terrorists because of their membership of the Armed Forces should be similarly recognised.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09070154000016"></a>The first Elizabeth Crosses and memorial scrolls will be granted from one month today, on 1 August 2009. From today, families of those who died in qualifying circumstances are invited to apply for the Elizabeth Cross and scroll to the MoD Medal Office, which will administer the scheme. It is simply not possible to contact the families of all those who may be eligible going back over 50 years, as address details held for next of kin are likely to be out of date.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09070154000017"></a>Full details of how to apply, including an application form, can be found via the MoD website at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/defencefor/veterans/medals/">www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/defencefor/veterans/medals/</a>, while those without access to the internet may call 0800 085 3600 and ask for details to be sent to them.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09070154000018"></a>For new qualifying deaths after 1 August 2009, it is intended that, in most cases, the next of kin will be offered the opportunity for the Elizabeth Cross and memorial scroll to be presented privately and in an appropriate way at the time of the funeral if they so wish.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09070154000019"></a>For retrospective cases, next of kin who are resident in the UK will be offered the opportunity to receive the Elizabeth Cross and memorial scroll at a formal presentation ceremony in the region where they live. Such presentations may be made by a lord-lieutenant or a senior military representative. It is likely to be some months before these events are arranged, as locations will very much depend on the number of recipients living in a particular region and we cannot establish this until applications are received.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09070154000020"></a>If they prefer, families may choose to receive the Elizabeth Cross and memorial scroll by recorded delivery. Next of kin living overseas will normally receive the cross and scroll in this way.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09070154000021"></a>We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces and who have done so in the past. That debt extends to the families who support them and who bear the burden while loved ones are deployed away from home. I am delighted that the families of those who sadly die in the circumstances that I have described are now to receive some tangible evidence of the nation&#146;s gratitude in the form of the Elizabeth Cross and memorial scroll.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09070154000022"></a>Members will be able to view the Elizabeth Cross and memorial scroll from this afternoon in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09070154000024"></a>This Government remain committed to ensuring that finance is not a barrier to higher education, enabling people to make the most of their talents and improving their life opportunities.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS22"></a><b>1 July 2009 : Column WS22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09070154000025"></a>There are 300,000 more students in higher education than there were in 1997. We have achieved this owing to continued government investment, which is over  25 per cent higher in real terms than in 1997.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09070154000026"></a>We are committed to maintaining this increased investment and funding for student support will be increased in 2009-10 by 4 per cent compared with 2008-09. In cash terms, we are planning to spend over &#163;5 billion on student support this year and even more next year.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09070154000027"></a>In 2006, we introduced a radical new package of student support aimed at supporting those who need it most. We predicted that around a third of students would get a full non-repayable grant; in fact, about 40 per cent may receive a full grant, beyond our expectations.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09070154000028"></a>In these difficult economic times, we are continuing to take difficult decisions in the interests of students, universities and taxpayers alike.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09070154000029"></a>We have therefore decided to maintain the current package of maintenance support for full-time students, reflecting the current low inflationary environment.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09070154000030"></a>In 2010-11, students starting a full-time course will be eligible for the same level of upfront maintenance support that was available for new students in 2009-10:</p>
the full maintenance grant will remain at &#163;2,906;the family income threshold for a full maintenance grant will remain at &#163;25,000;the family income threshold for a partial grant will remain at &#163;50,020; andmaximum maintenance loans and thresholds will remain at 2009-10 levels, which for a student living away from home outside London could be as much as &#163;4,950 a year.
<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09070154000031"></a>Students continuing their studies in 2010-11 will also be eligible for the same levels of maintenance support that they received in 2009-10.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09070154000032"></a>In addition, new and continuing full-time students will be able to access a fee loan of up to &#163;3,290 a year, which has been increased by 2.04 per cent in 2010-11 to reflect the uprating of the maximum tuition fee level.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09070154000033"></a>A similar increase applies to fee and course support for new and continuing part-time students in 2010-11, which reflects our continuing commitment to part-time study.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09070154000034"></a>For full-time &#147;old system&#148; students (mainly those who started their courses before 2006) the same principles apply: their fee contribution loans and fee grants will be uprated by 2.04 per cent and their maintenance support will be the same as in 2009-10.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09070154000035"></a>We have also decided to align the financial support for new entrants to postgraduate and equivalent initial teacher training courses with what is available for the generality of undergraduates. Bursaries and other payments for students undertaking initial teacher training will remain available.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09070154000036"></a>In over 500 constituencies, numbers of young undergraduate entrants to higher education have increased since 1997. Also, the 20 most deprived constituencies all show higher than average growth over that period. Some of the poorest areas have seen the biggest percentage increases in young higher education entrants. Education

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09070154000037"></a>To help to maintain this increase in participation overall we will continue to encourage those in receipt of the EMA to think about progression into higher education. In these difficult economic times, it is both fair and reasonable to expect that those students who see an improvement in their financial circumstances are assessed for student support according to their need. We have therefore revised our plans for a guarantee of student support and will offer students in receipt of EMA a clear quote of the student support that they will receive if their circumstances are unchanged at the time they apply for higher education.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09070154000038"></a>The student support regulations will be laid before Parliament today and, following approval by Parliament, will need some weeks to implement. I have asked the Student Loans Company to begin processing new applications for student support as early as possible during the autumn term and for returning students in the new year.</p>

<a name="09070154000049"></a><b><a name="90701-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09070154000061"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> This morning, National Express Group announced that it will not provide the further financial support necessary to ensure that its subsidiary, National Express East Coast, remains solvent. As a consequence, National Express East Coast is no longer able to continue its franchise agreement to its full term.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09070154000050"></a>The Government&#146;s first and overriding obligation in this situation is to ensure continuity of service to passengers, with no disruption or diminution of service standards.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09070154000051"></a>I have therefore established a publicly owned company, which will take over this franchise from the point at which National Express East Coast ceases to operate. We will agree an orderly handover with National Express. Until that date, National Express will operate services on the current basis; after that date, the new public company will do so. There will be no interruption of services. Existing operational staff&#151;who continue to provide a good service&#151;will transfer to the new east coast main line company, as will the assets necessary for the continuation of the service. I can assure the travelling public that services will continue without disruption and all tickets will be honoured.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09070154000052"></a>National Express also operates rail services on the East Anglia main line and associated commuter routes. The company has said that it does not intend to default on its obligations in respect of these franchises. Notwithstanding this, the Government believe that they may have grounds to terminate these franchises and we are exploring all options in the light of the group&#146;s statement this morning. In the mean time, we expect National Express to meet its obligations on these franchises in full.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09070154000053"></a>A company that had defaulted in the way National Express now intends would not have pre-qualified for any previous franchises let by the department. I note that the parent groups of previous franchise failures are no longer in the UK rail business. It is simply unacceptable to reap the benefits of contracts when times are good, only to walk away from them when times become more challenging.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09070154000054"></a>It is the Government&#146;s intention to tender for a new east coast franchise operator from the end of 2010. The specification of the new franchise will reflect my concern to secure better passenger services and facilities. I intend to consult fully on the new franchise specification, including with passenger groups, parliamentarians and the Scottish Executive.</p>

<a name="90701-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09070154000055"></a>The rail franchising system was examined by the National Audit Office last year. It was found to deliver good value for money and steadily improving services. Passenger numbers are at their highest levels since the 1940s, punctuality is over 90 per cent and overall passenger satisfaction is steadily rising. The revenue from rail franchises is enabling us to make record investments in upgrading the network and services  on it.</p>

This was based on the department's understanding that the lack of data was as a result of overseas visitors not bringing their EHICs to the UK. Subsequently, in February 2008, the department identified that trusts were capturing information on overseas visitors but it was insufficient to allow the UK to raise claims for treatment provided. Therefore, the department initiated a project to address this.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_30"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they maintain their view given to the House of Commons Regulatory Reform Select Committee in response to its question 5 published in its report on the Draft Legislative Reform (Minor Variations to Premises Licences and Club Premises Certificates) Order 2009 (2nd Report) that in many cases the extension of music and dancing beyond 11 pm, or the addition of the playing of music to a licence, will not fall within the definition of a minor variation.

<a name="09070168000619"></a><b><a name="90701w0003.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09070168000740"></a>The Minister for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting (Lord Carter of Barnes):</b> Yes. The Regulatory Reform Committee asked:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070168000636"></a>&#147;Why could the definition not exclude particularly controversial matters such as extension of licensing hours at sex encounter establishments, extension of existing music or dancing licensing hours beyond 11 pm, and first-time applications to allow playing of music?&#148;.</p>

<a name="90701w0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_587"></a><a name="09070168000620"></a>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport responded as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070168000637"></a>&#147;DCMS has indeed agreed to exclude most alcohol-related variations in response to the concerns of consultees.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070168000638"></a>In many cases the extension of music and dancing beyond 11 pm, or the addition of the playing of music to a licence, will not fall within the definition of a minor variation. This would be most likely where, for example, the extension would coincide with a pre-existing authorisation to sell or supply alcohol. But there may also be cases in which such an extension could not impact adversely on the licensing objectives, and we would not want these to be excluded from the benefits of the new process&#148;.</p>

<a name="90701w0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_588"></a><a name="09070168000621"></a>The new minor variations process will allow licensees to make minor changes to their licences more quickly and cheaply. As this response makes clear, this may potentially include the addition or extension of authorisation for regulated entertainment (such as live music). In all cases, the test of whether a variation is minor is whether it could have an adverse impact on the licensing objectives.</p>

<a name="90701w0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_589"></a><a name="09070168000622"></a>A live music group has been set up by Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and the Musicians' Union to explain and encourage the use of the new minor variations process for those premises that wish to add live music to their licence. It will also encourage uptake of the existing exemption for incidental music.</p>

<a name="09070168000623"></a><b><a name="90701w0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09070168000742"></a>Lord Carter of Barnes:</b> Under the Licensing Act 2003 (the Act), licensing authorities must carry out their functions under the Act with a view to promoting the licensing objectives. These are the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. Public nuisance, in particular, may present a risk to residential amenity.</p>

<a name="90701w0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_590"></a><a name="09070168000624"></a>The licensing regime under the Act regulates licensable activities (such as the sale by retail of alcohol) by authorising them subject to representations (including representation from local residents) and subject to conditions on the licence or club premises certificate. Although other legislation exists that regulates public nuisance (such as environmental health legislation), this typically addresses problems after they have occurred. The licensing regime regulates potential risks in advance, while allowing the particular circumstances of the premises to be taken into account (including the applicant's own risk assessment and whether existing legislation may be sufficient to mitigate risks). This means, for example, that licence holders have more certainty about what is permitted, and enforcement action is both easier and more rarely required.</p>

<a name="90701w0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_591"></a><a name="09070168000625"></a>Licensing authorities report that simple conditions, such as requirement to close windows and doors, are invaluable in the prevention of public nuisance. More strict conditions or restrictions may be required in certain circumstances. For example, residents of properties physically adjoining licensed premises may benefit from specific noise limits. Likewise, conditions may be attached to a licence to ensure public safety, although the Act does not duplicate health and safety legislation.</p>

It was widely misunderstood, unpopular with musicians and not widely used. Feedback from local authorities' representatives and members of the public, however, showed that two performers with amplification can create a significant level of public nuisance. It was abolished partly for this reason. Additionally, musicians' representatives argued that, given that an amplified duo could make a great deal of noise, it discriminated unfairly and irrationally against the majority of musicians, who perform in larger groups.</p>
