<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will consider re-establishing the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Government have no plans to re-establish that commission. However, we are committed to social inclusion and economic prosperity for all, and recognise the importance of a strong evidence base. We publish <i>Opportunity for All</i> annually, with 60 indicators of poverty and social exclusion, and <i>Households Below Average Income</i> with annual data on income poverty and inequality; we also plan to deliver the first results of a new and comprehensive wealth and assets survey in 2007.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. All those policies are very commendable, but is he aware that the British Social Attitudes Survey shows that 82 per cent of the British people&#151;in other words, across the board&#151;now believe that our society is too unequal? Perhaps they have looked across the North Sea and seen the more equal Scandinavian economies outperforming us, without those at the top end of their companies paying themselves year after year cash increases that are 50 times bigger than those paid to the average employee.
</p>

<a name="51101-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Do we not now need an authoritative commission, including people from all income levels, that is able to get to the bottom of all this? Why, for example, should Britain be the most unequal country in the whole EU 25&#151;certainly in the top three, along with Greece for that particular Olympic medal&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew2"></a><b> Noble Lords </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I am reading some statistics. And should not the commission make recommendations which it should see are carried out, including as regards remuneration committees where the undertakings have been reneged on?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend raises substantive and important issues that are difficult to deal with comprehensively in this kind of exchange but I shall try. First, on the issue of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_118"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

inequality, if we look at the data, median income has risen 70 per cent in real terms since 1996&#150;97 and personal wealth has increased by about 50 per cent in real terms over that period.
</p>

<a name="51101-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>If we look at inequality as measured by the Genie co-efficient, the IFS analysis shows that after continuing rises in the early years of this Government before policy initiatives kicked in, that continued to rise, but it has fallen over the past three years. It is too early to say whether that shows a trend. It depends upon our continued success in tackling child poverty and pensioner poverty. However, we have stopped the inexorable rise in inequality that characterised the 1980s. In 1997 child poverty was higher in the UK than anywhere else in the EU and had more than doubled since the mid-1970s.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the creation of wealth in our economy has far greater importance than its distribution?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, each is important. We need to have an economy that is successful, which we do; we need to create wealth, which we are in favour of, and we should not fetter the opportunity of people who create wealth; but at the same time we need to have policies in place to ensure that wealth is fairly shared. That means in the short term at least making sure that people have sufficient incomes, and in the longer term making sure that those people who are currently disadvantaged have pathways to sharing through training, re-education and all of those upskilling issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, do the Government not need to get to grips with the damage done to job satisfaction and a broad sense of fairness in our society by the fact that it is reported that this autumn 3,000 people in the City&#151;dealers, brokers, bankers, and so on&#151;will be getting bonuses of over &#163;1 million?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Government cannot regulate pay in the private sector for executives or directors. Perhaps I did not deal with the point raised earlier by my noble friend on directors&#039; pay. Under this Government the Directors&#039; Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have come into force since August 2002, which has improved transparency and accountability and the reporting of performance linkage. A report in 2005 by Deloitte & Touche underlined the effectiveness of those actions so far as directors&#039; pay is concerned, which showed that there had been a significant increase in the levels of compliance with the regulations, growing investor satisfaction with improved disclosure on directors&#039; pay and awards, and that companies are changing their remuneration policies and practices to reflect the link between pay and performance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that we have a great deal of statistics on both wealth and income and the disparity in those two areas? Does <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_119"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 119</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

he further accept, and will he confirm, that the real reason that the Government do not have it in mind to set up a Royal Commission is because they have no intention of doing anything about that disparity?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, with respect, my noble friend is completely wrong about that. It has been at the heart of the Government&#039;s policies to tackle those things. I shall reiterate the components: to help people into work, which is a way of sharing in the wealth of the country; to help those families with children to ensure that they are removed from child poverty; and to make sure that the lot of pensioners&#151;their position in relation to poverty&#151;is improved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew11"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, there is a lot of information to impart. If one asks the question one should get an answer about what is going on. Some 2 million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute low income under this Government, and between 1996&#150;97 and 2003&#150;04 the proportion of pensioners living in households with relative low incomes after housing costs fell by a quarter or 700,000 people. That is tackling issues of inequality, and there is a similar story on tackling child poverty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, since some of the greatest wealth is now to be found on the Benches behind the Minister, how will he ensure that that wealth is fairly distributed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, government policies do not discriminate between those on these Benches or on the Benches opposite. We seek to treat all people fairly and reasonably.
</p>

<a name="51101-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it is the turn of the Cross-Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords, will the noble Lord consider investing significantly more in foster carers? They are often among the poorest in our society, and some of them are out of pocket for the care that they provide for children. Furthermore, investing in and recruiting foster carers would not only raise that group up but would provide more stability for children in the care of the state, and those children would do significantly better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, it is not for me to set the public expenditure framework at the Dispatch Box, but the noble Earl is absolutely right.
</p>

<a name="51101-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The Government have invested more funds in this direction. The reality is that there is never enough money to do everything we want as soon as we want. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_120"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Certainly arrangements which help young children in particular, and create better life chances for them, are important and are at the heart of what we are about.

<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What estimates they are making for council tax rises in 2006&#150;07.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51101-01_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  My Lords, the Government are committed to supporting local authorities in delivering improvements in key public services without imposing excessive demands on their council tax payers. The Government do not forecast future increases in council tax. Council tax rises in 2006&#150;07 will depend on local authorities&#039; spending decisions.
</p>

<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the Local Government Association has identified a shortfall of around &#163;1 billion in spending for adult social services and children&#039;s services as a result of spiralling demand, more imposition from central government, reduction in central government grant under the Supporting People programme, and higher than average cost inflation? When the Government set the level at which local authority expenditure is capped, will they take into account the duty owed by local authorities to the most vulnerable and needy people in their areas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, we are certainly aware that the Local Government Association has identified that sum, but we do not agree with it. We agree with the drivers on pressure the noble Baroness identified, and we are working with the LGA, looking at the papers it presented to us, and at ways to mitigate our pressures, and so on. We will obviously think about this matter seriously. Our problem is that some of the estimates are unsubstantiated: for example, returns from some local authorities are uncosted. We have begun consultations on costs; for example, the minimum fostering allowance. We have problems with some of the assumptions, and therefore with the totality of the estimates, but we believe that the level of grant we anticipate will meet the increased pressures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is special provision made for stress areas that receive large numbers of asylum seekers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the share of spending will reflect all the different pressures that go into making up the services as a whole.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, what are the Government doing to increase the take-up of council tax benefit by pensioners? In spite of the Government&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_121"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

efforts to improve the income of pensioners, about which we heard in the previous Question, there are many who find the tax terribly difficult to pay and still have big problems. What are the Government doing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness asks a very good question. We are concerned. We have 2.4 million of the poorest people in the country missing out on council tax benefit and pensioners&#039; take-up is between 60 per cent and 65 per cent of what it should be. We are doing something that is quite innovative: the Pension Service is ringing pensioners who think they might be entitled to claim council tax benefit. It takes the details over the phone, fills in the forms and sends them out, so the pensioner has only to sign them. All those applying for pension credit will, from September, be able to have their council tax benefit processed on the phone. That will help, and ultimately we want to move to a situation where people who are entitled get automatic benefit. We are working hard to see how that can be achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, is the experience of revaluation in Wales what has caused the Government to take fright over revaluation in this country? Will the Government make permanent the temporary, transitional relief in Wales, on the revaluation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, council tax in Wales was a matter for the Welsh Assembly, and we did not take fright. The reasons for postponing the council tax revaluation here were set out in great detail on 20 September. We asked Sir Michael Lyons to look at the current and emerging strategic role of local government&#151;we all know the many different things that have changed in local government in recent years. In the light of this work, he will address the critical funding issues which will include those of fairness and accountability. Revaluation, when it comes, will reflect that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, the Government have given local authorities stringent targets for efficiency savings under the Gershon proposals and reforms. They have done so to allow local authorities to improve and invest in services, which is what the Minister referred to in her Answer. Many local authorities are doing that successfully. Will she assure the House and local authorities that the efficiency gains made throughout the country through the Gershon programme will not be clawed back by central government to solve their own funding problem with the council tax next May?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, it is true that some local authorities across the country&#151;ones as different as Camden and Warwickshire&#151;are making efficiency savings and improving services. We are pleased to see it and want it to happen in every local authority. It is interesting that the local government authority papers, which are clearly committed to making efficiencies, state that there are opportunities to work smarter and better, to stabilise services and to drive down costs. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_122"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That is why the target for delivering efficiencies to the end of 2005, which would be savings of &#163;2.15 billion, should be exceeded.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What steps they have so far taken to carry out their commitment to lessen the load of government, in particular to streamline regulatory structures and reduce the quantity of legislation.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Better Regulation Executive was established in May 2005 to lead the work on promoting better regulation across government. It is on track to deliver the commitments set out in the March 2005 Budget and the better regulation action plan published in May this year.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   My Lords, I hardly know what to say. Is the noble Lord aware that, in that Answer, he has not even reached the low level of expectation that I had when I tabled the Question? Is it possible that he and some of his colleagues are not aware of the fact that the Government increasingly are and have been for some time a burden that should be lightened? Is there no hope of such a thing happening?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am surprised at the noble Lord&#039;s approach to this important Question. I am sure that he is aware that we as a government have done a great deal to reduce the burdens on business. Only in the past few years we have exempted 900,000 companies from audit requirements, and now provide the highest VAT threshold in Europe. We have reduced payroll burdens for 1.2 million businesses and, as noble Lords on the opposition Front Benches are well aware, have introduced changes to the planning system that make it faster, fairer and more efficient. Those are concrete reductions in the way in which government operates. I am surprised at the noble Lord; if I remember rightly, just last week he and many other noble Lords were urging yet another regulatory measure on us&#151;a Civil Service Act.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, what are Ministers in this Government doing to persuade their colleagues in the EU that, somehow or other, the endless flow of regulations promoted by the Commission has to be abated? When will the Government start arguing for the Commission to be deprived of its sole right to initiate legislation, which means that it alone has the right to initiate repealing legislation to get rid of some of the unnecessary legislation clogging up the system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, our Government are taking a lead in Europe to deal with regulation. I agree with the noble Lord&#039;s fundamental point that regulatory reform is important if European <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_123"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business is to remain competitive in a global economy. I would be absolutely on his side on that. It is also worth recalling that, on 25 October this year, the Commission itself announced plans to simplify some 1,400 regulations and remove unnecessary burdens. The Commission recently announced that it would withdraw 68 proposals that do not follow what it and governments generally consider best regulatory practice. We are winning the argument in Europe about the need to have proportionate regulation; that is what we need to ensure if we are to have thriving business across the EU.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Howarth of Newport: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that of course people do not want excessive government; they vote Labour because they want better&#151;fair and decent&#151;government; and that since 1997 that is what we have had in the main?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51101-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I completely agree with the noble Lord, which will come as no surprise to your Lordships. We have to understand that regulation is extremely useful and beneficial. For instance, I know that it is alleged that we pile on regulation after regulation every year, but who among us would want to get rid of regulations that prevent child abduction, control the proceeds of crime, provide for flood defences, deal with disorderly behaviour, and so on? They are all necessary legislation. Who would want to abolish such regulations?

<a name="51101-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, are the Government acting on the advice of Sir David Arculus of the Better Regulation Task Force that better regulation would be assisted, particularly in respect of overlapping legislation, if they had a programme of codification and simplification at home, as well as encouraging it in the EU?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we have a process of simplifying and bringing together regulation to ensure that it does not overlap, which is part of the explanation behind the Government&#039;s decision to reduce the number of regulatory bodies from 31 to only seven. That is a bold move in itself, which will ensure that we get better focused regulations when they are introduced.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

President Ahmadinejad. We summoned the Iranian charg&#233; d&#039;affaires on 27 October to protest. On the same day, we issued a statement on behalf of the European Union heads of government which condemned the comments in the strongest terms. The statement emphasised that calls for violence and for the destruction of any state are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community.

<a name="51101-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I suggest to him that the best response to that incitement to terrorism&#151;that is what it was&#151;is to treat the Iranian resistance as a friend who stands in the way of the mullahs&#039; attempts to produce a lethal mix of Islamic fundamentalism and nuclear weapons. Will the Minister now review or remove the proscription on the Iranian resistance to signal support for those helping the people of Iran to achieve, through a saffron revolution, the democracy that the mullahs most fear?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I understand why my noble friend has made that proposition, but I regret to tell him that we have no plans to carry out such a review. The MEK is proscribed in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. The MEK has a long history of involvement in terrorism in Iran and elsewhere and is, by its own admission, responsible for violent attacks that have resulted in many deaths. The MEK is listed in the United States as a foreign terrorist organisation and is on the EU&#039;s asset-freeze list. Its claims to be a democratic party, fighting for a better Iran, are hard to square with its history of violence and authoritarian acts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is now getting extremely hard to divine and to fathom what the Government&#039;s policy is towards Iran? Every initiative taken by the Foreign Secretary and his European colleagues on a quiet diplomatic basis seems to have failed. Will the Minister tell the House how the situation at the Security Council will shape out? Does not the key to any more forceful pressures on Iran lie with the agreement of China? Is he aware that China has just signed a $100 billion gas and oil contract with Iran? Will he undertake to jog the elbow of his colleague, the Foreign Secretary, to raise this matter with the Chinese leader, Mr Hu, when he visits London next week?
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, all the permanent members of the Security Council, and others, are fully cognisant of the difficulties in achieving some of the changes that we need. We are not na-ve about the nature of the regime that we are dealing with. We do not underestimate the difficulties on the nuclear issue, on Iraq, on human rights, on fundamental freedoms, on the peace process and on terrorism. But Iran and those issues are too important for us&#151;or China or any other country&#151;to sit on our hands. The options have to be looked at realistically. Cutting links with Iran will do nothing to advance those objectives. The United States, which has no contacts with Iran, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_126"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continues to urge us to maintain our contacts with Iran to try to keep some dialogue going. These are difficult circumstances and we must all in the Security Council work together for a peaceful resolution of those issues before the situation spills into a worse one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that the whole House and the whole of Parliament are entirely with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Security Council and the Prime Minister in making plain our absolute unwillingness to accept the ludicrous claim of the new president of Iran? For many of us, this has echoes of an earlier era, when talk about abolishing whole races and countries was frequently heard. However, can the Minister confirm that the ambassadors of Iran to London and to Geneva have been recalled, partly because of the conciliatory positions taken by those particular diplomats? Finally, will he recognise that for many of us the crucial key to Iran is to begin to build up much stronger support among the younger people in that country who clearly do not share the fanatical views of some of their leaders. One contribution that can be made towards that is to move ahead with the road map, which seems to be stuck in the way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="51101-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, for the points that she made. If we are able to reach younger people in Iran&#151;there is a good deal of evidence that they plainly have different views&#151;there are good prospects for the future. As the noble Baroness said, the remarks made by the president of Iran just a few days ago reflect what the Canadian foreign minister described as evidence of the same kind of hatred, anti-Semitism and intolerance that have been heard elsewhere before. A number of Iranian diplomats have also been sacked by the president in the last few days, at least according to media accounts. I have heard nothing that contradicts those.
</p>

<a name="51101-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>I impress upon the House that, however difficult it is, when one looks at the range of options before us, it is a matter of building carefully with those who are our friends in Iran, who are part of the future of Iran, and not finding ourselves in an escalating position where the steps that we take generate more conflict, rather than making an attempt to resolve matters by peaceful and diplomatic means.

which we do it in a democratic country do not rely only on the Government. Independent institutions, such as the BBC through the World Service, broadcast objectively and fairly on all the matters about which people in Iran no doubt seek the truth, in just the same way that we would. For our part, we will continue to use those instruments at our disposal, such as the Chevening scholarships and other means of getting to younger people, including exchanges with our university institutions. I do not suggest for a moment that this is a quick or easy resolution of the kinds of difficulties identified in the House this afternoon, but they are all means that we must deploy.

<a name="51101-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Aviation is our gateway to the world. The range of destinations served directly by regional airports has expanded enormously in recent years. More and cheaper flights afford opportunities to travel undreamt of by earlier generations, with half the population flying at least once a year. Many fly more frequently as business travellers competing in the global marketplace or as leisure travellers taking <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_128"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

advantage of the greater opportunities to discover other countries and cultures and, sometimes, to benefit from their better weather.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Aviation makes a substantial contribution to our national economy, estimated at &#163;10 billion in 2002, which represents about 1 per cent of economic activity in the UK. The industry provides 200,000 jobs directly, and three times that number indirectly. Air passenger duty contributes just under a billion pounds a year to the Exchequer.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>So here we have a successful industry. However, no debate can ignore the fact that those living close to airports may not necessarily see aviation in such a positive light. To some it has a significant negative impact on their quality of life. This Bill will honour a number of important White Paper and other commitments covering both environmental and consumer protection issues.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Over the years, there has been an increase in air traffic, but there have also been substantial improvements in the noise levels of jet aircraft, and noise at many of our major airports has reduced significantly as a result. It remains important, none the less, that communities affected by noise should feel assured that their interests are taken fully into account as the aviation industry continues to develop. Part of a government-sponsored research project is therefore investigating whether peoples&#039; attitude to aircraft noise has changed since the 1980s, when research underpinning our current understanding of the relationship between annoyance and aircraft noise was carried out. This study is due to report next year. I am pleased that this Bill will strengthen and clarify powers to control aircraft noise and emissions, in line with the commitments made in <i>The Future of Air Transport</i> White Paper.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The Bill will amend the powers by which the Secretary of State currently controls aircraft noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The Bill will also introduce new statutory provisions for controlling aircraft noise at airports where the Secretary of State does not exercise these powers. We consulted on our proposals in 2000 and announced our conclusions in 2003 as part of the White Paper package of announcements. Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 empowers the Secretary of State to exercise direct control of noise measures at &quot;designated&quot; airports. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted have been designated and noise control measures at these airports include noise preferred routes, departure noise limits and night noise restrictions.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Although we consider the existing powers to be broadly appropriate, the White Paper gave a commitment that we would amend Section 78 so that controls such as night restrictions might, subject to public consultation, be set in future by reference to the amount of noise generated by aircraft alone, without a separate movements limit. This would mean that the primary control at an airport regulated by the Secretary of State could be related more directly to the noise nuisance, providing a more effective incentive for airlines to acquire, use and develop quieter aircraft.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_129"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>I should emphasise however that amending these powers should not be interpreted as a precursor to any immediate change in policy for noise control at the designated airports. For example, the proposals in the stage 2 consultation on night flight restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted which closed recently, on 16 September, is based on the legislation as it currently stands. I can confirm that the final decision will set limits for night flights until 2012 for both movements and noise quotas.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I can assure noble Lords that any proposals to change the arrangements by which we control noise at the three designated airports would be subject to consultation in the normal way. Although we have done so voluntarily for many years, this is now a requirement of European legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51101-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Mawhinney: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister assure the House that the Government have no plans to designate airports other than the three to which he has made reference?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="51101-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as I shall indicate later in my speech, we are taking powers with regard to certain controls, but not in terms of designation beyond the three airports. I hope to be covering that point as I develop my remarks.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Although the Government have a direct role in noise control at the three designated airports, elsewhere airports are, apart from any planning restrictions that may apply, responsible for their own noise control arrangements, usually as part of their conditions of use. This accords with our longstanding policy, re-emphasised in the White Paper, that wherever possible aircraft noise problems are best resolved locally by the airport working with the local community. In the majority of cases this works well.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>However, in the White Paper and the department&#039;s <i>Control of Noise from Civil Aircraft: The Government&#039;s Conclusions,</i> we gave a commitment to clarify and enhance airport powers in statute. Although the majority of airports have introduced noise control measures as part of their conditions of use, and civil aviation legislation contains a number of provisions relating to environmental issues, this does not include any explicit statutory provision for airport managers to control aircraft noise. The Bill therefore provides explicit statutory powers for airports to develop noise control schemes.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The Bill defines the maximum area within which the airport&#039;s powers to control aircraft noise apply, although there is provision for the Secretary of State to alter this in individual cases by consultation. The standard definition is designed to encompass noise-related operating procedures, such as noise preferred routing for aircraft taking off, which go significantly beyond the boundaries of the airport itself. The Bill also puts on a statutory footing the ability of airports to impose penalties on aircraft operators that have not complied with the terms of a noise control scheme. We are aware of one major airport, for example, which is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_130"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

awaiting statutory powers before imposing discretionary financial penalties for aircraft deviating from preferred noise routes.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The power for airports to impose penalties is balanced however with a requirement that aircraft operators should have an opportunity to make representations to the airport operator regarding the imposition of penalties. The ideal situation of course is that by airports and airlines working collaboratively&#151;which they do in the majority of cases&#151;the need for financial penalties is kept to the absolute minimum. But where financial penalties are appropriate, as a measure of last resort, the Bill provides for the local community to benefit from this money; which in practice tends to happen anyway.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I emphasise that where existing arrangements are working satisfactorily the expectation will be that such arrangements will carry on. But the provisions of the Bill are designed to help those airports which may be looking to refresh or enhance their existing arrangements in the future. In the case of larger airports&#151;those with over 50,000 movements per year&#151;the Aerodromes (Noise Restrictions) (Rules and Procedures) Regulations 2003 set out the procedures that major airports should follow when considering measures to deal with noise problems. That reflects the adoption by the EU of the International Civil Aviation Organisation&#039;s balanced approach&#151;in short, that airports should not impose measures more restrictive than necessary to achieve noise objectives and should not discriminate on grounds of nationality, air carrier or manufacturer. Although the regulations currently apply to 10 airports the White Paper explained that the Government expect the underlying principles to be applied at all significant UK airports.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Civil aviation legislation currently enables licensed airports to fix their charges for using the airport by reference to the noise aircraft make. Additionally, the Secretary of State may direct an airport to do this, although he has not found it necessary to do so to date. However, this legislation goes back to 1982, when there would have been little or no expectation that airports would wish to vary their charges by reference to aircraft emissions.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The Government&#039;s air quality strategy has since set out air quality objectives for air pollutants intended to protect human health as well as vegetation and ecosystems. These are derived from EU air quality directives. Although on a national scale the contribution of air transport to these impacts is small&#151;certainly compared with road traffic for example&#151;its effect can be significant in individual cases. We therefore gave a commitment in the White Paper that the Government would bring forward legislation enabling the Secretary of State to require an emissions-related element to be included in landing charges at airports where there are local air quality problems.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>In fact, BAA has already incorporated an oxides of nitrogen emissions element, based on European classification of aircraft for emissions charging, into its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_131"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

airport charges at both Heathrow and Gatwick as part of the conditions of use. By making explicit the power to do so in statute, the Government wish to send a clear message that they support airports that want to incorporate the use of economic incentives to help tackle any local air quality problems. The Secretary of State will retain the discretion to issue a direction in individual cases, should he consider this necessary at some future date.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>It has been suggested in another place that provisions to deal with aviation&#039;s contribution to climate change are missing from the Bill. In addition to setting out the Government&#039;s plans for tackling local air quality problems, the <i>Future of Air Transport</i> White Paper also set out the way in which we intend to tackle that contribution to climate change; namely, that the best way of ensuring that aviation contributes towards the goal of climate stabilisation would be through a well designed, open emissions trading regime.
</p>

<a name="51101-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>As aviation is an international industry, an international trading regime would obviously be the best solution. Therefore, we are pressing for the development and implementation, through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of such a regime. A greenhouse gas trading scheme is already in operation in Europe and we have also been working to include intra-EU air services in the EU&#039;s emissions trading scheme. That is a priority of the UK presidency of the European Union, with a view to aviation joining the scheme by 2008 or as soon as possible after that date.
</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="51101-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, what is the response of the Americans on emissions trading?
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="51101-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is a tougher nut to crack. We have a considerable way to go on the issue of emissions worldwide and by all airlines. I am seeking to emphasise that we are seeking to develop the European scheme more fully, to include aviation. I hope that my noble friend will recognise that that will be a very significant step forward and will increase the basis on which Europe approaches the issue of worldwide emissions.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a> In addition to the environmental provisions, the Bill also contains two important measures relating to the financial protection and health of air travellers. The Government are committed to improving consumer protection for air travellers. The Bill takes a step forward by ensuring that the Air Travel Trust Fund can be replenished by contributions from the aviation industry. The Government have decided not to make an amendment to the Bill to implement the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s recommendation for a &#163;1 levy on all air passengers departing the UK. We believe that the attractions of the CAA scheme are outweighed by the disadvantages.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>First, the levy would be compulsory. In line with other sorts of financial protection, the Government do not believe they should compel citizens to protect themselves against the failure of an airline. Secondly, there is no logical reason why the state should organise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_132"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

refunds for any one particular group of consumers. The ATOL scheme has been in place since the 1970s and, alongside the European directive on package travel, was introduced specifically to protect holidaymakers from the risks involved in paying out significant sums to travel organisers many weeks, if not months, before the date of travel.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Thirdly, although the levy would reduce the difference in protection given to package and independent travellers, it would not eliminate it altogether. There would still be a two-tier system as those who assembled their own packages would have cover for their flight but not for loss of accommodation or car hire. The Government appreciate that the package travel regulations impose costs on tour operators, which they see as an unfair competitive advantage for scheduled airlines. However, the CAA-proposed levy would replace that imbalance with another. The same &#163;1 would purchase cover for the traveller who buys a low-cost flight to Europe for under &#163;30 and for the traveller who has booked a two-week package in the Far East or the Caribbean. The budget traveller would pay a much higher percentage of his outlay to ensure that there is enough money in the pot to refund to the long-haul package passenger should his tour operator fail.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The Government are committed to reducing regulatory burdens on business and to regulate only where necessary and in a light-touch manner. A levy is a heavy-handed instrument to solve the problem of informing a population that has easy access to a multitude of information sources which are increasing continually
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Passengers are also said to need special protection if they are stranded abroad. The Government realise that not all travel insurance covers insolvency. However, some insurance does. The CAA&#039;s assessment and the example of EUjet this summer showed that people generally find their way home by other routes. Of course, they may incur some expense and inconvenience, particularly if they are not insured, but it is not fair to impose a levy on all air passengers just to provide cover for that. In the case of EUjet, other airlines stepped in to help and have told the Government that they intend to learn lessons from the experience to improve the effectiveness of future voluntary rescue efforts. Similarly, when Swissair and Sabena failed, other network airlines honoured the homeward tickets of passengers abroad.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The Government have been encouraged by airlines&#039; assurances that they will continue to take voluntary action on repatriation. The Government will be talking further to airlines in the coming weeks to ensure that effective voluntary measures are put in place as rapidly as possible. Nevertheless, we recognise that the current bonding system for tour operators can be a barrier to market entry and can tie up capital. The Government have therefore asked the CAA to review whether the system of ATOL bonds could be replaced with a more efficient means of meeting tour operators&#039; obligations under the package travel directive, while at the same time replenishing the Air Travel Trust Fund following the passage of the Bill.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_133"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>In 2001, in its excellent study of air travel and health, the Select Committee on Science and Technology of this House recommended that the Government should ensure that concern for passenger and crew health becomes a firm priority. In March 2003, in response to that recommendation, we announced the establishment of the Aviation Health Unit&#151;a dedicated facility within the Civil Aviation Authority for the provision of health advice to passengers, airlines and others. The unit, which has been in operation since December 2003, is presently being funded by the Department for Transport. However, it has been the policy of successive governments that such costs should be borne by the aviation industry rather than the taxpayer. We have therefore included a clause to enable the CAA to recover the cost of the Aviation Health Unit from the industry by a suitable charging scheme. The CAA will of course consult on the most appropriate charging mechanism, but the amount of money involved is extremely small, amounting to less than half a percent of what airlines currently pay towards the cost of the Civil Aviation Authority.

<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51101-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, the current regulations do not extend to people who are on board the aircraft. Will the Government therefore consider amending the regulations accordingly? It is an anomaly without any justification.

<a name="51101-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I hear what my noble friend says. He will also have the opportunity very shortly to make that point more fully in his speech, to which we all look forward. It is a point that we could discuss in Committee. However, as I think he will recognise, we have taken a considerable step forward by establishing the unit. It is only right that the Civil Aviation Authority should take responsibility for how it operates.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Under current legislation, in the Airports Act 1986, an airport company owned by a local authority or a group of local authorities&#151;known as a &quot;public airport company&quot;&#151;or any subsidiary is prevented from engaging in activities in which none of its shareholding local authorities has the power to engage. That restriction was considered entirely appropriate at the time. However, there have been calls in recent years for the restriction to be relaxed to allow for successful public airport companies, such as the Manchester Airports Group, to develop their businesses and to serve better their local area and the wider region.

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>On two occasions amendments to other Bills were tabled in this House and subsequently withdrawn, although the Government made clear their sympathy with the principles of relaxing those restrictions and clarifying the position where there is uncertainty. In June 2003, the Government&#151;in the guise of my noble friend Lord Rooker&#151;gave a commitment to consider the matter further with a view to bringing forward legislation when a suitable opportunity arose. This is the opportunity and we are pleased to be honouring that commitment.

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Bill will therefore allow the Secretary of State, by regulations, to specify permitted activities which he considers to be incidental to or connected with the business of operating a commercial airport. He will be able to set conditions on the permitted activities&#151;for example, limiting their scope to activities of a commercial nature or to activities carried out in certain countries or territories. That could include selling their expertise in airport management and development, in air traffic management, airport security, specialised airport fire and rescue services, the ground handling of aircraft, passengers and freight, as well as freeing them to enter into a wider range of joint ventures in connection with airports. Our aim is to allow public airport companies the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field, here and abroad, and I commend these measures to the House.

<a name="51101-05_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, for decades people living around airports have listened to assurances from Ministers about the expansion of air travel, assurances that they will not suffer more noise or pollution and assurances that global warming will not be affected. How can the Minister have any confidence that the new measures in the Civil Aviation Bill will deliver where previous governments have not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="51101-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Baroness will recognise that we are committed to operating a regime of enhanced control. It is on the basis of the effectiveness of these measures that I have confidence that that will occur. The argument that I am developing is about the freedom of airports to enter into commercial activities. That may have nothing at all to do with the issues she has raised; it will merely bring to the areas and regions of those airports the benefits of successful commercial activity, which may of course be carried out elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Clause 6 will revoke the role of the Secretary of State as the point of appeal in aviation route licence cases. Aviation route licensing cases concern the allocation by the Civil Aviation Authority of frequencies available to UK airlines in circumstances where restrictive bilateral aviation agreements between UK and foreign countries prevent UK airlines from mounting all the services they would like to provide.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Airlines make proposals to the CAA about how they would use the available frequencies, and the CAA makes a decision on those proposals based on its assessment of which of them will bring the greatest benefit to consumers. The CAA gives effect to its decisions by conditioning airlines&#039; route licences. It is currently possible for an airline to appeal to the Secretary of State against a CAA decision. That is what we are proposing to remove. Our intention is to streamline and modernise the process in the interests of consumers and the industry. The CAA is the body with the greatest expertise in assessing the consumer and competition issues on which the allocation depends, and we think it right that the CAA alone should make the necessary determinations. The current possibilities of appeal to the Secretary of State add a political dimension which is no longer <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_135"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appropriate now that the airline industry in the UK is a mature and competitive industry. And experience suggests that airlines automatically lodge appeals against CAA decisions as there is no incentive for them not to do so. That can delay the take-up of new services considerably and disadvantage consumers to no good purpose in many cases.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>We considered the possibility of retaining an appeal to an alternative body such as the Competition Commission but concluded that that would make the process even more time consuming and bureaucratic&#151;and no less expensive&#151;than it is at present without adding any real value to the assessment which is carried out by the CAA. We want consumers to enjoy the benefits of additional services with the minimum of delay consonant with a proper assessment of the relative merits of different airlines&#039; proposals for services.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>We are confident that the CAA&#039;s processes, including a public hearing at which evidence can be examined and questioned, provide for a full and transparent assessment of the merits of the various proposals. It may be open to a disappointed applicant to seek a review of the lawfulness of the CAA&#039;s decision through the courts. We consider that this combination is sufficient to ensure that the demands of regulatory accountability are met, and to safeguard the parties&#039; rights under the Human Rights Act. We have consulted the airlines, the CAA and the Air Transport Users Council, the consumer body. A majority of those who responded supported the reform.
</p>

<a name="51101-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>In conclusion, I consider the Bill to be positive for those who live near airports, for the traveller and for the aviation industry. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="51101-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this small yet highly significant&#151;and, dare I say, contentious&#151;Bill. It follows the Government&#039;s aviation White Paper, although, as we have just heard from the Minister, there is a hotchpotch of measures, some better than others. Sadly I do not think that the Bill has a strategic shape or clear purpose. It will be a difficult job to follow its ultimate consequences.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The Bill gives the Secretary of State the authority to do quite a lot of things but it is not clear what he will end up doing. There are provisions on noise, emissions and ensuring against corporate failure, but there is no comprehensive policy on either noise or emissions.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The aviation industry has seen dramatic wholesale changes in the past decade. We have witnessed a significant increase in air travel, combined with the emergence of new carriers, low ticket prices and Internet purchasing. At the same time, airports have attracted significant levels of internal investment, with BAA investing some &#163;6 billion since privatisation. The number of passengers has risen dramatically, from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_136"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

51 million in 1982 to 189 million in 2002, and by 7 million in 2001&#150;02 alone. The Government estimate that there will be 500 million air passengers by 2030. That has a significant and substantial impact on the environment.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Research by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change claims that, at the present rate of growth, aviation emissions would wipe out all the emissions savings made by other sectors of the economy. It would be almost impossible for the Government to meet their stated objective of reducing CO2 emissions by 60 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050. Aviation emissions alone explain why CO2 emissions have increased since the Government came into power. Yet the Government concluded in the White Paper that there was a desperate need for additional runway capacity in the south-east. With developments at Gatwick scuppered until 2019, the burden of expansion will be placed on the other London-centric airports, particularly on a second runway at Stansted. I declare an interest: as noble Lords may know, I am leader of Essex County Council.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Although there are no provisions in the Bill on a second runway, it was dealt with in the White Paper. Existing runway capacity in the south-east should be developed without building any further capacity. I am sure that that issue will be discussed in Committee. Nobody believes that Stansted could possibly finance out of its own revenues the hugely expensive infrastructure expansion required for a second runway. I wonder where the cash would come from for the new roads, dedicated high-speed rail line and M11 junction, not to mention all the infrastructure requirements for the growth in workforce required to operate and service a vastly expanded airport. Many of us cannot help but think that the Government&#039;s entire thinking on the future of aviation is misguided and confused. In the case of a new runway at Stansted, and possibly one at Heathrow, the market probably does not want it and environmentally it would be disastrous for all concerned. In short, the Government have a piecemeal approach to that, but they have no overall strategy, which presumably is why there is nothing about runways in the Bill. The Bill is a case in point: it is neither one thing nor the other. It clearly illustrates the confusion on those issues, which we will explore further in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>As regards some of the specifics in the Bill, I shall turn, first, to noise. We know that airports have had the power to fix their charges with reference to noise since the Aviation Act 1982. But for the resident on the ground the current methodology for the measurement of noise is highly unsatisfactory. While noise is measured in decibels, the equivalent continuous sound level is an index of exposure to aircraft. It is a measure of the equivalent continuous sound level averaged over a 16 hour day from 7 am to 11 pm, and can be taken in the peak summer months from mid-June to mid-September.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The continuous level system underestimates aircraft noise in three key areas. First, averaging out the noise can be misleading; secondly, low frequency noise is ignored; thirdly, continuous level classifications <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_137"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

underestimate the level at which noise annoys people. In short, decibels are an unsatisfactory measure of nuisance. It is the drone and roar of aircraft that disturb people. The entire methodology desperately needs an urgent review. I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some indication of whether the Government are entirely content with the existing regime or whether there are any thoughts on conducting a review into noise.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Clause 2(2) empowers the Secretary of State to discontinue applying limits to the number of night aircraft movements at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and to replace them with noise quotas alone. The current position is that a movements limit and a noise quota apply to night operations. A night noise quota alone would produce a lesser standard of protection because, as I have tried to explain, the present methodology of monitoring noise is decidedly unsatisfactory. In addition, as aircraft become less noisy more flights could be accommodated within the same noise quota and there would be no real benefit to the local community. Again, as I have already mentioned, there is no such thing as a quiet aircraft: there is noise from all aircraft. Virtually all night flights disturb the peace. Therefore, it is important to retain the limits on the number of night flights as well as the aggregate noise output.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>During the Second Reading debate in the other place, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary gave an assurance that the Government would consult stakeholders before making any changes to the current arrangements. However, I cannot help but think that this is a Government merely going through the motions. On this issue, they seem to have made up their mind. I should like the Minister to comment further on that.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The Under-Secretary additionally gave an assurance that night movement limits at the three London airports would remain in place until at least October 2012. However, if Clause 2(2) remains as presently drafted, the Secretary of State could commence consultation immediately after Royal Assent. It would be possible for night movement limits to be abolished as early as October 2006. Therefore, we need to amend that part of the legislation. It is thoroughly disingenuous for the Government to try to portray that as offering greater protection for local communities by encouraging the use of quieter aircraft through noise quotas. I give notice that we will seek during the passage of the Bill to remove that relaxation in regard to restricting night flights.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Airport operators are responsible for monitoring and reporting on the environmental impact of their operations&#151;acting as judge, jury and policeman. In addition, at all UK airports, except Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the airport operator is responsible for deciding which environmental noise objectives should be adopted. There is considerable mistrust among local communities in relation to the fairness, objectivity and transparency of the current in-house arrangements for reporting on aircraft noise, emissions and track keeping, and for recording and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_138"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

handling complaints from members of the public regarding aircraft noise and other environmental impacts.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Instead, would it not be preferable for an independent body such as the CAA or even the trading standards departments of local authorities to take on this role thereby restoring trust, confidence and integrity back into the process? Indeed, the CAA is perfectly capable of taking on this role and Section 5 of the 1982 Act empowers the Secretary of State to require the CAA to exercise the role of environmental watchdog. The resource implications could be minimised if the CAA were simply charged with overseeing the monitoring and reporting of environmental impacts at airports and, of course, it already has the necessary expertise as well as a reputation for fairness and integrity.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Another area of concern in the Bill is the powers that it gives to airport operators to fine an aircraft operator who breaches any noise abatement requirements imposed by the Secretary of State. We found it odd that the Bill then allows the manager of an airport to spend those,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;penalties for purposes which appear to him to be likely to be of benefit to persons who live in the area in which the aerodrome is situated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>That gives the manager of the airport the discretion to spend that money. He could have a passion for golf and might build a golf course in the vicinity of the airport. That could happen because of the way in which the Bill is currently drafted. How would that benefit the people in the vicinity of the airport? I would welcome an explanation from the Minister about the circumstances in which the fines could be spent.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The other main issue in the Bill is emissions. In principle, the idea of allowing airports to take into consideration aircraft emissions when levying landing charges is reasonable. However, the Bill simply allows emissions conditions to be included in contracts; it does not determine on what basis they should be included. Whether airport operators are necessarily the best people to possess this duty and how it will work in practice are points on which we will want to probe the Government in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51101-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>There are several other matters in the Bill that the Minister mentioned which I will not go into today but which we will explore in Committee. In conclusion, we feel that this is a rag bag of a Bill that lacks overall strategic direction. It has missed an opportunity. Many of its measures are questionable in their benefit to the ordinary user of air travel.

<a name="51101-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, in reply to the noble Lord, I have mentioned several issues&#151;the policing of noise, for example, should be done by the CAA or trading standards.

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>As I said, many of the policies in the Bill are questionable and I want to speak for the ordinary user of air travel. However, during the course of the proceedings on the Bill we must consider&#151;as was mentioned in an earlier intervention&#151;the residents who have the misfortune to live on the flight path or very near airports.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="51101-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I accept that this is a limited Bill and not one that sets out the Government&#039;s policy on civil aviation&#151;it simply seeks to tidy up a few loose ends. One would assume&#151;and perhaps the Minister will confirm this&#151;that in due course we will be presented with something fairly substantial by way of government policy. However, it is useful that we mark down now the things that we will want to see in that policy when it comes to fruition. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, mentioned noise limits and we are also worried by the fact that a noise quota may replace the noise number. The number of aircraft that are allowed to land at night can be counted fairly easily by people.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>If we get into a noise quota, we are then getting into the subjective area of how much noise each aircraft makes. I would hope, in any event, that whatever obligations the Government might have to the International Civil Aviation Authority or whomever we can still discriminate in favour of quieter aircraft. That is what people want. I am rather concerned about track keeping. I am concerned in two ways. First, there are few areas in this country that qualify for the description of tranquil areas. The maps are published by the CPRE and are in various colours, but fewer and fewer areas are not noisy. I would seek assurances from the Minister that the people who are responsible for routeing aircraft, whether in NATS or the CAA, when drawing up the aircraft routeing, will both prescribe the exact route that the aircraft will follow&#151;so that they do not wander about and cause disturbance in tranquil areas&#151;and also closely monitor the track keeping&#151;the route that the aircraft takes on approaching and leaving an airport.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I am not reassured by a piece of paper which has come into my possession from Manchester, saying, in respect of one of the airports&#151;Manchester&#151;that it has no legal powers to fine off-track aircraft. It has achieved an impressive 95 per cent compliance without resorting to financial penalties. I hope that there really will be financial penalties and that these will be invoked if people stray from the paths that they agreed to follow. There is not much evidence that aircraft operators are actually being fined.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_140"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I want to draw the Minister&#039;s attention to one point that I find very worrying. That is the reference to decibels. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred to them in his speech. I quote from the Manchester arrangements, where the predefined noise level is 92 decibels during the day and 85 at night. The fine for breaching it is currently &#163;500, which does not seem very much, and &#163;150 per decibel thereafter. If anyone knows anything about physics, a decibel is a logarithmic scale. That means if you go up from 85 to 92 decibels, you have pretty well doubled the noise level. The fine is &#163;150 a decibel. The fine should be logarithmic as well, if it is bear down on the noisiest aircraft. It is a clear error in the Bill, or in the arrangements rather, as it is not specified in the Bill. I think that people who are subjected to very noisy aircraft really expect the operators of those aircraft to be very heavily hit, because the business is not poor and it can afford the technology to be quiet.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Another issue I want to raise&#151;it was not raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield&#151;concerns the EU emissions trading scheme. The trading scheme, as far as I know, depends on aircraft operators being allowed to continue to emit greenhouse gases provided they buy licences from somebody else&#151;let us say, someone who is running a steel works in Czechoslovakia. So, the steel works in Czechoslovakia emits less and the aircraft here burn more. I believe that that is how it works.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>It seems to me there is a perverse incentive here&#151;that someone in Czechoslovakia may have an incentive to keep a rotten old steelworks tottering along in order that he can sell the permit to an aircraft manufacturer here when logic would demand that the rotten old steelworks or coal plant or whatever should be closed down. But if you introduce into the balance sheet of that enterprise abroad the revenue from the aircraft permits here, it will be kept going. That does not seem to me to be very environmentally friendly . I hope that the Minister will address that matter.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Otherwise, the Bill contains a number of very welcome additions. I support what the Minister said about health and the Air Travel Trust. I also support what he said about public airport companies. I see no reason why Manchester Airport cannot sell its services on the open market if they are produced competitively. However, I endorse some of the reservations expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We on these Benches shall be very sceptical about plans to expand Stansted or any other airport unless they are accompanied by very thorough noise reduction and pollution reduction measures. We are worried about whether airports themselves should be the final arbiters in such matters as track keeping and noise. The CAA is independent and is seen to be independent. However, the material that the airports publish refers to the money which they put into the local community trust fund. That is probably welcome but it may cover up the fact that they are not really doing their job properly.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Finally, one of the matters that gives me great cause for concern is the amount of energy which airports absorb at ground level. The surface access to airports, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_141"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people driving to and fro, the heating, the lighting, the services at airports and the vehicles that the airport companies use constitute at least half the pollution which is associated with air travel. When further proposals are put forward I should like to see a real clampdown in that area as the scope for making savings there is probably much greater than it is with the aircraft themselves.

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Noble Lords might be relieved to hear that I propose to confine my comments to this clause alone.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I have recently tabled several Written Questions relating to flight safety and passenger and crew health on commercial aircraft during contaminated air events. A &quot;contaminated air event&quot; occurs when the air supply provided to the passenger cabin and cockpit, which should be clean air, becomes contaminated with pyrolised engine oils or hydraulic fluids. One of the contaminants is an organophosphate known as TCP, hence my interest in this subject. Contaminated air events, which do not occur on all flights, appear to have caused pilots to become incapacitated or partially incapacitated. I wonder whether noble Lords are as surprised as I was to learn that the air supply to the cabin and cockpit, known as &quot;bleed air&quot; because it is bled off the engines, is not filtered in any way. Consequently, if that air becomes contaminated, passengers and crew inhale the contaminants. Even more surprising is the fact that commercial aircraft are not required to have contaminated air detection systems. Passenger safety depends entirely on pilots to take action if they suspect the air to be contaminated. A pilot&#039;s sense of smell is not checked in their medical examinations, and some contaminants such as carbon monoxide have no smell. Is it really safe to rely on a pilot who may be suffering the early effects of chemical poisoning to respond correctly to an incident?
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The more deeply I have inquired into the issues the more interesting they become. As long ago as 1977, a 34 year-old navigator on a US Air National Guard Lockheed Hercules was incapacitated. A paper was written by the senior medical doctor for the National Air Guard, Dr Wier, who had treated the navigator. He clearly realised that the navigator had been exposed to and was suffering from the effects of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_142"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contaminated air. In his paper, he stated that further investigation into the potential hazards from inhalation of synthetic oil fumes was definitely warranted. Some 28 years later, on 10 October 2005, just a few weeks ago, a British airline captain collapsed and vomited on the apron of Aberdeen airport following a similar exposure.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>While we are told that contaminated air events occur rarely&#151;once in every 22,000 flights was the figure given in a Written Answer in 2000&#151;that figure differs significantly from what the British Air Line Pilots Association reports. For example, in 2002, BALPA published the results of a survey of 105 responding pilots who experienced 1,600 contaminated air events in Boeing 757s, yet the CAA had less than 100 events on its database. That discrepancy alarms me. Apparent under-reporting on this scale should be a matter for concern, yet the Minister assured me in a Written Answer last week that,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Of course air crew take aviation safety seriously. Unless they are kamikaze pilots, they want to get to their destination as much as their passengers do. Under-reporting is a serious issue that should be investigated. I understand that BALPA asked the CAA to carry out a joint campaign to encourage crews to report all contaminated air events, but the authority declined. Additionally, according to BALPA, despite being asked to, the CAA has never contacted crews or their medical practitioners after contaminated air events to understand better the effects of exposures.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I also understand that BALPA advised the CAA that TCP had been detected in commercial jet aircraft and that its members frequently recorded elevated levels of carbon monoxide. I wonder just why it is that the CAA declines to support seemingly sensible initiatives or follow up reports that concern passenger and crew health. Some conspiracy theorists apparently say that it is a well-known fact that the aircraft with the highest number of reported events per aircraft manufactured is British-made&#151;the BAe 146. Others may suggest that it is simply because the CAA is totally funded by the industry, so the hand that feeds should not be bitten.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>In 2000, the CAA chief medical officer suspended a BAe 146 pilot&#039;s medical certificate based upon the opinion of a neurophysiologist that the pilot was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;probably suffering some sort of chemical exposure on a BAe 146&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>and was, therefore, a threat to flight safety. In a Written Answer to Paul Tyler MP&#151;now the noble Lord, Lord Tyler&#151;the Minister stated that the CAA was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;not aware of any adverse long term health effects in flight crew that can be traced back to the cabin environment&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 9/2/04; col. 1234W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The pilot is still grounded.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Following the contaminated air conference in April 2005, the Aviation Health Working Group stated:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_143"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;Representatives of the Department of Transport and the Department of Health attended the recent international conference on contaminated air, but no new evidence on the presence or effect of low levels of organophosphates in aircraft cabins was presented&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I understand that, in fact, such evidence was presented. OPs were detected in the cabins of Boeing 757 and BAe 146 aircraft, and almost 20 doctors and scientists presented new papers with ground-breaking data.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Despite publishing a paper in 2004 which indicated that air quality was within exposure limits, the sampling was never done during a contaminated air event. There appears to have been no attempt by the CAA to assess the long-term effects. Both the Australian and United States&#039; aviation administrations clearly take matters much more seriously than does the CAA. They have spent a lot of money investigating problems, and there is a current investigation by the USA.
</p>

<a name="51101-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>While I recognise that cabin and cockpit air quality is only a factor in the health and safety concerns to be addressed in Clause 7, it is a vital factor. There is some evidence that the CAA is somewhat reticent about carrying out its duty to protect air crews and the public from contaminated air events by not taking them as seriously as it should. It is our duty to ensure that such a situation should not be allowed to continue, and if I am not assured that this new clause will allay my concerns, I am prepared to bring forward amendments in Committee and at later stages of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="51101-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, this Bill gives us the opportunity to debate a wide range of issues concerned with aviation. The fascinating speech we have just heard from the noble Countess is one such, which I am sure we will come back to at Committee. I will concentrate on three issues: the first is the protection of air travellers, which I will refer to last; the second is the Bill&#039;s proposals on noise and night flights; and the third, which I shall deal with first and which is perhaps the most important of all, is climate change.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made a remarkable speech. I agreed entirely with his words on climate change, and am particularly pleased that he quoted the research from the Tyndall Centre, and drew the conclusion that we have to do something about emissions if we are to have any chance of meeting our 2050 targets of reducing CO2 emissions by 60 per cent. Perhaps my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis was a little unkind in asking him to commit himself to Conservative policy, but can I tease from him an admission that the logic of what he said is that the only way one can have any chance of meeting those climate change targets is by checking the growth of air travel and reducing the demand for it? I take exception with the Government, this Bill and the aviation White Paper because it contains no provision whatever for restricting the growth of air travel.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_144"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Climate change is the most pressing environment issue facing us. In a speech in September last year, the Prime Minister described it as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;a challenge so far-reaching in its impact and irreversible in its destructive power, that it alters radically human existence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Shortly afterwards, our own Sub-Committee D of the European Union Select Committee, under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, published an excellent report on climate change. Launching it, the noble Lord said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;The stark truth is that this is a global problem which unsolved is likely to produce truly catastrophic effects. Only sustained global action will provide a solution.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Individuals need to change their behaviour. The EU can lead by example but the impetus must be on citizens to consider how they can contribute to global warming&#151;and make changes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>As we have heard, aviation is the fastest growing source of climate changing emissions, and that is where we must start.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>It is a pity that the aviation White Paper instead of addressing the climate change issues chose to promote growth in air travel, and sought additional runway capacity in the south east, starting&#151;as we heard&#151;with Stansted by 2013. I suspect my noble friend Lady McIntosh of Hudnall will say more about Stansted, and I do not want to steal her thunder. However, it is worth remembering that Stansted is not fully utilised now, has no intercontinental traffic, and 90 per cent of its flights are operated by easyJet and Ryanair. We heard some examples of how Ryanair treats its disabled passengers at Questions yesterday. Most of us are rather tired of Mr O&#039;Leary&#039;s dismissive attitude to any suggestions that his airline should behave like a responsible corporate citizen.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I turn to the issue of noise and nuisance. I trust that my noble friend will have some answers to the points made by the London Borough of Hounslow and the other local authorities under the Heathrow flight paths. They make the point that the Bill appears to remove the limit on the number of takeoffs and landings at Heathrow, and weakens the controls on aircraft movements during the current night quota period. They fear that Clause 2(2) would end the existing aircraft movement limits by replacing, in Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;limit the number of occasions on which they may take off or land&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;impose limits or other restrictions relating to aircraft taking off or landing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Given the known lobbying skills of the aviation industry, one can easily envisage a time when it would argue that the introduction of quieter aircraft meant that it had reduced the nuisance caused by noise to such an extent that the night flying restrictions could go altogether. Some persuasive briefing has been issued by the HACAN ClearSkies campaign, the voluntary organisation that campaigns on behalf of residents around Heathrow affected by the flight paths. It makes the point that existing ways of measuring aircraft noise are unsatisfactory. Again, I agreed with what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said about that. It is the frequency of noise events that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_145"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wrecks a good night&#039;s sleep, not the fact that the event itself might be slightly less noisy. If I am unable to sleep through noise events greater than 90 decibels, it will not make any difference if what wakes me up is measured at 92 rather than 98 decibels. Less noisy does not mean not noisy at all. What makes a difference to my sleep and that of other people who live under the flight paths is the number of times in a night that noise occurs, which is why the numbers limit on night-time movements must be retained.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>My final point is a matter that most people in the travel industry hoped and expected to see in the Bill, but that has been excluded from it. I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the matter. I refer to the proposal from the Civil Aviation Authority that a &#163;1 levy be imposed on all outbound air passengers from the UK to fund a new scheme that would provide protection for all air travellers who have the misfortune to be stranded abroad through the collapse of an airline or tour operator. That would replace the existing air travel organisers licensing bonds&#151;the ATOL bonds&#151;which the CAA has run for the past 30 years, and provide comprehensive consumer protection for everyone.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Perhaps my noble friend did not address sufficiently the fact that the travel industry has changed dramatically in the past few years, and legislation has not kept up with those changes. Not so long ago, close to 100 per cent of consumers enjoyed financial protection when booking travel because they went with tour operators. Now, with the advent of no-frills airlines and websites, barely half of them enjoy financial protection, although most of them think that they do. Thirty years of the ATOL system has led consumers to believe that, when they buy a scheduled airline ticket, they will be protected if something goes wrong, but that is not now the case. Consumers also believe that if they book accommodation, car hire and other ancillaries from an airline website, they will be protected if things go wrong. Again, that is no longer the case.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The situation that I describe affects others as well. The traditional tour-operating industry is strictly regulated by the EU package travel regulations of 1992. Traditional tour operators have their cash tied up in bonds to protect consumers, have many onerous responsibilities to their customers, have to pay VAT on their margins and are forced to spend hundreds of hours of management time on administration in connection with bonds. None of those responsibilities or costs applies to the airlines or web-based companies that now compete head to head with the traditional tour-operating industry. The &#163;1 levy&#151;or something similar&#151;would provide the opportunity to level the playing field between traditional tour operators and the airlines, which now increasingly behave as if they are tour operators, but without having the same legislative burden.

<a name="51101-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Russell-Johnston: </b>   My Lords, has the noble Lord&#039;s attention been drawn to the recent case in which the insurance ombudsman found against Thomas Cook, which had resisted supporting the <br>&nbsp;<br>

payment of insurance to a girl who had had her leg amputated three years ago? The problems being outlined are not confined to the recent-entry companies to the holiday industry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="51101-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, whose point reinforces my argument. I agree that it spreads it wider.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>On Third Reading of the Bill in another place on 10 October, the junior Minister Karen Buck said, as my noble friend did today, that the Government had decided not to accept the CAA&#039;s advice, and that the public should have the right to decide whether or not to buy insurance to protect themselves financially. The Minister said that an across-the-board levy of &#163;1 was &quot;disproportionate&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I urge my noble friend to reconsider the matter. Members of the public who buy holiday packages already pay for their protection. They have no choice because the tour operators are obliged to include such cover in their holiday prices. The Government said that it would help consumers to learn more about air travel insurance, but they seem to have overlooked the fact that such insurance costs a lot more than &#163;1. In addition, that insurance does not arrange repatriation for those who are stranded abroad.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The most recent airline to go bust is EU Jet, to which my noble friend referred, which used to fly out of Manston in Kent. It collapsed in July at the height of the holiday season, leaving 12,000 tourists abroad and another 27,000 people waiting to travel. The CAA in its report of the collapse said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;If a managed scheme with a central administrator was in place, repatriation could have been arranged more cheaply, at no cost to passengers, and they would have been able to travel as intended with little or no disruption to their holiday and therefore less anxiety. Passengers yet to travel would also receive a refund irrespective of whether they paid by credit card or debit card&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>EU Jet was one of 18 scheduled airlines in Europe that have collapsed in the past four years. It will not be the last because there is still overcapacity in the airline market. More consumers who believed themselves to be protected will have their holidays ruined when more airlines collapse, and they will incur costs that they have not budgeted for.
</p>

<a name="51101-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I hope that we can come back to the subject in Committee, and that even if the &#163;1 levy is not acceptable to the Government, we can consider an alternative way of providing the same sort of protection to customers as the tour operators. I hope that we will have the chance to discuss those matters, and the matter to which the noble Countess, Lady Mar, referred to. I look forward to the later stages of the Bill.

<a name="51101-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Flather: </b>   My Lords, I shall start by picking up the points made by the noble Lord at the end of his speech. He commended the Bill to the House by saying that it was positive for the airlines, consumers and residents. I am sorry but that is not how the residents around Heathrow airport perceive it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_147"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>That point has been made by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, on behalf of Hounslow, but does the Minister realise that 12 local authorities are affected by the noise levels and flight paths around Heathrow? They are all extremely concerned about Clause 2, which amends Section 78(3) of the Civil Aviation Act.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I am a resident and former councillor of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. I am sure that today, if other Peers lived in the boroughs surrounding Heathrow, they would all speak on this. It is of the deepest concern to the residents and to the local authorities that the Secretary of State will have the flexibility, the discretion and the power to introduce night flights on the basis of noise alone. I cannot put it better than the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and my noble friend Lord Hanningfield.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>One point that has not yet been made is that it does not matter how low aircraft noise is at night as at night time we can hear the smallest noise; we can hear a car on the road that we do not notice in the daytime. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, touched on this matter. He said that a little less noise will not make a difference. I emphasise that night-time is a very quiet time and almost any level of noise&#151;the noise-free aircraft has not yet been invented&#151;will keep the residents near and around the airport awake at night. Many lives have already been blighted. There are many examples of how flight paths have been chosen; the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, mentioned how flight paths are changed and organised so that they blight people living under them.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I want to provide the House with an example. On 14 October this year, there were 649 movements in a 24-hour period from Heathrow, during easterly operations, when aircraft were landing over Windsor. During that week there were seven days of continuous easterly operations, providing little or no respite for local residents, except for about three or four hours during the night. Noble Lords who have been in Windsor during the day will know that one has to stop talking, even in enclosed places, when planes fly over. If that is to happen at night, the residents of the royal borough will certainly not have very much sleep.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The local authorities took the Secretary of State to judicial review in 1993&#151;that was under the present regime. I do not know whether anyone has noticed, but Clause 2(2) takes away from local authorities the right of judicial review as regards limits so that they will not be able to question the Secretary of State via a judicial review because it will no longer be <i>ultra vires</i>. That is another very deep concern. As has been stated by Karen Buck, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for transport in another place, nothing will happen until 2012. One noble Lord has already said that there have been many broken promises and if noble Lords were to read Commons <i>Hansard </i>they will see lists of broken promises. There is no guarantee for people to ensure what goes on because in the end the legislation says that the Secretary of State can change the situation if he thinks fit by one means or another.

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a> I am an inveterate traveller and I have been using Heathrow the whole of my life. I would like nothing better than to fly at night because that would make it easier to get flights and we may not have to arrive in another country in the middle of the night. We always leave here in the daytime, but arrive at our destination at night. I believe that it is worth the sacrifice for the sake of all residents, who need at least some hours of peace at night. I would be sad to see that amendment go through, and will strongly support the amendments that will be put forward from this side of the House.

<a name="51101-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend the Minister is the most courteous and charming of men. Even he, however, must have groaned inwardly&#151;I suspect possibly even audibly&#151;when he saw some of the names on the speakers&#039; list for this debate. He will have been well aware of the axes that were about to be ground in his presence, and has heard most of them ground already. I fear they will go on being ground throughout the passage of this Bill, because there is, quite obviously, mounting concern across all parties and the country about the impact of aviation on our environment and quality of life. Much as I should like to brighten the Minister&#039;s day by greeting this Bill with glad cries, he will not be surprised to learn that I am not going to. I can promise him, however, that I will not go on at great length because I only have two points to raise, which have already been raised by others.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I am indebted to the Stop Stansted Expansion campaign, which has provided excellent briefing on the Bill. However, I can also add personal testimony to the general arguments that they have brought to my attention. I live on the patch of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in Uttlesford. If Uttlesford does not mean much to your Lordships, it is a beautiful part of rural north Essex, often cited as one of the best places to live in the UK. I can testify to that.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Uttlesford district has within it a number of historically important buildings and settlements, including the towns of Saffron Walden and Great Dunmow, and the famous villages of Finchingfield and Thaxted, where I live. These are not, however, mere heritage showpieces preserved in architectural aspic for the benefit of tourists and inhabited by part-timers in green wellies driving 4x4s. They are living and breathing, with shops, pubs, schools, hospitals and many thriving small businesses, together with the usual range of problems which go with being a dynamic community. Sleepy they are not. The reasons for their wide-awake state, however, are not all good. They are all within 15 miles of Stansted, and some of them, like my own village, are directly under the approach path into the airport. The issue of aircraft noise, and night flights in particular, is therefore of acute importance, as a number of noble Lords have already pointed out, not only to the people who live near Stansted, but to everybody who lives or works near any airport.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_149"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 149</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>As my noble friend the Minister and others have noted, Clause 2(2) of the Bill amends Section 78(3)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 in such a way as to empower the Secretary of State to discontinue applying limits to the number of night aircraft movements at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted, replacing them with noise quotas alone. Under current law, there is both a movements limit and a noise quota applied to night operations, providing a complementary set of protections for local communities.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The Government appear to believe that the number of movements can be allowed to increase because aircraft are becoming less noisy. We have already heard from a number of your Lordships that that is not conspicuously true, and I can assure your Lordships that even the most modern aircraft can be pretty noisy when it is right over your head in the middle of the night. Even if it were true, however, any benefit we might gain from the development of quieter engines would be lost if the numbers of flights were unrestricted. All night flights disturb, as my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester graphically pointed out. They are particularly disturbing, oddly enough, in rural areas, where the general level of ambient noise at night is low. We must retain limits on their numbers, as well as on aggregate noise output. Furthermore, a movements limit is far easier to understand and monitor than noise quota limits, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw&#151;who I see is no longer in his place&#151;noted. It provides vital protection to those who live very near an airport, although not necessarily directly under a flight path, and are especially disturbed by ground noise at night&#151;another issue which has come up during this debate. Will my noble friend consider&#151;I know what the answer will be&#151;either deleting Clause 2(2) from the Bill or alternatively amending it so that movement limits remain in place?
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>It is only fair to say that my noble friend has given the House an assurance today that night movement limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted will remain in place at least until October 2012 and that assurance is welcome. But under the arrangements proposed in the Bill as it stands, the Secretary of State could begin a public consultation immediately, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has pointed out. An assurance was given that the Secretary of State had no intention of using Clause 2(2) to abolish local airport limits on daytime aircraft movements, but this Bill would provide the Secretary of State with statutory authority to do just that. Could my noble friend say why, if the Government do not intend these powers to be used, they are included in the Bill? Alternatively, could he say how the assurance given by himself and his honourable friend in another place are to be incorporated into the Bill so as to prevent it being used in ways the Government do not intend?
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Finally, I draw my noble friend&#039;s attention again to the fact that the prevailing system of independent monitoring of the environmental impacts of air traffic, currently the responsibility of the owners and operators of airports themselves, are viewed with deep <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_150"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suspicion and mistrust by communities in the vicinity of airports, who believe that their fairness, transparency and objectivity cannot be relied upon. The Bill presents an opportunity for the 1982 Act to be amended to give the CAA the responsibility to act as regulator and overseer of environmental standards, as the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Bradshaw, noted. I know that there have been issues about the resource implications of such a change and I cannot believe that these would be impossible to overcome. Are the Government prepared to consider this matter again?

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I am aware of the importance of air transport to the economy of this country and I am not so na-ve as to imagine that the benefits it brings can be secured at zero cost to local communities and to the environment, despite my profound personal wish that individuals and governments would wake up fast, as my noble friend Lord Faulkner has suggested they should, to the frightening long-term implications of our love affair with cheap flights and out-of-season asparagus. There is a limit, however, to what people should be expected to tolerate by way of disruption to their daily lives and their nightly rest in the name of economic growth.
</p>

<a name="51101-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>As it stands, this Bill does nothing to rebalance that equation&#151;indeed, it has the potential to make matters worse. When my noble friend comes to reply, I hope that he will be able to allay some of our worst fears.

<a name="51101-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, first, I must declare several interests. At present, I am president of BALPA and have been so since about 1980. I have also been a Minister for aviation and the European Commissioner for transport and the environment. In all those positions, the most important feature is balance. We have not heard that spoken of today. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that the Bill represented a confused approach&#151;and he nods&#151;but that applies to every civil aviation Bill and it cannot be otherwise. I go back a long way to when I entered the House in 1970 and I cannot think of a situation where a civil aviation Bill has been other than that.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>My noble friend was right to emphasise the contribution which the airline industry makes to the economy. It is often insufficiently appreciated in terms of the generation of wealth and employment, both direct and indirect, and of benefits to the public in enhanced leisure and business opportunities.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>On the other hand, while recognising those immense benefits we cannot ignore or neglect the environmental impact. Therefore, as I said at the beginning, it is vital that we strike a balance between the real problems confronting those on the ground and the aircraft industry. If we take noise, for example, while there is no doubt that today&#039;s jets are less noisy than their predecessors, those living under or near flight paths still suffer. As we have heard from various speakers, they are kept awake at night and disturbed by day. It is of little comfort to them to be informed that the situation was even worse in the past and they rightly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_151"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

call for more action. There is a vital need for ongoing research to develop still quieter aircraft using designated and non-designated airports alike.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>So it is a question of balance, which the Bill seeks to achieve. There has to be a sensible environmental policy to protect people, coupled with the reasonable assurance that airlines can continue to operate from our national airports and not for some to be tempted to desert them in favour of a new home&#151;or perhaps mirage would be a more accurate term&#151;on the Continent.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>This Bill encompasses proposals to deal with salient environmental concerns with regard to noise and other forms of pollution. It brings in reasonable regulations to control other aspects of the industry providing for appropriate penalties where breaches occur. Local authorities and local communities have important roles in encouraging best practice and consultation in my view is the key.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Airports&#039; residential neighbours, airport workers, suppliers of services and trade unions should all be involved and given a hearing. Out of that&#151;I hope&#151;constructive dialogue, conflict and tension may be reduced and new beneficial effects emerge. In this spirit, a memorandum of understanding was signed last March between the Civil Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Executive. Under it, both bodies are committed to close co-operation and a guidance on good practice was drawn up. Unfortunately, the guidance to consult with employees does not extend to the CAA&#039;s responsibility for the health and safety of crews when they are on the aircraft&#151;a point I tried to make in an intervention on my noble friend.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>There are work at height regulations in force but they do not include some matters of crucial concern related to flying conditions. Therefore, pilots are seeking an extension of this guidance so that their expertise and professionalism can be drawn on to advise on occupational health and safety matters, such as cockpit design, ergonomic operations, training of crews in identifying hazards&#151;for example, contaminated cabin air&#151;and so on. Therefore, they believe that the guidance should include an imperative to consult about onboard issues as well as those external to the aircraft. That would also be welcomed by the operators. Pilots&#039; contributions, borne out of experience, could undoubtedly benefit crews and passengers alike. Therefore, while pilots broadly support the Bill, an amendment introduced in Committee into Clause 7 on health and safety to address the anomaly to which I have alluded would be worth while.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I refer to this now to pray in aid the necessity of close consultation and co-operation, above all with the industry&#039;s employees, but not confined to them. This matter is a question of health on board, but by addressing all concerns in a meaningful way, we can improve the health of the airline industry as a whole.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The Government have endeavoured to foresee the possibilities of sustainable aviation up to 2030 in the White Paper introduced by them, <i>The Future of Air <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_152"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 152</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Transport</i>. The Government cannot anticipate all the problems but, in my view, they have done their level best. Subject to what I said and to planning permission, plans have been set out for all the airports including a second runway at Stansted by 2012; perhaps a third runway at Heathrow; maybe a new runway at Gatwick after 2019; a second runway at Edinburgh; and the development of Manchester, Glasgow and other regional airports. All these plans are vitally important but consultation is vital in every respect.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>There are three other matters that, although they are, understandably, not specifically mentioned in the Bill, are highly germane to it. The first is purely British. Today it was announced by BAA that there is to be a large number of redundancies at London airports. Can my noble friend enlarge on that? When will they take effect? Who will be the probable victims? What effect will they have on British aviation? What consultation is likely to take place with the people who are going to be affected or their trade union representatives?
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Then there are the issues of climate change and global warming. The United States, in particular, is being somewhat cavalier about the threats that are posed thereby. It has been joined by a few other countries. They all display selfishness and myopia in an extreme degree. We have obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights that are of huge importance to millions, nay, billions, of people. The Government propose to tackle these issues on the world stage. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will be able to enlarge on this in his closing remarks. Precisely how will the Government go about this? In particular, how do they envisage that the issue of emission trading, with its acknowledged opportunities, will be dealt with?
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>This is a sensible Bill. I hope that it will be possible to bridge the differences which have been voiced in the House and, more particularly, by the organisations outside. I hope also that we will be able to amend Bill if changing circumstances demand this. But all in all the Government should be proud of what they have done and I fully support the Bill.

<a name="51101-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the Aviation Environment Federation. As noble Lords have said, there are some good elements in the Bill. I was interested to hear the Minister talk about aviation being a gateway to the world and that it produces wonderful travel opportunities. That is an extension of the Government&#039;s long-held view that they should predict and produce for the needs of air passengers and freight while not doing the same for road, rail or any other surface mode. Maritime does not come into it because we have not yet had a strategy on that. I worry, as other noble Lords have said, that we continue to pay lip service to the problem of emissions and Kyoto, but with the terrible proviso&#151;so long as it does not hurt anybody and does not cause anybody to change his behaviour. As my noble friend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_153"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Faulkner said, I am afraid that in order to do good it will have to probably hurt and cause a behavioural change.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I am a member of the European Energy and Transport Forum. Earlier this year it produced a report on taxation of aviation. Emissions trading came into that report. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;The scope of any [emissions trading] scheme must include all flights to and from EU airports, but domestic and external, as well as flights over EU airspace. If emissions trading rather than a fuel tax is chosen as the preferred route, this can only be achieved by severely limiting the free &#039;allowances&#039; allowed to airlines at the start of the scheme&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I suspect&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, alluded to this&#151;airlines are very keen on emissions trading because they will get this free start. So, any trading will probably only affect any increase in the traffic that they create. I do not think that is its objective. The Energy and Transport Forum concluded that in order to be effective for air to pay the full cost of the damage it imposes, there should be a charge of something like &#163;50 per 1,000 kilometres passenger journey or about &#163;200 per 1,000 tonne kilometres of freight.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>So the emissions trading scheme needs to be taken forward but the free ride to start off with is not an option; and, I am afraid, if we are to meet our Kyoto targets, as other noble Lords have said, this must hurt. If it causes some passengers and some freight&#151;and I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group&#151;to transfer to rail, or even road for short distances, because the emissions will be less, then surely we should accept that price.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Turning to the problems of noise, the Minister said that the Bill would be positive for those who live around airports. I have not found that. Uncertainty about the amount and the level of noise is hardly positive, as many noble Lords have said. I shall not repeat a load of briefings from different people about noise, but I believe that there is a serious problem about how you measure noise. The method is crucial to how it affects people, in particular this quota system, which I am not sure works very well.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I have a 35-page copy of the judgment from the Queen&#039;s Bench Division in 1993 of <i>R</i> v <i>Secretary of State for Transport ex p. LB Richmond and others</i> where the judge says that the quota count system is &quot;wholly unreal&quot; and seeks to bamboozle residents into thinking that more night flights somehow equals less noise and less sleep disturbance, which, the judge says, is a counter-intuitive proposition.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>I will not go on any more. This is something that we can explore in Committee with some interest but it is clearly a serious situation. If we think it is just going to apply to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted today, we can be quite sure that in the future it will be extended to other airports. In that context, I remember a press cutting about concern by residents around Coventry airport about noise in the last few months. Apparently Coventry airport has such a small terminal building that it does not need planning permission to operate as one so they can therefore make as much noise as they like there. I probably have not paraphrased it correctly but it is something that we have got to be careful <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_154"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about: new airstrips coming up with a small portakabin as a terminal and they can suddenly run flights all night.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Finally, this Bill provides the opportunity of doing something which I do not think is in it at the moment, which is the suggestion that it is time that the air industry funded surface access to its airports, with a view to reducing the number of cars that are used&#151;whether by passengers or workers at the airport. We all remember the long, drawn-out Heathrow Terminal 5 inquiry where we were told that the Heathrow Express was going to be extended and that there would be one or two more bus services. But for such an enormous development at Heathrow it should have been a requirement for the rail connection to have been extended to Staines and back to wherever the Staines line goes to&#151;either Waterloo, Ascot, Reading or anywhere else&#151;and also for a line to be added which could then extend back on to the Great Western to Reading. There is an enormous catchment area there of customers for the air and workers so why was the extension of these rail networks not part of the conditions attached to the giving of planning permission? They are absolutely essential. The traffic jams around Heathrow, even before the opening of Terminal 5, are enormous and what it will be like once it has opened heaven only knows. The same applies to Stansted.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We need some legislation on this. Otherwise we are relying on individual public inquiries and the opinions of the inspectors to put on conditions. There is a precedent for this. In the railway White Paper of 2004, the Government made it plain that on road and rail connections to new ports developments, the port developer would have to contribute to the cost of such developments; they are putting that into practice on some of the subsequent decisions on planning applications. That is not altogether satisfactory but at least it is in the White Paper. We should make something a bit stronger in the air industry so that with any increase in the number of passengers or planes going through an airport it is required that the number of cars going to the airport is not increased&#151;I refer to both congestion and emissions.
</p>

<a name="51101-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>In conclusion, I welcome bits of this Bill and I welcome the opportunity for looking at other issues that might conveniently fit into this Bill during Committee and thereafter. I look forward to my noble friend&#039;s response.

<a name="51101-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Leigh: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a director of Manchester Airports Group, which has been mentioned on numerous occasions today. I was appointed by the Greater Manchester local authorities, as the airport company is still publicly owned. Noble Lords will not be surprised, therefore, that broadly I welcome the Bill as I did the White Paper <i>The Future of Air Transport</i>.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Without a successful, growing air transport industry, this country&#039;s economic prospects would be limited. If we are to continue to lead in the knowledge <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_155"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

economy, improved connectivity is vital. The economic impact of areas where airports are located is well documented. Direct employment is probably at a ratio of 1,000 jobs per million-passenger throughput, and indirect jobs come through tourism, increased trade and indirect investment. I share some of the concerns expressed about climate change and sustainability, but aviation can become more sustainable. We cannot simply put a brake on aviation development in the UK because the impact on the country would be severe.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>As airport operators we recognise that there are environmental and other disadvantages for those who live near airports, and wish to minimise the impact of airports as bad neighbours. All airports should work with their airlines and local communities to reduce that impact. The Bill&#039;s powers will help to concentrate minds on the matter. In Manchester we have always tried to be at the leading edge in improving our environment and working with the community. We have put money into soundproofing schemes quite a way from the airport and we have continued those schemes as we have taken over other airports, particularly Nottingham East Midlands.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>At our two main airports, Manchester and Nottingham East Midlands, we are carrying out three of the four activities that the Bill will allow airports to do. We fine aircraft that exceed the noise limits that we set. We welcome debate about how we can properly define it. We are very happy at the idea of moving around monitoring arrangements. I was surprised that noble Lords seemed to think that the CAA is an independent body that can monitor aviation noise. The CAA is responsible for the allocation of air space, which has as much to do with aviation noise as the location of airports. We have had quite a dispute in Nottingham East Midlands airport because the CAA, acting outwith its powers, has decided to reallocate air space, creating new areas of noise. The CAA is as guilty of noise as airports; therefore it would not be an independent operator.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>We have voluntary schemes to incentivise aircraft to keep on track. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, seemed to doubt whether those schemes worked, but with over 95 per cent of aircraft keeping to the tracks agreed with the airports and the CAA, we are doing quite a good job. There are always reasons why aircraft may go off track; they may be to do with safety and other factors.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>We monitor air quality around the airport. We support aviation&#039;s inclusion in the emissions trading scheme. We do not charge penalties at the moment, but, given the powers in the Bill, I think that we will review that. As noble Lords have said, a substantial proportion of emissions around airports come, not from aircraft, but from people gaining access to the airport. It is therefore important that airports concern themselves with public transport. As an airport company we have contributed to the delivery of a new mainline rail link to Manchester airport and will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_156"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contribute to the metrolink connection to the airport. We hope that the Government will sustain their contribution also.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I am pleased at what has been achieved at Manchester and Nottingham East Midlands airports by voluntary activity. I welcome the Minister&#039;s comments that a lot has been achieved through voluntary arrangements, and that much of the Bill may be used just as a last resort if those arrangements do not work.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I also declare an interest in Clause 5. On two previous occasions, I tried to table an amendment introducing that clause to government legislation. The noble Lord said that the provision was introduced in the 1986 Act solely to try to make local authorities privatise their airports. We were restricted on what we could do and on what we could borrow. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, wondered how Stansted would pay for a second runway. Manchester managed to pay for a second runway from its own resources as the company did not have access to public borrowing, so it can be done.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>In July 2000, I tried to add that clause to a transport Bill, but I was told that it was more appropriate to a local government Bill. When I introduced it in the Local Government Bill in June 2000, in his own inimitable style, my noble friend Lord Rooker expressed sympathy at my predicament but could not agree to its inclusion in his Bill. He asked me to withdraw it and promised that, when a suitable opportunity occurred, the Government would include it. Off message, he promised that that was a firm commitment, so I am pleased that three and a half years later, the Government have done it.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>It means that airports like Manchester will be able to do the same as other airports, such as Heathrow, and the British Airports Authority. It will give us a level playing field. I would have preferred a much simpler clause saying, &quot;Get rid of Section 17(4) of the Airports Act 1986&quot;, but I understand the Government&#039;s intention. I welcome the opportunity to discuss with interested parties the regulations that are needed. They need to be as clear and as wide as possible in order to allow those airports to have the same freedom as other airports. I hope that the Minister will assure me that I am not just being paranoid. Under Clause 5(3)&#151;new Section 17A(1)&#151;the word &quot;may&quot; is used rather than the word &quot;shall&quot; in terms of introducing regulations. I am sure that that will be dealt with.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Finally, on a totally different point, I am fascinated by the language in the Bill, which describes airports as aerodromes. The <i>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i>, defines an aerodrome in a literal sense as a course for the use of flying machines, which is amplified by saying that it is attractive level ground from which aeroplanes or airships can start. The earliest recorded use is 1902. Louis Bl&#233;riot probably took off from an aerodrome, as did Biggles. Gatwick would have been an aerodrome when it was a flying school. I wonder whether we can describe Heathrow, Gatwick today or Manchester as aerodromes. They are complex transport <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interchanges. The word &quot;airport&quot; is a simple, modern one. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s assurance that, in line with the Government&#039;s policy of simple, plain English that we can understand, they will bring forward amendments to replace the word &quot;aerodromes&quot; with &quot;airports&quot;.

<a name="51101-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, I have an interest to declare as the campaign director of Future Heathrow, which is a coalition of trade unions, airlines, businesses and professional organisations. I also have another interest to declare: I am a long-term resident of west London and for 30 years have lived under the flight paths of Heathrow. Like everyone else, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s when Trident and Concorde were flying, we would have closed the airport the next morning if, and only if, personal interests about noise were put above the prosperity of the area. Most of us who live in west London or, I suspect, near most airports know that they are amazing generators of wealth, prosperity and jobs. Heathrow employs 70,000 people, and probably well over 100,000 indirectly. If it ceases to be a hub airport, we will pay a terrible price in west London and the Heathrow region, but the country will also pay a high price. So we need to get that right.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I am not here to speak predominantly about that issue. I am here to speak about the Bill, which I welcome, and to raise a couple of issues in the debate. Obviously, I will not ignore the importance of noise and so forth, because I suffer that and I know what it means, but it is important that people understand the balance. As an MP, people used to write to me and I would write back saying, &quot;Yes, noise is a problem, but there are advantages. Would you kindly tell me how many times you have flown this year?&quot;. It is amazing how many people would not reply. That is like people who say, &quot;I am fed up with the traffic jams. I have just got back from driving my kids to school, and it was horrendous&quot;. We have to address that. There is a problem about how people perceive their own behaviour in relation to a wider social economic problem.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I do not want to turn to the Bill before I address the really big issue of climate change, which several noble Lords have addressed. It is so enormous that we cannot ignore it. In the nightmare scenario of climate change, it will not be a matter of discouraging people from flying or driving. If scientific evidence evolves in the coming years that is so serious as to suggest really drastic action, people will be stopped from flying, driving and doing many of the things that they take for granted in our society. Frankly, in those circumstances, the economic consequences would be so severe that it is difficult to imagine what our society would look like. That is the nightmare scenario and let us not ignore it, because it could become real.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The other way of looking at the problem, which we can do at the moment, is to say that the evidence is alarming and we had better start bearing down on carbon emissions generally, which means that we have to address that issue across a very wide field. That is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_158"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not totally new. Indeed, I rather na-vely wrote about the issue in my first ever election address as a prospective councillor, which must have been about 1960. It was the only election that I ever lost, so it was very good training. I complained about the dangers of population growth and what that meant for the world. I am sure that one of the reasons that I was rejected was that local residents thought that having me in the town hall trying to impose limits on population growth might have implications for the locality that they had not planned from their local councillor. I am sure that they were quite right in rejecting my candidature at that stage. How we provide standards of living for large numbers of people without polluting our environment has always been a difficulty. It is not a new problem; it goes back a long way, but is now particularly serious.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>If we want to bear down on carbon emissions, many of the provisions in the Bill are very good and I welcome them. Charging extra for aircraft that are particularly dirty is important, but we also need to understand that modern airports and aircraft actually reduce emissions as they are developed. I know that that does not answer the question of more people and more aircraft flying, but it does mean that the aircraft industry, which is as aware of this problem as anyone sitting here today, knows that it has to bear down on noise and pollution. It is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that technology and science are part of the answer to that problem.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I am not complaining about what is in the Bill, but I have a suggestion for my friend on the government Benches about something else to include in it. A few months ago, a British company, Arup, a developer and designer, won the award to design and build a city for 1 million people in China&#151;the first city designed to be carbon neutral. The Minister should consider a provision to require airports to operate on a carbon neutral basis on the ground. They cannot do that in terms of aircraft emissions, because we do not have an alternative to the propulsion fuels for aircraft, but we do have biodiesel for all vehicles on the ground, the opportunity to tow rather than taxi aircraft and a number of opportunities to design the buildings to be carbon-neutral.

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I know that the Minister takes global warming seriously like the rest of us, but the way to bear down on this problem is to use every department of state and private company to bear down on carbon emissions. Simply pleading with people not to fly or drive will not work. People do not behave like that. Things will only happen in a crisis and heaven forbid that we get into that situation. Something could be included in the Bill&#151;probably in Clause 5&#151;where the Minister could consider a requirement on airport operators to impose an aim of achieving carbon neutrality on the non-aircraft operations of the airfield&#151;or aerodrome, to go back to the days of Biggles, when I am sure pollution was significantly less, unless he was machine-gunning you.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The issues are profoundly important on the wider level, but this Bill is a small but significant step in the right direction. As a west London resident who was an <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

MP for the area for 26 years, I am inevitably concerned. I do not want to see areas that depend on major airports go down the tubes. I am particularly worried that Heathrow is in decline relative to major continental airports. It has already been overtaken by Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam and it will be overtaken shortly by Milan, Munich, Rome and Madrid. That process will continue, unless Heathrow gets its third short runway. So I make no apologies for my belief that we must have that third, short runway. That does not mean to say that I want it done in a way that ignores the noise problems or emissions problems or whatever. We do not do it that way. My view is that, actually, at the moment Heathrow is a pretty unpleasant experience as an airport. We could make it infinitely better.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>One of the things that we need to get better in this country is the way that local authorities work together with airports, to stop seeing airports as problems and to start to see them as possibilities: what they provide in terms of employment, what they provide in terms of prosperity, what they provide in terms of training and education for young people. Heaven knows what would happen to many of the high-tech jobs in my area if Heathrow became a point-to-point airport. We would probably lose about 20,000 jobs. If we had to produce another hub airport somewhere else to replace Heathrow, and Heathrow disappeared entirely, which is not totally impossible, the consequences would be horrific. That is why I have often made the analogy with the London docks. I was one of the people stupid enough to say that the London docks would never close, that no one would want to go to Felixstowe or Rotterdam. They did, they went and 50,000 jobs went with them. East London has only recently recovered.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>People need to be careful about this issue overall. My argument is a plea to the Minister. Will the Government include in the Bill a provision requiring airports to operate towards a carbon-neutral basis on the ground? There is no reason why we cannot do that. It would send out a strong signal that we are serious about the issue and at the same time recognise that the threat from the continental airports to places like Heathrow is enormous. People do not know it, but you can fly to far more British regional cities from Amsterdam and Paris than you can from London&#039;s Heathrow: 21 from Amsterdam; 19 from Paris; and just nine from Heathrow. If you want to scare yourself about this, go home tonight and, when you type into your computer, book yourself a ticket somewhere. Try to book a ticket from Newcastle to Tokyo or from Edinburgh to Beijing&#151;places that have links, like with the Toyota car plant or the medical school. You used to go via Heathrow. Now you go via Amsterdam and Paris.
</p>

<a name="51101-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>That will go on very dramatically. People who say to me that Heathrow is safe and that Heathrow will always be there are saying exactly what I said about the London docks. It is a dangerous complacency. We need to make sure that local authorities and airports work together to develop airports in as sustainable a <br>&nbsp;<br>

manner as possible. If we include a carbon-neutral provision in the Bill, I say to the Minister that many people will remember him as one of the people who took a very important step on the road to sustainability for air travel.

<a name="51101-12_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b>  My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Soley, has been most eloquent about carbon neutrality at airports and, on these Benches, we do not disagree with him.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>This transport Bill makes some modest changes to the air transport industry and for its passengers, and may reduce the burden on those who must live within the vicinity of airports. My noble friend Lord Bradshaw brought, I think, five points to our debate. The first was the methodology crisis between noise limits by number and noise by quota. He then referred to tranquil areas and the problem of track keeping. He mentioned the need for logarithmic acceleration in fines for decibel use. He asked whether there were perverse incentives buried within the EU emissions trading scheme. He also hoped that airport energy on the surface could be reduced, bearing in mind that half of all the emissions produced are produced on the ground.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>The first four clauses deal with pollution issues, particularly at airports&#151;or, more quaintly, aerodromes. I wonder whether that word includes air strips, or is an air strip smaller than an aerodrome? The trend is towards encouraging more efficient aircraft, which make less noise and less vibration and emit less pollution from the engines. Airlines will have to weigh up the merits of spending more on newer aircraft&#151;presumably more efficient aircraft&#151;or paying higher airport charges. The long-term effect will be to shunt older but still serviceable aircraft on to new routes to new emerging airports&#151;for example, Ryanair&#039;s possible exploration of an airport at Errol&#151;or, even more hypocritically, to shunt these older aircraft into the second and third world.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>If air transport creates atmospheric pollution, air pollution and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports, and road traffic pollution and congestion, then the Bill does nothing about atmospheric pollution and road network problems. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, reminded us of the problems caused by &quot;predict and provide&quot;, although it is a frightfully nice policy.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I suspect that new Section 38C(3)(b) will attract interest in the vicinity of many airports, none more so than in Aberdeen where a surprisingly early close to night flying has been in force for many years. I believe that powers to do that in Scotland would be devolved to Scottish Ministers.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>In retrospect, I was brought up to believe that aircraft noise went with the prosperity which a nearby airport generated. Perhaps that attitude is changing. Certainly the noble Lord, Lord Soley, emphasises the economic importance of airports such as Heathrow.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Flather, spoke extensively about the outer flight path and in particular the problems at Windsor. I certainly admit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_161"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that when I was a schoolboy at Eton there were occasions when aircraft were taking off in a particular direction when everything came to a halt for about four minutes&#151;often quite a welcome four minutes. I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that the ever-larger aircraft may well arrive early and will need to be allowed to land ahead of schedule, and that may mean in the early morning. While flying to and from Iceland during the Recess, I noticed that Icelandair flies all its European routes from Keflavik in the early morning, albeit that it is an established part of a Reykjavik short break that you have to catch the airport bus at 5 am.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Bill does nothing to deal with the proper taxation of aviation fuel. Although air passenger duty does act as a poor substitute, it fails to tax properly because it taxes passengers rather than airplane movements. It does not, therefore, tax largely empty aircraft.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Clause 5 brings some liberalisation to airports owned by local authorities in England and Wales. Presumably that will allow them not only to sell services but also allow retailing at those airports, which in turn may make the financing of the airport easier. I suspect that such airports will end up with larger terminal buildings, larger car parks and more local road congestion. However, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, will be satisfied with Clause 5.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>In Clause 6, I am not at all surprised that the Secretary of State wants to dump the hassle of appeals over route licences. The failure of previous Secretaries of State, for example, to arrange for the city of Inverness, and hence the Highlands and Islands, to have a slot at Heathrow suggests that the appeal process did not work anyway. Is the Minister satisfied that airlines will not find other routes for appealing against CAA decisions? Is the Secretary of State not involved in the appointment of the CAA?
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Clause 7 has drawn interest from the House, and in particular from my noble kinsman the noble Countess, Lady Mar. She was, among other matters, concerned about the contamination of cabin and, even more importantly, flight deck air supply. That clearly needs further examination. There is also a real issue of DVT here for passengers. The Bill quite rightly has a clause attempting to deal with health issues for passengers and crew. I suspect that long-haul flights will be reduced by the addition of stopovers. That will add to the expense of flying and create more airport air and noise pollution. It may well lead to more people being banned from flying on medical grounds.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Clause 8 seems eminently sensible, provided that it leads to a comprehensive upgrade of the documentation and deletion of all the outdated regulations. Clause 9 brings us to the mildly controversial Air Travel Trust fund in place of the now partial ATOL arrangements. There must be no doubt that airline operators within a deregulated, free enterprise market will on occasion go bust and that some of their customers will be stranded away from home or be unable to fly at virtually the last minute. The question is whether airline operators should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_162"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provide in advance a bond to rescue their passengers in the event of going bust, or whether every air passenger should pay into a fund to rescue those who fly with financially dodgy airlines. That payment would presumably be made by the airline. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, favoured the &#163;1 levy.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>That reminds me of the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, which come into force in 2007 and will require all manufacturers to pay for the scrapping of their vehicles. While mass-produced cars generally go for scrapping after 12 to 14 years, cars such as Rolls-Royce and Morgan are rebuilt endlessly and do not get scrapped. Those two manufacturers would probably regard such a regulation as unfair. If the context were that it was desirable to create more cheap flights, the air travel fund would be the right way to go. But on these Benches we believe that air travel creates significant pollution and congestion and does not desperately need to be expanded willy-nilly, particularly for leisure purposes. Hence we would prefer airlines to provide their own funding for bankruptcy.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The Bill will need thorough scrutiny in Grand Committee. That is a suitable place in which to ensure that it will deliver the sensible proposals that it makes.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51101-12_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I suppose that I should join the noble Lord, Lord Soley, in declaring the fact that I live under quite a few airplanes in West London. My speech ought to be received against that background&#151;not to say that I am biased.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I do not suppose that I need to point out to the Minister that the Bill has been received with rather muted enthusiasm both here and in the other place. But it has enabled us to have a pretty wide-ranging, if not always totally relevant, debate. As practically every speaker has drawn attention to, there is no doubt that aircraft noise is becoming one of the most serious complaints of residents within miles of any airport. With new airports being established and increased use of others, it has been estimated that in the very near future nowhere in the United Kingdom, not even the Outer Hebrides, will be without ambient noise. The sound of aircraft will be audible everywhere. We are a small island in flying terms.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In London, the inquiry into the fifth terminal was beleaguered by such concerns about noise. As my noble friend Lady Flather said, the surrounding boroughs are still incandescent at the effect of night flights and the possibility that they may be deregulated. Anyone who lives anywhere near the descent or approach path of airlines is affected. It is interesting that although the Government are strengthening the central control on noise at the three London airports, control elsewhere is to be left to the discretion of the other airports, which can decide for themselves whether to implement sanctions against companies that do not have appropriate noise reductions. Since the policies already exist, and the airports can apply sanctions to the noise, it can surely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_163"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be only the last throw to make it a statutory possible requirement. The noble Lord, Lord Soley, is of course correct that there are economic and environmental impacts associated with airports, and we should not ignore those. But noise is one of the major problems associated with airports, and it is sensible for everybody to look forward to see how it can be reduced so that we maintain the economic viability of airports in the future.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to emissions. The discharge of emissions into the atmosphere is of particular concern because of their effect on global warming. The increasing number of airplanes in the upper atmosphere can scarcely be addressed if emission control is left to the future prospect of lower emissions. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, we accept that fundamental decisions will have to be made about the liberalisation and long-term growth of air traffic.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a> Perhaps the Minister can tell us what discussions have taken place during the EU presidency, a point raised by a couple of noble Lords. In particular, what proposals were discussed on aviation emissions trading? Mr Darling, the Secretary of State, said that it was something that the presidency would deal with. Does the Minister have any news on whether those discussions have been successful?
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a> The Bill is silent on any review of compensation for those who are affected by both noise and emissions. We believe that compensation should be more generous and we will be looking into that at further stages. We will also want to test the local airport consultative arrangements and their effectiveness. As has also been said, local authorities have a major role to play in how their local airports operate and the issue of noise there.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a> As I understand it, the air travel fund is bust and is currently being supported by the Government. However, it is clearly an important fund as it backs up the ATOL system on which&#151;as noble Lords said&#151;passengers do rely. I am not sure how many passengers who believe they have ATOL security and rely on it appreciate that support for it continues only as a gesture of the Government. It remains a significant protection. During our consideration we will need to test the best way of ensuring that, with these liberated air travel arrangements, there is appropriate security for passengers and travellers.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a> Clause 7 and the health issue were significantly and succinctly referred to by the noble Countess, Lady Mar, who has enormous experience. The health of passengers is of great importance as the amount of air travel undertaken increases. There is still a sizeable question about whether the air within aircraft, in the cabin, is of suitable quality. There have been many discussions on the issue, and I remember a Health Select Committee on the subject in this House. Concerns were raised then and are still being raised that the air quality is inadequate to support passengers. There is also&#151;and this becomes increasingly relevant&#151;the danger of the spread of infection if the air quality is insufficient. At the very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_164"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

least, poor air quality makes travelling unpleasant. But the noble Countess has extended those concerns to describe the danger to crew as well as passengers.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>To what extent will Clause 7 cover any of those aspects, or will there be restrictions on what the clause means? Perhaps it will be restricted to enabling the spraying of the inside of cabins, to prevent infection when planes land. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, drew attention to the valuable role that can be played by pilots, for example, in the design of such systems. After all, they are not only the ones who experience them most; they are the people who have to deal with dangers when they arise. If there is inadequate or poisoned air quality, there is concern for them.
</p>

<a name="51101-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Soley, raised some interesting points about emission controls on the ground, but rightly drew an analogy with people refusing to stop driving. People will not stop flying or driving. It appears that technology needs to catch up with the concerns of those who will give up neither their planes nor their cars. Why should they? However, I am sure that technological developments will affect in future everything that we have talked about. I hope that the Bill is now wide enough for us to be able to look a little further into the future when we discuss it in Committee.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="51101-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have participated in the debate. It has given us great food for thought, which we will digest more fully in Committee on the detailed points, of which there are a large number. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I am not able, in what is inevitably a limited speech, to enter into every detail raised this afternoon. Many of them are important Committee points that we will have the chance to discuss fully. I want to deal with the broader issues, particularly as some of them have been raised in sharp profile in the debate.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The aviation industry is a success story. Millions of our fellow citizens benefit from that success. Large numbers of them who work in the industry benefit in terms of their livelihoods, but increased air travel has brought great benefits to many. I bear in mind the point made wisely by my noble friend Lord Soley, which is that those in favour of restriction for many ought really to stand up and say whether they are in favour of restriction for themselves. We all recognise that the demand for air travel is a reflection of a good that people wish to consume. That cannot be unlimited, of course, or we could easily arrive at a situation in which vast areas of our country were subject to such intolerable conditions on the ground that we would have reduced the quality of life for our fellow citizens. Many of them might not have had the benefits of air travel but were suffering the consequences of uncontrolled expansion, so we have to strike a balance.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The debate has reflected the extent to which that balance is inevitably difficult to achieve, but let me indicate to the House that the Government are not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_165"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

following a policy of &quot;predict and provide&quot;, the phrase certainly used by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. That is not the case at all. However, we can measure expectations of increased opportunity for air travel and pressure for that, which we are obliged to meet so far as we are able, consonant with having due regard to the interests of those who live near airports and whose case was so ably deployed by a number of speakers. I want to emphasise that the Bill is in broad terms there to strike a balance between those competing interests. We have a great deal of work to do on aircraft emissions and noise levels; that is why I am pleased to report to the House, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that during our presidency of the European Community, we are making progress on an emissions scheme. We look forward to some crucial meetings over the next few weeks that relate to that scheme. We all recognise that there is no way in which we can solve the problem on the basis of a UK unilateral position alone.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Noise is the other great detrimental feature of airport expansion. I should say <i>en passant</i> that I will use the word &quot;airport&quot;. My noble friend Lord Smith upbraided me for the archaic use of &quot;aerodrome&quot; in the Bill. Part of the measure reforms and refers to the 1982 Act, when aerodromes existed and the terminology was used more frequently. We are therefore somewhat stuck with the fact that we have to refer to the words and phrases in that Act, or it would cause confusion about what we were reforming. He is right; I hope that we will take the House beyond the land of Biggles and other heroes of the 1940s and into the challenges of the 21st century.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>In doing that, airport noise is of great importance. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, did not have too many constructive moments. He is against the expansion of Stansted&#151;surprise, surprise. It is wonderful how the Opposition can take up a position like that; they might find it more difficult if they tried to meet demands for expansion in this country. We are concerned about the fact that expansion should be limited to specific areas of the country. The great danger&#151;it would be much more detrimental to the wider community&#151;would be if we went in for a vast proliferation of fresh airfields. Unless he is arguing that, under a future Conservative administration&#151;if that is not an inconceivable thought for the House to accept at this stage&#151;there would be no expansion of air travel at all, he has to replace the expansion of Stansted with some other concept. However, in one of his constructive moments&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="51101-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, one accepts that there is a large runway at Stansted, and that 25 million passengers a year go through it. It would be possible to have 40 million passengers a year on that runway. Therefore, the policy that I, my party and a lot of other people support is that there could be maximum use of that runway. I repeat what my noble friend Lady Hanham said&#151;we have to consider the long-term and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_166"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continuing expansion of air travel. However, the next Conservative government, led by David Cameron, will have to address that point.

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="51101-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I never thought that I would accuse an opposition spokesman of being more farsighted than myself, but here we have the clearest evidence that we already know the result of a particular election. We wonder why one candidate does not pack his bags and go home at this point if it has already been decided in the inner councils of the Conservative Party that that should be the result.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>On the more general point, I assure the noble Lord that, unless he wants to limit expansion significantly, his argument that you put more pressure on a single runway is either a limiting factor or not. If it is not a limiting factor there is no gain so far as the environment is concerned. If it is a limiting factor he has to give some illustration of how he wants to limit demand in those terms. We are concerned to meet areas of demand consonant with making sure that the effects on those who live near airports are minimised. That is why&#151;I was going on to my constructive point&#151;
</p>

<a name="51101-13_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, let me finish my constructive point, lest it be thought by the Conservative Front Bench spokesman that I am incapable of making a constructive point. He is right that we need to consider the question of how we measure noise. There may be a constructive thought in that we need to revisit the measurement of noise, which after all has obtained for more than 20 to 30 years. In this new day and age we may need something more sophisticated that is more accurate as regards the impact of noise on the community. I accept the noble Lord&#039;s challenge and will perhaps explore aspects of that in Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="51101-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, on the question of forecasts on Stansted, does my noble friend accept that air travel, like any other transport industry, should bear the full costs of the damage that it does to the environment? That could be by taxation or some other means of increasing the cost of fuel. Surely the higher charges involved will affect the forecast growth of the industry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="51101-13_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I accept that in principle. The measure is premised on the assumption that the industry bears its external costs, which relates to the environment and the issues that have been outlined in today&#039;s discussion. How far that would significantly reduce the demand for air travel is an interesting point. These are challenging issues.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Once again I call in aid my noble friend Lord Soley, whom I am delighted to have heard in this House. I heard him often in the other place with great pleasure. We should not pretend that we are in some protected <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_167"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

economic environment where we can mess about with airports and the aviation industry, have throwaway lines on restrictions without careful thought, or not be mindful of the fact that it is an intensely competitive industry. Others are poised to take advantage of weaknesses in our provision. It might not relieve the number of flights that appear in the United Kingdom; it just means that others may be the chief beneficiaries in an economic sense, or it may bring benefits to those on the ground.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The other point that I want to pick up from the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is that I can assure the House that resources gained from charging airlines should be devoted to the local community. The noble Lord mentioned a golf course, which may or may not commend itself to the local community. Let me make the obvious point, to which my noble friend Lord Smith will testify, that if you are running an airport and meeting the challenges of local people by constantly consulting them about the environment, you will certainly find out where they want the resources spent from any gains that you may have made. We do not have to worry unduly about how &quot;airport managers&quot;&#151;a phrase that was expressed in rather disparaging terms&#151;or the industry will let the community down. It will be responsible about consulting on the distribution of resources.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said about tranquil areas, which are all too few. Of course, there is no legislative definition of a tranquil area. I do not know a tranquil area over which aircraft do not fly. If aircraft fly high enough, they do not disturb the area, but the noble Lord will recognise that we do not have such a concept. Not even our national parks, which are tranquil areas, are defined upwards in that way.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I recognise, of course, that aircraft movements and aircraft noise threaten the environment not just in the immediate vicinity of airports. We must examine the issue with the greatest of care. I accept that I will be pressed in Committee about how we will go about it. Suffice to say that in introducing the Bill I was concerned about achieving a balance. We intend to be forthright about ensuring that the industry meets its external costs, and has proper regard to both noise and pollution.
</p>

<a name="51101-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, raised the important issue of health, as did my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis who was very supportive in his speech. I was grateful for that, given his long experience in the industry, and his present role as president of BALPA. Of course, we are concerned about contaminated air issues, which is why I responded with the greatest of care to the Written Question that the noble Countess addressed to me. Airline pilots and cabin crew are as one with the Government in their interest in ensuring that air is not contaminated and that aircraft are safe to fly and work in and to pilot. That is of the greatest importance. There have been limited cases of illness in aircraft, but that does not alter the importance of our paying due regard to the issue. It will be recognised within the <br>&nbsp;<br>

framework of the Bill that we are addressing health issues. It is an important point that I hope will be developed in Committee. In broad terms, I want to say how important the issue is regarded by the Government.

</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51101-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, if my noble friend will forgive me I am trying to work within fairly strict time limits, and I have an awful lot to cover.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I accept what my noble friend Lord Faulkner said that the best way of solving the problem of noise is to reduce the number of aircraft movements and the demand for air travel. I hear his point, which no doubt he will express with great force in Committee. The evidence runs strongly against him. It is not an easy case to argue, and he is not on the winning side at present, although he may anticipate that the balance will change and that our fellow citizens will put such a high priority on improving environments close to airports that they will reduce their demand for air travel. At present, that is as likely as large numbers of our fellow citizens voluntarily giving up their car use. That is happening to a limited degree, but it would be a foolish government that put a great deal of stock by that concept of reduction of opportunity.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Flather, also emphasised the aspects of noise and night flights, in particular. That is a crucial issue in the Bill, and I hope to discuss those matters with her further. My noble friend Lady McIntosh indicated that I adopted a courteous response to her speeches. I do, but that does not make them any more comfortable to listen to, because she articulates in the strongest possible way the concerns of the people who, in many ways, she represents by serving on the committee regarding Stansted. When she mentioned the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is chairman of the local authority that is responsible for the beautiful villages in that part of the world, I was not sure whether that was cause and effect. Many of us have known about Uttlesford and such places well in advance of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, adopting his benign control of Essex, in so far as it proves to be benign.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I assure my noble friend that we recognise that a great deal of the debate revolves round Stansted, though not solely. She is well aware of the pressure in other airports. The issue has a particular salience when it is in a part of the world that is green and pleasant. We recognise that we have to convince the neighbourhood of Stansted that its interests will be protected by the way in which we develop the airport facility. We ought not to be too pessimistic. You can increase aircraft movements and reduce noise if there are effective and strong incentives for the industry to produce quieter airports. That has been going on. Aircraft are becoming quieter. Of course, we need to put greater emphasis on that, which is exactly what the Bill does. It emphasises the fact that pressure will be placed on those who pollute the atmosphere, either by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_169"></a>

emissions or by noise, and they will pay. Therefore, there is an incentive for them to use aircraft that meet high specifications.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I am grateful for the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Smith on the opportunities that the Bill gives to airports for which he has considerable responsibility. We always felt that there was unfair discrimination. In recent years, Manchester airport has triumphed over such unfair discrimination and we hope to see that continue with the development of the activities of East Midlands airport.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>My noble friend Lord Soley never gives support without exacting a price, which is that I should consider carbon neutrality on the ground for airports. That is a most interesting suggestion and a mighty challenging one, as he knows. In some parts of the world it is easier to do that from a new beginning rather than from where we are now. He will recognise just how great a demand that is. In the spirit of friendship, I undertake to consider that. We need to explore that fruitful matter and if we have particular economic activities that present real challenges, no doubt the question should be addressed to them most forcefully. I believe that was the burden of his comments.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>My note says that I hope I have adequately met the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. I am sure I have not, and she will make that clear in Committee. She will recognise on health issues and on trading emissions that we are making progress; the Bill represents that. On that basis, I hope that she will feel that I have not neglected her contribution to the debate.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="51101-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Transport (Wales) Bill is to provide powers to enable the National Assembly for Wales to deliver a first-class integrated transport system for Wales. Along with existing powers and those that the Assembly is acquiring under the Railways Act, the Transport (Wales) Bill will provide the Assembly with a comprehensive and coherent set of transport powers for the first time. At present the Assembly has to rely on a patchwork of legislative provisions relating to transport that date back to the Ministry of Transport Act 1919. The Bill will ensure that the Assembly has the powers it needs to deliver a properly integrated transport system for the whole of Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I shall explain briefly how the Bill has been carefully developed over a number of years. As far back as 1997, the Welsh Transport Advisory Group, chaired by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales&#151;who was then Transport Minister in the Welsh Office&#151;started examining the transport legacy which the Assembly would inherit. That work was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

further developed in the policy review of public transport conducted by the Assembly&#039;s former Environment, Planning and Transport Committee in 2001.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>When the Assembly Government responded to the review in July the following year, it indicated that it would seek transport planning and implementation powers along the lines of those available to the Mayor of London under the Greater London Authority Act 1999; a power to enable the Assembly to establish a joint transport authority and to allow for that possibility in any part of Wales; and to seek power to direct the Strategic Rail Authority. There was a wide degree of cross-party support for those proposals in the Assembly itself.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that this Bill was originally published as a draft on 27 May 2004. It was then subject to scrutiny jointly by the Welsh Affairs Committee of the other place and the Assembly&#039;s Economic Development and Transport Committee. That represented a small but significant piece of constitutional history, as it was the first time that a Select Committee from the other place had formally met with a committee of a devolved administration. Those meetings demonstrated an innovative and progressive approach to pre-legislative scrutiny and, again, they demonstrated a high level of cross-party support for the measures in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>There was also a major public consultation involving all key interested parties. In total, 14 recommendations made as part of the public consultation were accepted and changes were made to the draft Bill; 11 of those recommendations mirrored those within the Welsh Affairs and the Economic Development and Transport Committees&#039; reports on the Bill. For example, it was recommended that a clause should be included in the Bill to provide the Assembly with the power necessary to establish a public transport users&#039; committee for Wales. That recommendation was accepted and the power is now covered in Clauses 8 to 10 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I should make it absolutely clear at this stage that the rail provisions, which were included in the draft Bill, have now been removed. Equivalent powers now form part of the Railways Act 2005. That means that while rail services will form a central part of the Wales Transport Strategy, most of the relevant rail provisions are now contained in that Act.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I have hosted two meetings in the House of Lords attended by the relevant Ministers&#151;one in July 2004 and the other on 19th of last month&#151;to provide further information on the Bill to Members of this House who wished to attend. We are not planning to table any government amendments, as the sheer amount of pre-legislative scrutiny has refined the Bill in such a way that we are all very happy with it. However, I should be grateful to noble Lords if they could let us know whether there are any ways in which the Bill could be further improved and I undertake to give the most careful consideration to any such suggestions.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_171"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51101-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I turn briefly to the provisions of the Bill. The Transport (Wales) Bill will make the development of transport in Wales a core task of the Assembly. First, the Bill will place a new statutory duty on the Assembly to develop and implement policies for the promotion of safe, integrated, sustainable, efficient and economic transport facilities and services. The Assembly would also be required to prepare and publish a Wales Transport Strategy setting out the Assembly&#039;s vision for a transport system which strikes a balance between our economic, social and environmental objectives, as well as focusing on how that vision is to be delivered. The Assembly intends to consult widely with all interested parties in drawing up the strategy.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The Bill contains a statutory requirement on the Assembly to consult Welsh local authorities and those in England that border Wales. English authorities will be involved in the development of the Wales Transport Strategy and the Welsh Assembly Government will work to enhance transport services and infrastructure&#151;so the strategy will work for people on both sides of the border.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Secondly, while local authorities are already required to prepare local transport plans, the Bill will now provide a formal mechanism to ensure that their transport plans are consistent with the Assembly&#039;s overall vision for transport in Wales. In other words, local authorities will be required to produce new local transport plans in line with the Wales Transport Strategy. In order to ensure that local transport plans are consistent with the Wales Transport Strategy, they will need to be submitted to the Assembly for approval. Refusing approval will be possible only with the approval of the Assembly in plenary session. The Assembly and local authorities will work closely on these plans and I anticipate that any refusal to approve a plan would be wholly exceptional.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Another important element of the Bill is the provision to facilitate greater joint working by local authorities to produce transport plans, which is essential to make real improvements in key transport corridors. The particular geography of Wales means that transport issues often cross local authority boundaries, and consequently need to be tackled on a regional basis. The most telling example of this is, of course, south east Wales, which covers 10 local authority areas and around half the population of Wales. Here, there is an existing pattern of travel-to-work movements from the valleys into Cardiff and Newport, which is superimposed on more strategic east-west movement along the M4 corridor and, to a lesser extent, the A465 heads of the valleys road. A regional approach is the only realistic way to tackle transport planning in these circumstances. It would address both public transport and road traffic management, as well as dealing effectively with the strategic trunk road network.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The Bill also contains a power to establish a joint transport authority, which would consist of two or more local authorities working together jointly to tackle transport issues in a given region. Powers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_172"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

granted to a joint authority might, for example, include the co-ordination of bus timetables, a standardised approach towards bus lanes and bus stops and improved services across local authority boundaries. This is an enabling provision, and the Assembly Government have made it clear that they would invoke that power only if they felt that the current voluntary arrangements were not making sufficient progress in delivering integrated transport solutions in any part of Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The next main provision of the Bill will enable the Assembly to provide funding for transport services direct to transport operators, in order to ensure that unfulfilled transport needs in Wales are met. The new power might be used to support services which cross a number of local authority boundaries; for example, to implement the Assembly&#039;s long-distance bus and coach strategy. The Bill will also give the Assembly the power to provide revenue payments to airline operators or capital funding to provide new airport facilities, subject, of course, to the constraints of EC competition law. This will allow the Assembly to implement its policies on intra-Wales scheduled air services, for example.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Additionally, the Bill would enable the Assembly to establish a public transport users&#039; committee for Wales. As I said earlier, this is a new provision added in response to views expressed during pre-legislative scrutiny. The committee will cover all public transport modes&#151;that is, ferries, air services and taxis, as well as buses and trains&#151;ensuring that the voice of the passenger is heard. I should point out that funding for all aspects of the Transport (Wales) Bill&#151;for example, the establishment of the public transport users&#039; committee&#151;will be met by the Assembly and there will be no new money from Westminster.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I greatly look forward to listening to noble Lords&#039; views on the Bill. If it is enacted, the Assembly will have a new statutory duty to develop and implement policies for the promotion of safe, integrated, sustainable, efficient and economic transport facilities and services. It is an aspiration that we can all share. If noble Lords have questions about any aspects of the Bill, the policy that underlies it or the detail of how we envisage the arrangements working, I would be more than happy to discuss these with them, or to provide a written reply as the groundwork for further discussion in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51101-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>This is an important Bill which has received widespread support from interested parties in Wales and other places. I hope that in this House we can achieve a similar degree of consensus on the principles of what is a significant Bill for developing an integrated transport system in Wales. I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="51101-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, this is a comparatively simple and straightforward Bill, as indeed it should it be after its prolonged pre-legislative <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_173"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scrutiny towards the end of the last Parliament and all the consideration its main elements received prior to that. As the Minister reminded us, the Assembly published its <i>Transport Framework for Wales</i> as far back as November 2001. Since then, there have been a number of separate studies devoted to rural transport, the provision of rail services and the future of air transport in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>When one considers the volume of preparatory work and literature, it is almost surprising that all we have at the end of the day is a 17-clause Bill laying a duty on the Assembly to develop and implement transport policies and prepare a strategy for implementation through local authorities and other subsidiary bodies. Indeed, the Government themselves admit in the Bill summary that it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;is not intended to break new ground, but rather to ensure that the Assembly has comprehensive powers in the transport field enabling it to provide an integrated transport system for Wales&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I do not wish to be cynical, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there has been a great deal of talk and very little delivery on better services so far and that the Assembly Government are not much nearer now to effecting significant transport improvements in Wales than they were when all this began five and more years ago.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I had responsibility for transport in Wales in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1994, we announced a proposal for a southerly bypass of Newport off the M4. I am astonished that so little progress has been made with that proposal over the past 10 years. I gather that progress with the upgrading of the A465&#151;the heads of the valleys road&#151;also leaves much to be desired.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>While I am on the subject of roads, which does not feature prominently in the Bill, I hope the Assembly remembers that it was the extensive road-building programme pursued in Wales by the Conservative government that brought new factories and prosperity to Wales along the M4 in the south and the A55 in the north. Good road communications and their maintenance are absolutely essential to a thriving economy, which is the main financial prop of our public services and so much else.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The mainspring of the Bill, and all the discussion that has preceded it, is the need for an integrated transport policy and the system that goes with it. Such a policy has been a popular battle cry with transport boffins for as long as I can remember. The trouble is that the ideas which stem from such a policy are often fanciful and do not match the needs and priorities perceived by the public or, indeed, dictated by the realities on the ground. People will not readily abandon their cars for trains or buses simply because transport planners think they should. I sound a cautionary note simply because it is so easy to get the strategy wrong if it is dictated by theoretical rather than practical needs and considerations.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>In spite of the availability of subsidy, there must be a realistic demand for a service, otherwise public money runs to waste. We are all familiar with the sight of empty buses, trains and aircraft too, fuelled at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_174"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taxpayers&#039; expense. I hope that the public transport users&#039; committee, to be established under Clause 9, will help to ensure that realism, rather than wishful thinking, prevails in the Assembly&#039;s strategic planning.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>As the Minister reminded us, there was a substantial amount about rail services in the original Bill. However, the clauses establishing rail passenger committees and the power of the Assembly to give directions to the Strategic Rail Authority have all disappeared. We are left wondering just how Network Rail and the various rail services are going to contribute to the integrated transport strategy and its implementation. That rail is an all-important ingredient in such a strategy goes without saying. The paucity of references to rail in the Bill worries many, including the Very Reverend Archimandrite Father Deiniol, who has made representations to a number of your Lordships on behalf of his group &quot;Un Ein Blaenau&quot;, which means &quot;moving ahead&quot;. The title has a special poignancy because the organisation is based at Blaenau Ffestiniog.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>There is renewed interest in providing an internal air service in Wales linking north and south. The Assembly will have power under Clause 11 of the Bill to establish and financially support such a service. There have been numerous attempts to do this in the past and all have failed for lack of customers and patronage. In my ministerial days, there was a daily service between Cardiff airport and Hawarden, subsidised by Clwyd County Council. I often found myself the only passenger on the flight. The latest proposal involves Swansea, Cardiff and RAF Valley, Anglesey, and the venture is being supported by the Assembly. Of course I wish it every success.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>There is probably more human traffic between north and south these days than in the past, especially by officials of the Assembly and local government. But the incentive to make that 200 mile each-way journey to and from Cardiff by air in a day, rather than the two-day trek by road, with mileage and overnight allowances, has to be significant in terms of time, cost and convenience to attract sufficient private as well as public sector customers to sustain the service.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>A major proposal in the Bill is that the Assembly has power to require two or more local authorities to enter into arrangements for the joint discharge of their transport functions. This makes good sense and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;it is a power that should have been available since the time of local government reorganisation in 1993.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>There is also the power to form joint transport authorities to discharge specific functions. Some local authorities have already wisely combined to tackle their transport problems jointly, but the new JTAs will be separate corporate bodies, created by the Assembly, although largely composed of local authority members. The Welsh Local Government Association doubts the value of the proposed new authorities which may overlap the existing consortia in terms of area and function. There is a legitimate argument here which we must consider carefully in Committee, together with cross-border issues.

</p>

<a name="51101-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Despite the longevity of the Bill&#039;s gestation, there is now a feeling of urgency about the need for it and the power it confers. There is certainly a sense of urgency on the ground in Wales. The Institution of Civil Engineers recently produced an assessment of the transport infrastructure in Wales and gave a C grade&#151;that is, average category&#151;to all forms of transport, except airports and seaports which fared rather better with a B grade.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>We must ensure that our transport infrastructure is of the highest quality and is capable of meeting the needs of a versatile economy and of a society which is very dependent on its mobility. If the Bill can help in that direction, we shall be happy to support it.

<a name="51101-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, as is obvious, I am not Welsh, but I have worked in several places bordering on Wales and Cardiff. I hate to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, but the revolution in railway services which he mentioned is about to start in Wales in December. There will then be a much more regular service&#151;one of two hours&#151;between Holyhead and Cardiff. There will be regular-interval services over a great many of the lines in Wales. Much attention is being given to providing good connections at Chester, Shrewsbury, Hereford, Newport and Swansea with mainline services. Better rolling stock will be employed in the services. There will be a 28 per cent increase in daily services and they will rise from 800 to 1,000. That is not at the expense of the taxpayer; it is all within the existing franchise.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Therefore, let us realise that without the intervention of the Assembly and the powers sought in the Bill, great improvements are already taking place. It has taken the rail industry nearly seven years to recover from the havoc to which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, was party in dragging our railway system apart. Arriva Trains Wales is following South West Trains and other train operators in at last putting together railway timetables.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>There is, however, an important point for the Government to note. The incentive systems included in franchise agreements work against providing connections. So much is put on the trains being punctual that the question of whether the passengers make a through journey is entirely lost. When a transport system depends on connections for its efficiency, the efficiency of the transport system will decline.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>While something of a revolution is at hand&#151;Arriva Trains Wales has produced a standard-pattern timetable, including through trains&#151;there remains a lot to do about the train services. We need only go to the valleys to see rolling stock which is, together with that of Northern Rail, totally unacceptable in the south-east of England, or anywhere where people regularly come to this place and complain. Yet the franchise, which has 13.5 years to run, does not provide for the replacement of the rolling stock. The Assembly might have been given powers at least to ask <br>&nbsp;<br>

the franchisee what would be involved in obtaining some suitable rolling stock to work on the valley services.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Last year, the valley services gained 10 per cent in patronage with the most rotten rolling stock. If that rolling stock were replaced, the service would be revolutionised with more passengers. Some of the people who the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, says must use their cars might be attracted to the train services provided. I ask the Minister to consider whether the Assembly&#039;s powers enable it to alter the Wales franchise without going on bended knee to the Department for Transport in London to deal with something which is essentially a Welsh matter. Although the trains serve the stations between Chester and Shrewsbury and Hereford, which are in England, as they must, they are basically Welsh services and they ought to be dealt with by the Assembly.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>There is another threat on which I hope the Minister will be able to comment or, if not, write to us about. The whole of the service has been predicated on the timetables which apply along the north and south Wales coast.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Yet 18 months ago First Great Western introduced a half-hourly service between Cardiff and London and the franchise is about to be relet. Letters have been sent out by the Strategic Rail Authority in its dying days threatening to reduce the service from Cardiff to London from half-hourly to hourly.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a> Those of us who travel on these trains know that many of the existing trains are full and cutting the service in half will increase dissatisfaction and increase the load on the M4. It seems nonsensical and it will probably save little rolling stock. The Minister should give urgent attention to the matter because the whole of the new timetable is predicated on those services being available.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a> In many other ways the Bill is strong on setting up new bureaucracy. It sets up procedures whereby the Assembly will look at local transport plans. It provides the setting up of a regional transport authority and the arrangements for a new transport users&#039; committee. Those all cost a great deal of money but they do not improve the transport system that people have available to them. The Welsh were extremely clever when they introduced the new old people&#039;s bus pass in Wales, because unlike in England it applies over the whole of Wales. Although the local authorities in Wales issue the bus passes and they have their badge on them, they are available over the whole of Wales, so the same system applies everywhere and one can go anywhere in Wales on it. That is an extremely good thing.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a> The other good thing about the Welsh system is that it agreed that for each passenger carried there would be a single system of reimbursing the operators. That is a great difference from the system that applies in England, where every local authority negotiates with the operator so over the whole country there is a patchwork of agreements. People are usually confined to the district council that issues their bus pass, so they can go a little way but not very far.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

</p>

<a name="51101-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a> In providing a decent bus service, one of the most important things&#151;which was referred to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy&#151;is that bus services need to be co-ordinated. There are two ways of co-ordinating them; we can have the Assembly saying that a bus will be run from here to there and someone else will run it from there to the next place; or we can encourage the bus operators to co-ordinate the services themselves. Unfortunately, the Competition Act 1998 made it extremely difficult for bus operators to work together to provide just what passengers want: through services and through tickets; an integrated service with the through timetable, because all those things are disallowed under the competition law, which was aimed more at big industries, not small bus services. Bus operators are frightened even to go and talk to other bus operators about the co-ordination desired. A great deal could be done if in Wales it were possible for bus operators to co-ordinate their services together, because whatever powers we give to the Assembly to co-ordinate them, that piece of legislation would almost certainly need repealing.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a> The appointment of a traffic commissioner in Wales would have been advantageous in this Bill. At present in Wales one must go either to Birmingham or to Manchester to a traffic commissioner. There is no traffic commissioner in Wales, yet there is a great deal of need. I am sorry to say that in Wales we have probably some of the worst abuses that exist. On the A55 between Chester and Holyhead the North Wales Police have pulled in large numbers of lorries that are breaking all the rules, particularly those related to drivers&#039; hours, many of them working as long as two or three days without proper rest, yet there is no disciplinary body in Wales that can deal with those people.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a> Similarly, in south Wales there are some of the most irresponsible passenger operators in the country. I will not name them, but I am sure that they will be known to some noble Lords present. It would be useful if there was a traffic commissioner in Cardiff who had responsibility for Wales and got to know intimately the operators instead of depending on someone several hundreds of miles away who has plenty to do as things are.
</p>

<a name="51101-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a> The Bill is an opportunity lost. It does not acknowledge what has been done; it does not go so far as to make impossible other things that it might have done. My noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie will reflect on some of the things that are being done in Scotland that might have been done in Wales if further powers were available to the Assembly, because the Scottish example is one that I would have hoped Wales would follow.

<a name="51101-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   My Lords, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who have just spoken, I bring no expert knowledge or insight to the discussion this evening. I therefore hope that it is not presumptuous for me to add a word of warm welcome to the Bill and my appreciation of the hard work that has been put <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_178"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

into its preparation by the men and women of the Assembly and the team of civil servants in both Cardiff and London over the past five years. I understand that it is a Bill that has commanded almost universal acclaim in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I must hasten to add that like the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and other noble Lords, I too have received this evening the letter from the Very Reverend Archimandrite Father Deiniol from Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd. He argues powerfully that unless the Bill is extended to include certain aspects of rail transport it will give us something less than a properly integrated transport system in Wales. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Evans for having related the Bill&#039;s long history and the scrutiny of the draft Bill. However, I note that the Assembly&#039;s Economic Development and Transport Committee in its report dated July 2004 drew attention to what it described as the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;extremely short time available for this scrutiny of the draft Bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Those words can be found on page 10 of the report. I hope and trust that the UK Government will take account of that message.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The Bill represents an important contribution to economic and social development, but for many people it is also welcome for the opportunity it may offer to promote environmental sustainability, which everybody agrees is essential. How likely is that to come about? I shall dwell on that question for a minute or two.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The term &quot;sustainability&quot; is embedded among four other adjectives in Clause 1(1)(a) yet we know that there is an existing overriding duty on the Assembly to make a sustainable development scheme that will apply to all its functions and relate to all its fields. That duty is to be found in Section 121 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. I have always thought that that provision has considerable potential, although nowhere in the 1998 Act or in the Bill have I seen a definition of the meaning of the word &quot;sustainable&quot;. Given the existing duty in Section 121, and notwithstanding what is said on this matter in the report on the draft Bill published in July 2004, I am somewhat puzzled as to the significance of the appearance of the word &quot;sustainable&quot; in Clause 1(1)(a). Can my noble friend confirm whether it adds anything to, or is different from, the duty in Section 121? It seems to me that the position remains the same and is untouched.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>According to what I have heard, there is some concern in some quarters that the sustainable development scheme has not worked as well as was hoped in 1998. Is there any sound basis for such concern? Can the Minister tell the House how much progress has been made by the Assembly in achieving sustainable development? I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to deal with that question tonight and may prefer to respond to it in writing.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Turning to the future, is the Minister able to indicate whether the Wales transport strategy, to which he referred, will set out the environmental quality to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_179"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

achieved over the next 10 or 15 years? What will the target be? How radical will the vision be? I use the word &quot;vision&quot; because the Economic Development and Transport Committee refers to its vision for public transport in Wales. The Bill goes on to arm the Assembly with a mechanism for implementing the transport strategy. Is the Minister in a position to give some clearer idea to the House of whether it will require funding in addition to the &#163;8 billion to be made available over the next 15 years that was announced a year ago by Andrew Davies, the Assembly&#039;s Minister for Economic Affairs? Has that money been ringfenced? Indeed, does the Assembly know today&#151;is it possible for any government to know&#151;how much money will be required to implement a transport policy effectively over the next 10 or 15 years in a fast changing world? From what is known, will &#163;8 billion be enough? It usually never is. Will any additional funding that may well be necessary be made available by the Assembly?
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>I have only one more question for the Minister. We are well aware that there are huge tasks ahead for the National Assembly for Wales during the next few years. For my part, I would not underrate the difficulties that may lie ahead. It is that that induces me to ask whether the Assembly has the essential human resources in order to cope with the immediate implementation of the Bill and of the Government of Wales Bill, on which Ministers and officials in London and Cardiff are working very hard.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>That is my last question, but finally I offer one comment on the historical significance of the Bill. We have never before had a Transport (Wales) Bill and in the long history of your Lordships&#039; House since it became a second Chamber, it has never before, as far as I can see, had two Wales-only Bills before it at the same time. I suggest that this is evidence that the old order changeth, and none too soon for Wales, thanks to the momentum of devolution and the Government of Wales Act 1998.

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="51101-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b>  My Lords, the Bill is devolutionary in trend and so I support it. It is quite obvious that I do not come from Wales. However, one of my great-grandfathers was Lord Penrhyn, who, unfortunately, was one-half of the three-year strike by quarrymen around about 1900, about which I shall cease being boastful.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>When I looked at Clauses 1(1) and 2(1), (2) and (3) and I saw the word &quot;must&quot;, I wrote down beside them, &quot;Does this really constitute devolution?&quot;. I do not believe that devolved power and &quot;must do something&quot; go together. I went on to write down, &quot;Of course they should have a strategy, but should choose to do so themselves&quot;. The terminology of the Bill is heavy-handed and does nothing to rebalance the lopsided federalism to which it purports to contribute.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>That said, I praise the Bill for devolving control of the passenger railway service. However, I wonder why it does so only by implication. Why can we not have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_180"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the devolution of control of the Welsh rail franchise on the face of the Bill? I did not see it there anyway; perhaps it is there.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>My main concern about this exercise in devolution is about how limited it is when compared with the devolution of transport in Scotland&#151;where I do come from. The recent transfer of financial control of Network Rail in Scotland and of the ScotRail passenger franchise has given the Scottish Parliament most welcome powers to press ahead with developing the rail network and expanding it. And now I shall start being boastful again&#151;but not, noble Lords will be pleased to hear, about my achievements or those of my family.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>On 26 September 2005, the Queen Street to Maryhill service was extended to Anniesland. The reopening of the railway to Larkhall on 11 December this year symbolises the renaissance in railway use in Scotland, as does the work being undertaken right in front of my home on the Stirling, Alloa and Kincardine Railway which will benefit passengers, freight, coal and the Forth rail bridge, as well as Edinburgh commuters who will be able to have more paths across the rail bridge because the coal is now coming through Alloa.


</p>

<a name="51101-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The Scottish Parliament has before it Bills and plans for a railway in the Borders from Galashiels to Edinburgh, long overdue rail links with Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports and two tram lines in Edingburgh. Consideration has been given to reopening the Bathgate to Drumgelloch railway, thereby recreating a fifth rail route between Edingburgh and Glasgow. Moreover, a sixth route is being considered for bullet train use in the future. Historians of Scottish railways will note that there were six rail routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow, but I know of no proposal to reopen the first one, the Slamannan Railway.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Meanwhile, on the roads, the Scottish Executive&#039;s consultation is expected to conclude in the very near future on Scotland-wide free bus travel for older and disabled persons. I accept that going on like this is irrelevant to this Bill.

<a name="51101-16_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b>  My Lords, I have had at least some response. However, I think that it is worth spending a minute or so on these matters as they demonstrate that a more substantial devolution of powers can be more creative. Devolution also takes away the undoubted, and not necessarily unreasonable, focus of the United Kingdom Government and their transport department on the overpopulated south-east of England&#151;perhaps to the chagrin of the other English regions.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The British Labour Party&#039;s unionism has created a generously financed Scotland, and presumably that is so in Wales. I like the tactical situation but doubt the strategic context; of course, for me, dominion status rather than devolved status is the goal. This Bill will bring more control of transport to Wales but could be improved on.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="51101-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Jones: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Evans gave, as usual, a cogent and persuasive introduction to a Bill in his care. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, gave, as only he can as a long-serving former Minister on Welsh affairs, an experienced, informed and, at times, slightly rumbustious view of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has unmatchable insight into rail travel&#151;after all, he has done it and he gave a positive report. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, made a tangential and modest remark about the great north Wales slate strike. It remains, I have to say, a scarring sliver of our social history and still stirs the blood on its memory. The quarry museum and the great Penrhyn Castle remain as reminders of that history. It might be interesting to have a conversation rather than a debate with the noble Lord about that historic moment that so greatly scarred our people.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I welcome the Bill, which greatly enhances the Wales Assembly Government&#039;s capabilities of developing an economic transport system. Geography challenges the desire to unify the land of our fathers. The grain of the land makes it harder to travel from the north to the south of Wales and, indeed, easier to travel east to Liverpool, to Birmingham and to Bristol, or so it used to be for generations after Wales became an industrial nation. But now there are very positive factors; for instance, the building of the M4 motorway and the two mighty bridges across the River Severn estuary, plus the inauguration of the 125 high-speed train of some years ago, and the expansion of Cardiff Airport. These modern transport infrastructure initiatives have transformed south-east Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>That region&#039;s economy is now one of the most dynamic in western Europe. Improved communications have made a massive difference to this part of Wales. Of course they remain imperfect, but inward investment has materialised on the back of improving strategic communications. I think that the old Welsh Office and the Welsh Assembly can be proud of their foresight and of their investment.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I recollect, as a Minister with transport responsibilities in the administrations of the late Lords Wilson and Callaghan, that the Welsh Office officials, with whom I worked, were of the highest calibre. They laid good foundations. I personally owe them a great deal. I believe that the current assembly team is of the same quality. They certainly care.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The Wales Assembly Government have earned and deserve the additional powers presaged in the Bill. We can only welcome Clause 2 and its dwelling upon the requirement of a strategy. That strategy I believe will be successful because the clause emphasises consultation with the local authorities of Wales. That must be the way forward.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>As the Minister said, Clause 8 itemises a Public Transport Users&#039; Committee for Wales. As Wales is a small nation, I think that we can make this committee a success and the transport providers truly responsive to the long-suffering and frequently ignored passengers. Can we, with special measures, seek to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_182"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

protect and reassure female passengers as this legislation becomes functioning reality? Surely there are initiatives that we might take.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I suggest, as and when it is possible, that the Welsh Assembly should consider electrifying the Wrexham-Birkenhead railway. The axis of that railway line travels through a densely populated and increasingly prosperous community in north-east Wales. There would be a certain economic return from that investment. It is not, however, a cheap scheme. Secondly, I think that the Assembly should urgently take passenger rail services into Deeside Industrial Park in north-east Wales. With over 6,000 employees, the Deeside Industrial Park is one of the foremost industrial locations in western Europe. It should have rail services.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Thirdly, the Assembly should set up quite speedily air services from Cardiff to locations in north Wales. Our seat of government, Cardiff, is truly far away from Llangefni in Anglesey, from Caernarfon in Gwynedd and from Hawarden in Flintshire. I think that an urgent, imaginative approach could shrink Wales and unite it as well. Her Majesty&#039;s Government use the phrase &quot;Intra Wales Scheduled Air Services&quot;. Whatever they may be described as, can we please have them urgently, at least to see whether they are viable?
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Fourthly, I hope that the Assembly will guarantee the future of the Central Wales line and lobby constantly for the continued retention of the Shrewsbury-Newport railway line. Perhaps the Assembly should institute studies designed to make the north/south road link a faster and better road. I need to declare at this stage that I am president of the Wrexham-Birkenhead Rail Users Association&#151;a most honourable and long-standing voluntary group of dedicated enthusiasts and often employees of the industry.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>To conclude, the Welsh Assembly is not yet two terms old but it has come a long way quickly. It has earned the vote of confidence that this Bill represents. With this legislation in its hands, the Assembly Members and its industrious Cabinet Ministers surely can have greater confidence in their capacity to get things done in the sphere of transport.

I welcome it as a useful, practical step forward in the search for an integrated transport system in Wales but, like my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies, I also welcome it for another reason; that is, its historic nature. As he pointed out, not only is it the first Bill of its kind but there is another first attached to it: this is the first time that the Assembly and the Select Committee for Welsh Affairs in the other place have jointly formally taken evidence and reported&#151;albeit separately, as I think they should do. That unique process is important. I believe that the development of a joint legislative partnership of the kind that we are beginning to see is important for the future of Welsh political and social life.

</p>

<a name="51101-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>While I served on the Richard commission I became convinced that one of the most distinctive features of the Welsh devolution settlement could and should be a distinctive legislative partnership between the Assembly and Westminster. We see that some of those views are reflected in Chapter 13 of the Richard commission report; they are also reflected in the White Paper <i>Better Governance for Wales</i> that we have not yet had a chance to debate but which is before us. The Bill is also a product of that growing legislative partnership between Assembly and Westminster. As my noble friend pointed out, complementary joint scrutinising skills of the Assembly and of the Commons and its Select Committees come together in a useful and important way and are reflected in the way this Bill has been shaped.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>As my noble friend pointed out&#151;I wonder whether the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, has properly realised this&#151;the original Bill that went through the scrutiny process did have clauses relating to the railways. They were not cast aside&#151;they were in fact shorn from this Bill and have become the appropriate sections of the Railways Act 2005. Those powers that are now in the Railways Act 2005 transfer significant powers and responsibilities to the Welsh Assembly. For example, under the Railways Act provisions the Assembly will have the power to offer financial support and assistance to the franchisees; it will be involved in the whole franchising process and it will have the power to offer financial assistance to railway developments.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>In that context&#151;and perhaps in answer to the point that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, raised&#151;I wonder if my noble friend could confirm that the powers in the Railways Act 2005, which devolved powers to the Welsh Assembly, are equivalent to those of the Scottish Executive? Will my noble friend compare them and tell us whether the powers that the Welsh Assembly has are now on a par with those that the Scottish Executive has in relation to franchising and the capacity to finance and support railway developments? I would be grateful if he could confirm that, just in case there is a misapprehension that there has not been a significant transfer of responsibilities relating to the railways; although they are not in this Bill, they were in the Railways Act 2005.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>The vital challenge for the Welsh Assembly is to marry the powers it is going to obtain in this Bill with the powers that it has already obtained from the Railways Act 2005. With those powers and in relation to an integrated transport system, the powers related to the railways will be vital. I therefore hope that my noble friend will confirm that the Assembly has such powers.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>In that context, I hope that my noble friend will answer a second question. My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies already raised the question of funding and financing. This Bill does not generate a huge amount of costs except in relation to setting up transport authorities and so forth. So extra money will come to the Assembly not under this Bill but under the Railways Act. In that context I wonder if there will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_184"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be&#151;and there should be&#151;a comparable transfer of funding and support from what is a central government department to the Assembly. I understand these negotiations and discussions have been taking place but I think it would be useful if my noble friend could give us the rounded picture of the situation concerning the devolving of transport policy. How far have these negotiations reached?
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The transfer of the subsidy money and the rest of it that should come to the Assembly attached to the powers that it is going to receive under the Railways Act: could the Minister give us a rough and ready? We will not pin him down to the last pound and pence, but could he give us some idea of the estimated amount of money that is likely to take place with the powers that have been transferred under the Railways Act? These will be vital. As my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies said&#151;rightly in my view&#151;this Bill has to be funded from within the existing annual budget. But the extra powers that are now going to be given to the Assembly under the Act should have with them the appropriate transfer of funds and support. I would be grateful if my noble friend could tell us a little bit more about that.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, was a little curmudgeonly, if I may say. I pay tribute to him for the work he has done. It was under his period in office that the wonderful A470 was built which means that at last one can get to Cardiff from Merthyr somewhat easier than the missionary going from Dowlais who, when she reached Quakers Yard said, &quot;Well that&#039;s the worst part of the journey over&quot;. He and I opened the road together and his name is on the plaque in the middle of the road, so I accept the contribution that he made to the road building. But he did not make the contribution to the A465: the dualling is now taking place and his remarks on the development of the A465 post-dates him and there is now a very important dualling section open on the road.
</p>

<a name="51101-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, certainly struck a chord with me in his observation of the difficult balance that has to be struck between timetable targets and connections. As someone who is every week biting his nails wondering whether I am going to catch the connection from Swansea West or vice versa on the Great Western line, the fear that, because Arriva and Great Western want to maintain a very strict timetable, I will watch the train which is supposed to be the connection leave as we are pulling in is a real one. That important balance must be struck. But having said that, I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and others that the railways are packed. I agree with his observations about the state of the valley stock and indeed Arriva is not great either. One climbs on these trains with luggage and everything as many people are going west. I do believe that there is a need for action on stock.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51101-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, like my noble friend Lord Rowlands, I am a traveller; I can claim no other interest in the railways. I am delighted to follow my noble friends Lord Jones and Lord Rowlands, with both of whom I have served on many Welsh Grand Committees. This is rather like an old boys&#039; reunion, together with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who now speaks from a different side of the House.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>I begin with two preliminary observations and then seek to give some cautionary notes about how the Assembly may respond to the welcome powers that the Bill passes to it. I will not labour my first point, as the Minister and my noble friend Lord Rowlands made it well. The Bill is a model of co-operation between Westminster and the Assembly. My noble friend Lord Rowlands was a distinguished member of the Richard Commission. There seemed to be a great divide between the Assembly and Parliament, and a need to bridge that gap. It can be shown that that is possible by seeking pragmatically to work together. The history of the Bill has been outlined: its publication over a year ago, pre-legislative scrutiny to ensure that the terms are not set in tablets of stone, and then the relevant committees of the Assembly and this House working together. It was a model of co-operation. There has been so much scrutiny of the Bill that cynics might say that there is nothing left for us to do or say, but that has never stopped any Member of this or indeed any other House adding further. The Bill is a model of partnership of which we totally approve.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Secondly, this transfer of powers to the Assembly is very proper, because transport is so vital to its other responsibilities that it is wholly appropriate that it should take the lead in that field. Currently the Assembly has very limited powers but there are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_186"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

massive problems. It is now charged with the duty of both developing and implementing policy. I join my noble friend Lord Rowlands in asking the Minister to set out the differences between the powers now available to the Assembly under the Railways Act and those available to the Scottish Parliament. Obviously, we cannot reasonably ask for that now but it would be helpful in terms of grants for the transfer of freight to rail, investments in rolling stock and infrastructure, and so on.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I think that everyone would agree that under governments of all stripes there has been massive underinvestment in the railways. Some 10 years ago, the <i>Western Mail</i> compared the Paddington to Swansea line with the line from Paris to Angers, both of which are about 200 miles long. The conclusions were alarming. All the indices favoured France, not only in terms of speed but in pricing, punctuality and so on. That differential is almost certainly still there. In some ways, the journey times have worsened over recent years because of the need to reach targets. We welcome the fact that, now that the Wales and Border franchise has been awarded, all regional and local services are provided by a single operator.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The Assembly may face new temptations under the new scheme of things. I wholly accept that the Secretary of State&#039;s powers should be transferred to the Assembly. But let us not close our eyes to the fact that in Wales, be it <i>hiraeth</i> or our wonderful valley spirit, there is a certain parochialism, which does not provide a basis for strategic planning. Those dangers may be seen, for example, in how we made our local government changes: the counties were far more extensive geographically, so they were far better for planning, particularly in transport. Now that we have the possibility of joint authority under the Bill, the Assembly will have to guard against excessive parochialism.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Although Wales is a political expression, and a historical and cultural entity, it is not a geographical area. There may also be a temptation, when drawing up a Wales strategy, not to look at the border areas and how important developments on the other side of the border have an impact on Wales&#039;s own transport infrastructure. Many years ago, before the M4 was completed, I argued that the completion of various stretches of that motorway in England, as we got lost in the highways and byways of Wiltshire, was far more important for development in Wales than any development in Wales. Perhaps that is a lesson to look more widely, including at the border areas, when devising an all-Wales transport strategy. In the past, there has been a failure to recognise that key developments at the other side of the border are very important.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The Assembly&#039;s increased responsibility may accentuate the difficulties of looking at the big picture. Quite understandably, many Members of the Assembly see their role as winning the bacon for their own area: if there is a cake to be divided, everyone must have their own share, even if it is a fairly small slice. Yet in Welsh strategic terms, a bigger picture for large-scale investments may be needed. I fear, for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_187"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

example, that the Hafod bypass in Swansea may not have had sufficient priority because it would take too large a slice of the cake and too little would be left for others. That temptation must be guarded against. Of course that temptation exists now for Parliament and the Secretary of State but he can stand aside in a way that would be a little more difficult for the Assembly to do.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I hear what is said about the intra-Wales regional airport strategy. I have had some experience of the, alas, abortive air link between Swansea, Cardiff and London. There are lessons to be learnt. Is there a danger, when there is a link between north and south Wales, that one will cater only for the elites, travelling from north to south? One should look very carefully at the subsidies for those air links.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Notwithstanding the understandable temptations that I have set out, I join my noble friends in commending the Bill. I adopt the two questions that my noble friend Lord Rowlands posed to the Minster. The transfer of powers and responsibilities to the Assembly will require much understanding, co-operation and goodwill between it and the local authorities in Wales and their own transport strategies.
</p>

<a name="51101-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>A similar amount of understanding, co-operation and goodwill with English local authorities will be required, which should be done in a spirit of consultation and reasonableness. The way in which this Bill has proceeded so far and the way in which the Assembly has shown itself willing to co-operate, listen and modify augurs well for the points that I have made. Therefore, those temptations may be avoided by our colleagues in the Assembly.

<a name="51101-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I feel privileged to take part in this debate with so many of my fellow Welshmen. I am not procedurally allowed to call them my friends, but we all have one interest at heart; that is, transport to fit the need of the people of Wales. I welcome the Minister and the Bill that he presents. However, in 50 years&#039; time, my grandchildren, or perhaps my great-grandchildren, may look at this Bill and see that it was calling for an integrated public transport system in Wales. They will see that there was no mention of railways. Even though there may be another Bill, we have to realise that we cannot proceed with this Bill without recognising the need for railways. Almost all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate admit to that. It is a strange Bill. It is more properly a Wales bus Bill than a Wales transport Bill.

So we need not only to maintain the present railway network but to improve it. In my own part of Wales&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, will know about it&#151;there is a possible upgrade to the railway from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Llandudno Junction, so that it will carry not only passengers but also freight. We need that.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="51101-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   My Lords, I apologise for interrupting the noble Lord. But has he looked at the powers in the Railways Act 2005 relating to Wales? They devolve to Wales responsibility for the very powers which I think he is seeking. There is no point in duplicating them in another Bill if they are already in an Act of Parliament.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="51101-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, my point is that to call this an integrated transport strategy for the whole of Wales without mentioning railways is an anomaly. There is something missing in the Bill. I will not ask the Minister many questions today. However, there is no extra financial help, apart from what is already in the Welsh Assembly budget. There is not a penny more. Financial assistance for aircraft, airstrips and airports has been mentioned. Where will that money come from? Where will the money to set up a transport users committee for Wales come from? Where will the subsidies come from? As far as I can see, there is not an extra penny available to meet those requests.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>One of the great success stories of Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly Government in recent years was when we had the Liberal Democrat/Labour partnership government. We introduced free bus travel for pensioners, which has been a real boon for pensioners in Wales. It has enabled them to travel&#151;and I think that all noble Lords who have spoken today are eligible for that free bus pass.

But all noble Lords who are from Wales are eligible. Bus routes, which would otherwise have disappeared because there were not enough passengers or income, were safeguarded. I am so glad that England and&#151;as I hear from my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie&#151;Scotland are moving in that direction. What Wales does today, the rest of the United Kingdom follows suit tomorrow.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para1"></a>

<a name="column_189"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 189</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be considered by the Assembly? My noble friend Lord Bradshaw referred to the co-ordination of timetables and how that is forbidden. At the beginning, we had very unhealthy competition by various bus companies in order to be the first to pick up customers. The Government must think again on that. Co-ordination of timetables and routes is essential in order to have the best possible service to meet the needs of the people of our communities.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Some people may say, &quot;But we need choice&quot;. Choice is not a word that we can use in most of Wales. There may be one shop, one school and one doctor&#039;s practice, and the nearest one may be many miles away. Choice might exist in areas of greater population, but not in rural areas. Without choice&#151;except Hobson&#039;s choice&#151;we must ensure that we present people with the very best that can be provided. The only bus needs to meet the needs of local passengers. Co-ordination must make certain that connections are met. For example, a train may arrive at Llandudno Junction from Blaenau Ffestiniog at 10.03 am, but the London train has just gone. We must consider the whole issue. I am sure that the new set-up in Wales will be very helpful in providing the best overall transport strategy for Wales.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>As regards air transport, we have a small budget and everything has to be met from the present Assembly budget. We need to look at that very thoroughly. What is the best use of the money available? Is any commercial company ready to undertake this type of travel? More than a feasibility study is needed. Thoroughgoing research is necessary in order to investigate whether, if we had money and anyone could convince us, it would not be better spent on air transport or on improving our roads and railways. At the moment, I think that the jury is out on that. If there are proposals on that, we need to be thoroughly convinced that they are the right proposals.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>We look forward to the debates in Committee. We are all going in the same direction. Together, I am sure that we will try to ensure that the best fully-integrated transport service will serve adequately the people of Wales.

My noble friend Lord Jones referred to the quality of the officials here from the Assembly. I have to say that they have answered every question asked today. If I speak to the notes and answer the questions in the detail required, I will speak for a minimum of 45 minutes. I propose to touch on some of the most important points, but I will not ignore the very valuable and significant points that have been made. We will get back to everyone with an answer so that before the Committee stage noble Lords will have a complete picture.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para5"></a>

<a name="column_190"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noted that point in my opening speech and would like to note it again because it is of great importance and bodes well for the future.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>One of my noble friends described the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, as curmudgeonly. I thought that he was a little tough on the Bill, but we all noticed that, after he got a few things off his chest, he said that there was a sense of urgency and a need for this Bill in Wales. He said that one organisation had given transport in Wales a &#039;C&#039; grade. We acknowledge that the purpose of this Bill is to improve on that.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked whether the Assembly had made any significant transport improvements. He expressed that in such a way that he perhaps expected a minimalist answer. In fact, I have in front of me two foolscap pages of what has been done. It is precisely the sort of document that needs to be circulated to everyone rather than for me to stand at the Dispatch Box going through every achievement. What has been done is of considerable significance and I hope that when the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, sees this he will agree with me.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The noble Lord also talked about the lack of progress on road schemes. Again, we find that difficult to accept. The Assembly Government are committed to the delivery of a new M4 around Newport to relieve congestion on existing motorways. The preparatory work is in hand. Construction will start in 2010 with completion in 2012 subject, of course, to statutory procedures. On the A465 heads of the valley road, which was mentioned this evening, we are committed to a complete dualling between Abergavenny and Dowlais, near Merthyr Tydfil, within 10 years&#151;by 2014.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The noble Lord asked us for an assurance that there will be a realistic demand for a service before any subsidy is given. We have undertaken a major scoping study, including modelling work, to forecast passenger demand for a Cardiff to RAF Valley service.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Related to that, noble Lords asked for projections on numbers for an intra-Wales air service. Consultants have projected 13,000 passengers a year increasing to 18,000 by year four.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, brings his considerable expertise on transport to bear on this Bill and argues that incentive systems and franchises are counter effective. The Assembly is a cosignatory to the Wales and Border franchise and will be able to influence all contractual issues, including penalty incentive arrangements. We should note that the Assembly responsibilities commence when 13 years remain on the existing franchises that have a legal contractual basis. On the existing franchise, there may need to be some negotiation with the existing train operating companies. He also pointed out the need for better, more suitable rolling stock on the valleys service. The Assembly this year announced investment in additional rolling stock to alleviate valleys overcrowding, which provides for more than 2,000 extra peak seats or some 27 per cent additional peak capacity. That happens to be used rolling stock class 150 sprinter vehicles, which are very suitable for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

use on the valley network and represented better value than new rolling stock had any been available. The Assembly is in discussion with Arriva Trains Wales about its future rolling stock needs to meet increased demand which continues to rise.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, also asked whether the Assembly has powers to enable it to amend franchises for the Wales and Border region without going to England. The Assembly will become a joint signatory to the Arriva Trains Wales franchise with the Department for Transport. The Assembly will be the funding authority for the franchise and will be able to specify service patterns. Finally, the noble Lord asked about the possible non-exclusion of half hourly off-peak Cardiff to London rail services. As part of the bidding process, bidders were asked to cost certain options. One of those was the half hourly off-peak service between Cardiff and London. It should not be assumed that the half hourly off-peak services between Cardiff and London will not form part of the new franchise specification. Decisions will be made on the basis of best value for money, but no decisions will be made until the true costs are known.
</p>

<a name="51101-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies, in welcoming the Bill, asked a number of searching questions. We talked about the Conwy Valley line and the Welsh Assembly Government recently received Network Rail&#039;s revised cost report on the upgrade to the valley line that will be needed to carry heavy slate waste on that route. My noble friend said that the Bill will provide less than a fully integrated transport system.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The Bill, together with powers in the Railways Act 2005, will give the Assembly a coherent and comprehensive set of transport powers for the first time, which is to be welcomed. My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies raised an important point about sustainability&#151;meaning the inclusion of the word &quot;sustainable&quot; in &quot;general transport duty&quot; in Clause 1(1)(a). The word &quot;sustainable&quot; was added to the Bill as a result of the pre-legislative scrutiny. It emphasises the commitment to sustainability in Section 121 of the Government of Wales Act.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>My noble friends Lord Prys-Davies and Lord Rowlands both mentioned finance. If money is ring fenced for transport as a result of Andrew Davies&#039;s review, is &#163;8 billion enough and is there any additional funding for transport within the Assembly budget? The &#163;8 billion is the funding identified for transport in the Assembly&#039;s budget over the next 15 years. Of course, it would be possible to spend more on transport, but the funding will deliver a major transport programme making integrated transport a reality throughout Wales.

<a name="51101-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, as I said at the beginning of the debate, any idea that comes up during the course of the evening will be carefully considered, and we have made a note of that one.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked about passenger rail services to Deeside industrial park. The Assembly is in discussion with the north Wales local authority consortia on rail services in north-east Wales and is awaiting the outcome of a detailed study. The noble Lord also makes the point, which we totally agree with, that the development of air services within Wales is an extremely good idea.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands asked whether the powers in the Railways Act 2005 were the same in Scotland as in Wales, in relation to the franchise and funding. The brief answer to that is no, they are not the same. The Welsh rail network is much more closely integrated with the network in England than is the case for Scotland. The arrangements will enable the Assembly to achieve its objectives by allowing it to determine the pattern of rail services in Wales for the first time. The Assembly will also be able to ensure that its requirements are met in terms of developing the network.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Crucially, my noble friend Lord Rowlands asked about the transfer of funding from the Department to the Assembly for Wales, and the border franchise. Yes, a transfer is under discussion between my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Transport, and the Assembly. It will represent the agreed current cost of rail services for which the Assembly takes responsibility&#151;for example, excluding the few England-only services. As far as the timescale is concerned, the aim is to reach agreement to enable the transfer in the 2006&#150;07 supply estimates. The annual amount of &#163;120 million plus was announced in 2003, when the ATW franchise was agreed uplisted by inflationary indices.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>My noble friend Lord Anderson asked a very important question&#151;which I will not attempt to answer now&#151;on the comparison of relevant powers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_193"></a>

over transport between the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. As I said at the beginning, to answer that in detail would prolong this debate, if not into the small hours, much later than we are all prepared to go. I will write to him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="51101-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend at least confirm that as a result of the changes in the Railways Act 2005 there is indeed a significant transfer of responsibilities and powers to the Assembly on railway matters?
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="51101-20_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, yes, I can confirm that and am most grateful to my noble friend for making that point.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>My noble friend Lord Anderson also asked about the cross-border considerations of the strategy development. The Bill contains a statutory requirement on the Assembly to consult with local authorities in England that border Wales, as well as with Welsh authorities, on the Welsh transport strategy. Nothing in the Bill as drafted will give the Assembly any powers over English services, but it would be required to consider cross-border issues in the development and implementation of its transport policies.

</p>

<a name="51101-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>My noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno said that there is no mention of rail in the Bill, so how could it possibly be an integrated system? He is sitting there nodding, so I will now try to tell him. We have already really dealt with this in other speaking notes. Rail is covered in general in the transport duty in Clause 1 and will be included in the Wales Transport Strategy. However, this is obviously an issue that will run for a time and I expect that we will be returning to it in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The noble Lord also asked where the subsidies are coming from if there is no new money and how the Assembly could possibly afford all these costs. I can confirm that the funding will come from the Assembly&#039;s transport budget. The Assembly Government have set out their transport priorities in their &#163;8 billion, 15-year transport programme.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>As I said, any questions that I have not answered will be answered by the very helpful officials before Committee. As I said at the beginning, if there are any issues that the noble Lords would like to discuss with me or the Bill team, we would welcome that. We greatly look forward to returning to many of these interesting points in Committee.
</p>

<p>Clause 14 [<i>Registration of greens</i>]:
</p>


<p><a name="gc_st_0"></a>
<a name="51101-20_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Vinson </b>   moved Amendment No. 45:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 7, line 16, leave out &quot;or (3)&quot; and insert &quot;, (3) or (3A)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>The noble Lord said: It is a great honour to open the batting today. In moving Amendment No. 45, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 56, the purpose of which is to facilitate the donation of land as village or town greens.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>I speak from some minor experience in this matter because my family is in the process of trying to donate a piece of land in the middle of a village and has found the process extremely complex. I am aware that many people could be put off by the current procedures, which mean that you cannot get inalienability on the land until it is finally registered, some 20 years after you make the gift. That means that there is always the danger of the holding party of that piece of land being tempted to sell it for some building purpose or for another purpose in the mean time. Without inalienability, people will tend to think twice before they make such a donation.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>The amendments that I have been advised to table would enable early dedication, as opposed to registration, and would cut down on the considerable hassle involved in giving land, thereby improving the flow of land to town and village greens. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>
<a name="51101-20_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I support the general thrust of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment and shall speak to Amendments Nos. 46 and 57, which stand in my name and aim to achieve the same objective. If the owner of a piece of land wishes it to be a town or village green and the local community through the parish council, for example, is in agreement with that, it should be possible for it to become a town or village green without having to wait for 20 years. Under the Bill,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;a significant number of the inhabitants&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>for 20 years.
</p>

<a name="51101-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>The difference between my amendments and those of the noble Lord is that the noble Lord suggests that the process should be done by deed, while my amendment merely suggests that the land can be registered as a town or village green through the registration process. The second proposal would be easier and less expensive; on the other hand, I shall not complain very much if the Government prefer the first one. I hope that they understand the problem.

</p>

<a name="51101-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>When we discussed an earlier clause last week, we had an interesting discussion about the express grant of land, during which we all learned what the phrase &quot;express grant&quot; might mean. I am not sure that I understand it fully, but we had a convincing explanation from the Minister. It would allow an owner of land to enter into some kind of deed or other legal document by which it would be possible for the land to become common land. So we have been assured that the Bill already contains such provisions, or similar provisions, in the case of common land&#151;an owner can dedicate his land as a common, by some process&#151;and it would be illogical if the process were not to be carried through in the case of town or village greens. In fact, they may be more likely to be dedicated in practice, as there must be many occasions on which a village clearly needs a village green and does not have one and when the owner is prepared the land to be a village green. The Minister is nodding with enthusiasm, or certainly with some vigour, so I shall say no more and look forward to hearing what he has to say in reply to the amendments.

<a name="51101-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I declare an interest as a cricketer of some 40 summer seasons. I support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves but if, as he says, it is not possible to accept it, I shall most certainly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Vinson. The proposal is only right and proper and would add to the character of our countryside.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="51101-21_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  I am glad that we can start off on a friendly note, and I shall continue on a particularly friendly note. The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, would enable the owner of any piece of land voluntarily to dedicate it by deed as a town or village green. Similarly, amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would enable the owner of any piece of land voluntarily to direct that it should be registered as a town or village green.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>Some noble Lords will know from our 2002 policy statement that it is government policy that landowners should be able to register land voluntarily as a town or village green so that it may acquire the status of a green and the protection that that brings to the land for the future. It follows that we have considerable sympathy with the aim behind the two pairs of amendments. We cannot accept them in their current form, but we certainly see some merit in the thinking behind them. I undertake to give them further consideration before Report and so I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment today and await future events.

<a name="51101-21_spmin1"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  Perhaps I may ask the Minister for a little clarification. When a town or village green is dedicated and the land is registered, presumably the ownership remains with the person who hands it over. Some of these places might well be a market cross that, at the same time, is the caput of the manor, and I wonder whether the measure would have any effect in that regard.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_12"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 47, I shall speak also to four other amendments in the group. It is a fairly long group, and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I go through them carefully.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>Amendments Nos. 47 and 52, which concern lines 18 and 23 on page 7 of the Bill, would leave out the words &quot;significant number&quot; and insert &quot;majority&quot;. According to the Explanatory Notes on the Bill, Clause 14 sets out the circumstances in which land may be registered as a new town or village green with a change to the existing law in the light of the Court of Appeal judgment in <i>Oxford County Council </i>v<i> Oxford City Council</i> and another case.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>Subsection (2) of the clause aims to make it clear that where &quot;a significant number&quot; of the inhabitants of any locality have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right for 20 years or more, use must have continued only up to the date of the application to register the land as a town or village green rather than up to the date of registration itself. The aim of these probing amendments is to test what the noble Lord and his team mean by the term &quot;a significant number&quot; used in subsection (2)(a). According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, &quot;significant&quot; means &quot;full of meaning or import, highly expressive or suggestive&quot;, and I am not sure which the noble Lord will go for.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us how he envisages that the measure will work in the context of the clause. What percentage of inhabitants would be <br>&nbsp;<br>

considered &quot;significant&quot;? Does it have to be at least half of the local population of the village, parish or valley? What criteria will the commons registration authority use to decide whether the application has been made by a significant number, and what proof do those individuals have to provide that the activity has occurred?
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>Further, will &quot;significant&quot; be considered differently for different pastimes and sports, or will the one phrase be used for all? For example, it needs only one person to walk a dog but a minimum of 14 people for a seven-a-side football game, which I know the noble Lord enjoys. If the sports are effectively club sports&#151;football, rugby or running&#151;will they be considered significant only if the individuals are linked to an actual sports club, or will informal sports groups be able to apply as well? How wide will the definition of &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;pastimes&quot; be? Chess, for example, is classified as a sport. If chess were played outside for 20 years, would that enable an application to be made under this provision? That is frivolous, but I think that the noble Lord gets my drift.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>Amendments Nos. 49 and 54 would leave out &quot;as of right&quot; and insert,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>&quot;with the permission of the landowner&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>The phrase &quot;as of right&quot; does not appear in the dictionary that I had. It is difficult to analyse or exemplify. What about a hotel guest who wants to go out on the town and helps himself to a front-door key &quot;as of right&quot;? Not every hotel owner or manager would necessarily agree. Similarly, a young person living with his parents and using the phone &quot;as of right&quot; might find himself in trouble if the person he was ringing was abroad and his parents were not so keen on wasting money in that way. I should like a clarification, replacing &quot;as of right&quot; with the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;with the permission of the landowner&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>There will be landowners who will be pleased to allow things to happen, but some will probably be glad to lose some of the responsibility on a piece of ground that the village youngsters have always had permission to use. It seems unreasonable, however, to saddle some landowners with the cost of defending an application based on the use of &quot;as of right&quot;. People might regularly exercise themselves or their dogs, using a frisbee, a ball or even a football in a field through which passes a right of way but which is some miles from the owner&#039;s dwelling. Would that constitute &quot;as of right&quot;?
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>Amendment No. 51 follows the same line of thought; it tries to tease out what the Government intend to be valid grounds for an application to the commons registration authority. Would most days of the week, in every week of the past 20 years be enough? Would it be sufficient to claim most weeks during those past 20 years? Or would it be regarded as satisfactory were there to be a claim that during a heavy snowfall over the past two decades, villagers took sledges and tin trays to the land and the landowner sometimes brought his children to join in? It is a grey area.

<a name="51101-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>The average town or village in England has grown considerably since the 1980s. Land is now contiguous to dwellings and may have been quite separate some 20 years ago. It is important that the legislation, which may deprive some people of the use of land, should be clear and unambiguous concerning the qualifications of the characteristics the Government have in mind regarding the provisions.
</p>

<a name="51101-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>Amendment No. 59 addresses one of the many issues regarding regulations. For a landowner to exercise what may prove to be a perfectly valid right over his land, he would be required to act via the regulations. What action do the Government anticipate the owner having to take in the event that he wishes to prevent the use of the land as a right when, as we read, there &quot;may&quot; be action specified in the regulations? Do the Government mean for us to assume that in the end there might not be action specified in the regulations? Will actions be specified in the regulations and, if so, what will they be and why are they not in the Bill? I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>
<a name="51101-22_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I support the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves, who may speak to them himself. Noble Lords who were there will remember that we debated the issue at length during the passage of the CROW Act and came to a happy conclusion. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that we need greater definition of various terms. To that end, I have tabled Amendment No. 50 because I am not clear about what would qualify as a &quot;pastime&quot; and what would be regarded as &quot;recreation&quot;, and whether or not it would disallow some activities.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>As to the amendments of my noble friend Lord Greaves, I would underline Amendment No. 58. There are many reasons why an area of land may be temporarily closed, even for a long period, and the people in the neighbourhood or the locality may have a great deal of trouble with such applications.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has said that her amendment is a probing amendment. It would of course be virtually impossible to find a &quot;majority&quot;, and a &quot;significant number&quot; is a much safer phrase. However, the questions that she raises are the correct ones. If elections were decided by majority, the Government would not be in power today.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="51101-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am not sure that we want to go into that debate in too much detail in the Grand Committee. However, I support the comments of my noble friend.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>I have two amendments in the group&#151;Amendments Nos. 55 and 58&#151;but, before speaking to them, I should say that I welcome the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I do not agree with them all, but she has done the Committee a favour by drawing out the issues so that they can be discussed. As to whether it should be a &quot;significant number&quot; or a &quot;majority&quot; of people in a locality, as we will see with the next group of amendments, defining a &quot;locality&quot; is difficult enough without having to produce a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mechanism for finding a majority of people in that locality. So, regardless of the principle of the matter, with which I have some problems anyway, in practice the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments might be difficult to carry out.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>Amendment No. 55 would increase the opportunities for applicants to register land as a green. The Bill requires use for lawful sports and pastimes to continue for such periods as may be defined in regulations. When the law was amended by Section 98 of the CROW Act&#151;which I remember with affection from five years ago&#151;the Government indicated that they would introduce regulations to cover it, but to date they have not done so. They now never will because they are repealing Section 98 in favour of what is contained in the new Bill.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said, there has been a recent Court of Appeal judgment on the registration of a green at Trap Grounds in Oxford that has left this part of the law in a certain degree of turmoil. The judges ruled that the words &quot;continue to do so&quot; in the CROW Act amendments to the 1965 Act meant that the use for lawful sports and pastimes must continue right up to the date of the registration of the land. That clearly provides the owners of land with the opportunity of stopping those uses in the mean time and therefore being able to argue that there is no use as of right at the time the decision is being made. That is clearly a problem, and the Government&#039;s proposals go some way towards tackling it by making the date when you have to show that such uses are taking place the date of the application. Amendment No. 55 suggests that it should be earlier than that&#151;two years before the relevant provision of the CROW Act came into effect. I should like to hear the views of the Minister on that.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>Amendment No. 58 relates to the question of whether the qualifying period in which lawful sports and pastimes have taken place should be continuous. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has tabled an amendment which states that it should be continuous. I understand the reasons for that. This amendment says that it should not have to be continuous when the gaps in the use are due to statutory provisions whereby people are banned by law from taking part in their sports and pastimes, as, for example, with closure of land under the foot and mouth legislation, the obvious recent example.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>There is a precedent. Section 16 of the 1965 Act, relating to claims of prescriptive rights to common, states that where, during a period a right of common claimed over any land was not exercised, where the right claimed is a right to graze animals, the right could not be or was not exercised for reasons of animal health. That is exactly the type of provision that we suggest here. There might be a range of reasons why a piece of land has to be closed for a temporary period, when people cannot carry out their lawful sports and pastimes on it. It would, therefore, seem sensible to state that the qualifying period should not include a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51101-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I had not intended to intervene regarding town and village greens, but, having looked again at the drafting of the Bill, I feel that clarification is needed on a great number of points. First, can my noble friend say what a &quot;significant number&quot; is? Secondly, who are the &quot;inhabitants&quot;? Are they people who have second homes, first homes or barns? What is a &quot;locality&quot;? What is a &quot;neighbourhood within a locality&quot;? What is meant by people having &quot;indulged&quot;&#151;an odd expression&#151;&quot;as of right in lawful sports and pastimes&quot;? By what right? In what Act are &quot;lawful sports and pastimes&quot; defined? Those are serious questions that my noble friend must answer.

<p><a name="gc_st_16"></a>
<a name="51101-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The Commons Registration Act 1965, as amended in 2000, provides for land to be registered as a town or village green if the inhabitants of any locality or of any neighbourhood within a locality have indulged as of right in lawful sports and pastimes on the land for at least 20 years. That provision clearly needs to be replaced because the Bill repeals the whole of the 1965 Act. Clause 14 does that.

<a name="51101-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I am sorry to stop my noble friend in his tracks. We are dealing with the repeal of the 1965 Act, so that the wording of the new legislation must be sensible and understandable by everyone.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_18"></a>
<a name="51101-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I shall continue for the moment; my noble friend will, I hope, be satisfied if he will wait for a minute or two.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a>Applications to register greens face substantial problems because of an unfavourable ruling, as the noble Baroness said, by the Court of Appeal in the Trap Grounds case in Oxfordshire. The appeal is due to be heard by your Lordships&#039; Judicial Committee in late March or early April next year. One aspect of the Court of Appeal&#039;s ruling is that the owner of land can take action after an application is made to register it as a green but before it is registered, to prevent it achieving registration. That is not acceptable, because it effectively makes new registration of genuine greens impossible. As we cannot know what will be the outcome of the Trap Grounds appeal in the House, the wording of Clause 14 differs from that in the 1965 Act and addresses that difficulty. That is the context for the amendments.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has tabled a number of what I take to be probing amendments, and I shall do my best to answer them. I shall deal first with Amendments Nos. 47 and 52. In line with the current definition of town or village green in the 1965 Act, Clause 14 requires that, before registration as a green can take place, a &quot;significant&quot; number of the inhabitants of the locality or neighbourhood in question must have used the land in a qualifying way. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The term &quot;significant number&quot; is construed in relation to the size of the locality or neighbourhood. The inhabitants are the people who live in a locality or neighbourhood, whether it is their first, second or even third home. &quot;Indulged&quot; is indeed an odd word, but it is taken from the 1965 Act definition of farm or village green. I refer my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel to Section 22 of that Act.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>Amendments Nos. 47 and 52 would require the &quot;majority&quot;&#151;not just a significant number&#151;of the inhabitants of the locality or neighbourhood to have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes on land as of right for at least 20 years in order to justify its registration as a town or village green. Making registration dependent on a majority of the inhabitants having used the land in a qualifying way would be unduly restrictive and would set a burden of proof that would be impossible to satisfy in practice.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>The effect of Amendments Nos. 49 and 54 would be that, if a landowner had been considerate enough to give local inhabitants express permission to use his land for lawful sports and pastimes and that arrangement had been in place for at least 20 years, that in itself would justify registration as a town or village green. I fear that for us to accept those amendments&#151;I accept that they are probing&#151;would be to incur the wrath of the landowning community. Clearly, it would not be reasonable for purely permissive use to give rise to registration of land as a green in that way. Conversely, it would be equally unreasonable that the amendment would prevent registration of land as a green on the basis of 20 years&#039; qualifying use as of right&#151;that is, without permission, without force and without secrecy. It is use of that kind, not permissive use, that should give rise to registration.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>Amendment No. 51 would emphasise, by inserting the word &quot;continuous&quot; in subsection (2), that the period of at least 20 years over which local inhabitants must have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes on land as of right to justify its registration as a town or village green is to be a continuous period. We resist the use of the word &quot;continuous&quot; simply because subsection (2) (b) already provides that the exercise of lawful sports and pastimes must continue up to the date of application. The Committee will note that Clause 14(3) (b) goes on to provide that regulations may give effect to what one might call a period of grace after use of right has ceased within which application to register may be made. We shall come to that issue on a later amendment. So Amendment No. 51 is unnecessary. There is no disagreement about the policy or the legal effect that we all seek from this subsection.
</p>

<a name="51101-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>Amendment No. 59 would omit subsection (4) of the clause, which enables regulations to limit the ways in which the owner of land may cause local inhabitants&#039; use of it for lawful sports and pastimes to cease to be &quot;as of right&quot;. We resist the omission of subsection (4) because regulations made under it will provide greater clarity for landowners and for recreational users of their land than exists at present. Where local inhabitants have been using land as of right for lawful <br>&nbsp;<br>

sports and pastimes for a period of time but not as yet for 20 years, the owner will be able to take the action prescribed under the regulations and thereby expressly prevent any further use that takes place being &quot;as of right&quot;. That will ensure that such land cannot be registered as a green. It is important for landowners to have the confidence that there are specific forms of action that they can take and that will have effect.

<a name="51101-23_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Would I be right in saying that, if the owner of the land in question had given rights to people to conduct such activities in written form on a legal basis over 20 years, that would not necessarily result in the achievement of a prescriptive right? In other words, at certain points throughout the 20-year period, written permission has been given by the landowner, so that, at the end of the period, there would not be a prescriptive right. I have not explained it very well, but I think that the noble Lord knows what I am saying.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_20"></a>
<a name="51101-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The answer to the noble Earl&#039;s question is &quot;not necessarily&quot;.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_21"></a>
<a name="51101-23_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I do not think that that satisfies me.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_22"></a>
<a name="51101-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   A written agreement by the owner to access&#151;that is what the noble Earl referred to&#151;would prevent use being &quot;as of right&quot; if given expressly and renewed from time to time. A one-off letter would not be sufficient.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, spoke to Amendment No. 50. It would require that local inhabitants must have indulged in &quot;recreation&quot;, as well as lawful sports and pastimes on land claimed as green. Sports and pastimes may overlap slightly, but, between them, they cover all forms of recreation. Therefore, we resist the amendment. Inserting the words &quot;and recreation&quot; would imply that recreation was a different form of activity from what are referred to in the clause and in the existing greens definition as &quot;lawful sports and pastimes&quot;. The two concepts are interchangeable, and we would not want the clause to imply otherwise.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>The phrase &quot;sports and pastimes&quot; has a very wide meaning. The activities do not need to be organised, something about which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked. Informal games of football and cricket would count, noble Lords will be pleased to hear, as would blackberry picking, walking the dog, kite flying and other family activities.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, spoke to Amendments Nos. 55 and 58. Amendment No. 55 relates to the creation of a period of grace during which an application to register land as a green may be made, even though local people&#039;s use of the land as of right has been ended by the owner of the land. Subsection (3) already enables such a period of grace to be created by regulations. We recognise that putting a provision <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC10"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the Bill to create such a period of grace, instead of making regulations to do so, would have some attractions. There would be additional clarity, and we could avoid delay in implementing the period of grace that was required. It would require careful thought and discussion with interested parties nationwide.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>One of the effects of the amendment, as he has worded it, is that so long as local inhabitants&#039; use of land as a right ended no more than two years before the enactment of Section 98 of the CROW Act, which amended the original definition of town or village green, it would be possible to apply for registration, no matter how far into the future any such application was made. We would want to avoid any suggestion that a period of grace should extend endlessly into the future. That would deprive landowners of their ability to achieve greater certainty about the status of their land, and providing that ability is one aim of this clause. Nevertheless, we want to give further thought, if the noble Lord will allow us, to this set of issues.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>Likewise with his Amendment No. 58. It would prevent an objector to registration of land as a green claiming that a temporary statutory closure of that land had interrupted the required period of use by local people and that a completely new 20-year period subsequent to the statutory closure would be needed in order to justify registration as a green. Again, we sympathise with his underlying intention. Although it is by no means clear that any such interruption by a statutory closure could be a successful claim, it would plainly be unreasonable if that effect were to arise. Statutory closures should not be allowed to stop the clock for the purposes of the 20-year period on which an application to register land as a green relies. We cannot accept the amendment, but we see merit in it, and I undertake to give further consideration and write to the noble Lord in good time before Report on those two amendments.
</p>

<a name="51101-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>I was asked about continuity. What is required is a substantial pattern of recreational use. It does not matter that no one may use the land on a particular day or week or even month. If use is prevented on an ongoing basis, though, it will prevent any successful claim. I hope that I have answered the questions that have been asked.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>The third question relates to picking blackberries.

<a name="51101-23_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   If the land is already registered as a common and people are exercising their rights of common but want to register it as a village green, does anything in the Bill preclude them from applying for it to be a village green in addition to or instead of a common?

<a name="51101-23_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   On the question of who defines &quot;locality&quot;, the Committee will not be surprised to hear that there is case law on the issue. The term relates to recognised administrative units, such as a parish. The term &quot;neighbourhood&quot; is intended to distinguish the position where there is no recognised locality&#151;in other words, in an urban area. &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; may be a better description than a locality.

<a name="51101-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>The issue of whether the actual use that has taken place is sufficient to create a green is a question of fact and degree. The more substantial the use, the more likely the claim is to succeed. That takes us to the blackberry issue and the graphic example that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, gave us about taking blackberries from the land of the noble Earl, Lord Peel.

However, I should still like him to take away the whole question of the definition of &quot;significant&quot; because that really has not been answered fully. Is it a definition of the proportion? How does one judge that and who is to say what is &quot;significant&quot;? Indeed, that observation could apply to one or two more of the answers that we have been given. I do not in any way belittle the Minister&#039;s response; he has gone to a lot of trouble to provide us with answers to the questions that have been raised.

I have no difficulty with that. Rather than spend more time on it at this stage, I suspect that we have gone as far as we can for now. Indeed, when the Minister described blackberry picking as something that is not quite a qualifying activity, I thought that my noble friend Lord Caithness ought to be going about it in a slightly more energetic way; perhaps he would then qualify.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>The Commons Registration Act 1965 referred to &quot;localities&quot;, although I shall not go into the detail. When five years ago we considered the CROW Bill, my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer raised the matter because the problems attached to the word &quot;locality&quot; was causing difficulties. It was being defined by the courts in different ways and thus was preventing the registration of town and village greens where it appeared, on the basis of all the other facts and information available, they should have been registered. As a result the Government brought forward their own amendment to that Bill which introduced the slightly interesting concept of &quot;neighbourhoods within localities&quot;. It was hoped that that would sort out this problem and prevent registrations being refused simply because people were confused. The registration process was being delayed by the difficulties attached to the definition of &quot;locality&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51101-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>In practice, that has turned out not to be the case. I have before me a list of applications to register village greens that have failed as a result of locality and neighbourhood issues over the past two years. These include wonderfully named places such as Hogshaw Wood, Buxton; Magpie Bottom, Bristol; Painters Corner, Chelmsford and Norman Way, Pretty Gate, Colchester. While I do not have the details of these applications and it may be that there may be other issues, it is absolutely clear that the &quot;neighbourhood within locality&quot; point is still causing problems. It ought not to do so. It should be made very clear what Parliament wants in the legislation so that we know which village green applications for registration can be granted and which not.
</p>

<a name="51101-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>I should observe that the list I have just repeated sounds like something from the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. In my view, they ought to have been granted their registrations without further ado simply because of their wonderful names. But perhaps that is a rather simplistic view.

<p><a name="gc_st_46"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment Nos. 61A and 71A, which are also in my name and which are part and parcel. My noble friend Lord Livsey has tabled an amendment to reduce the minimum size from 200 to 50 hectares. I suggest that there should be no lower limit.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>We are here talking about deregistration of common land or of town and village greens or of exchange. I move the amendment to test the Government on why they think that 200 is the right figure. It is an arbitrary figure; any figure is arbitrary. The figure suggested by my noble friend is better, because it is smaller, but why is there a lower limit at all? The value of a piece of land, especially a green in a village, does not necessarily relate to its size. Small pieces of land may perform a valuable local function of recreational amenity, and so on. It would be best not to have a limit.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para1"></a>

<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="51101-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   Amendments Nos. 60, 62 and 72 are linked in respect of the amount of land limited. Amendment No. 60 changes the amount of released land in terms of deregulation and exchange from a limit of 200 square metres to 50. This reduces the amount of land and might possibly result in development.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>We do not have a lot of flat land in Wales. Many times we have heard speakers from England describing their commons. They have no comparison with the vertical commons we have in Wales. A small amount of land can be quite valuable and 200 square metres&#151;certainly to the Welsh commons associations with whom I have discussed these matters&#151;is a large amount.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>Amendment No. 62 says that replacement land larger in area than 50 square metres cannot be registered as common land in place of the leased land. That, obviously, is a <i>quid pro quo</i>. Amendment No. 72 specifies that the leased land is not more than 50 square metres if it is to be registered as common land. That covers the situation overall in those three amendments.

<p><a name="gc_st_48"></a>
<a name="51101-25_spmin1"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  How do we regard the question of size and what is significant? It seems to me that 200 square metres is about 20 metres by 10, which cannot be an awful lot bigger than this room. If so, is that really a significant piece of common land? But of course it may depend on the land&#039;s importance. Some people may be trying to allow an exchange that will give them an extra yard on some activity they are pursuing. Is this what the noble Lord considers to be too large an area? If the area is reduced to 50 square metres, that is much smaller again.

<p><a name="gc_st_49"></a>

satisfactory. I do not know which is better. I will listen to the Minister, but there is a problem regarding these small parcels of land that needs to be dealt with.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_51"></a>
<a name="51101-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The amendments relate to the circumstances in which replacement land has to be provided in any application for a deregistration and exchange order under Clause 15.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will forgive me, I will start with Amendments Nos. 60 and 62, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. Their effect would mean that in any deregistration and exchange proposal where the release land is more than 50 square metres in area, replacement land would have to be offered. Amendment No. 72 also provides that the Secretary of State is to have particular regard in any case where the release land is 50 square metres or less in area as to whether replacement land is being offered. The current threshold in the Bill is 200 square metres.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>We do not agree with the noble Lord and are therefore not content to accept the amendments because we believe it is appropriate for the national authority, whether the Secretary of State or the Assembly, to have the discretion where appropriate to make a deregistration order even when no replacement land is being offered. We accept that there should be limits to that discretion, which is why the Bill proposes that where the area of land to be registered is over 200 square metres, replacement land must be offered in all cases. That seems to strike a reasonable balance. There is a precedent for the <i>de minimis</i> area to be set at 200 square metres or thereabouts in other legislation relating to the deregistration and exchange of common land, namely the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. A further point is that the Bill ensures that the <i>de minimis</i> provision will apply only in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>Clause 15(8), to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, drew our attention, makes it clear that the Secretary of State is to have particular regard to whether replacement land is being offered. The objective behind this provision is to ensure that replacement land is offered whenever possible, even if the release land is less than 200 square metres.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>I have been asked to comment on what the expression &quot;have particular regard to&quot; means. The clause is intended to emphasise that where an application is not accompanied by a proposal for replacement land, the national authority will have particular regard to that fact. No guarantees can be given about the result of such an application, but it leaves the applicant with a very clear steer that if replacement land is available he should provide it. &quot;Careful scrutiny&quot; is another expression which explains, to some extent, what the expression &quot;have particular regard to&quot; means.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>Amendment No. 59A, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would remove the <i>de minimis </i>provision currently contained in the Bill and would require that any application for deregistration under Clause 15 would need to contain a proposal for replacement land. I am afraid this is where, for the first time today, the noble Lord and I must part company. We believe <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is appropriate for the national authority to have the discretion to make a deregistration order when no replacement land is being offered.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>Let me give an example of when that might be a sensible thing to do. An area of common land or green may be entirely landlocked by housing. To remove this provision, which is what is suggested, would be to remove the limited flexibility the national authority has to consider such exceptional cases where the area of land to be deregistered is relatively small&#151;for example, to enable the installation of disabled access to community facilities&#151;and where the proposal is supported overwhelmingly by local people.
</p>

<a name="51101-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>We believe that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that replacement land is offered, save in exceptional circumstances. We appreciate the intention behind the amendments but we believe that we have struck the right balance. We believe that the threshold of 200 square metres is the right level. As the noble Duke said, it is not a large area, probably not much more than the floor area of this room&#151;although there is no doubt somewhere a plan that will tell us exactly the size of this room in square metres. The safeguard in Clause 15(8) will ensure that all applications where no replacement land is being offered will be subject to close scrutiny. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

I will read very carefully what he has said and will consult on it with those who are genuinely concerned about this matter. One wonders whether it will be 200 square metres in the final version of the Bill and whether this may create a loophole where land for development is scarce. It could be the result of consecutive applications, although &quot;careful scrutiny&quot;&#151;to repeat the words used by the Minister&#151;would be given to each application.

<p><a name="gc_st_56"></a>
<a name="51101-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The noble Duke&#039;s amendment provides that any area of replacement land should be the same size or larger than the release land. It is a probing amendment to see what our view is of that proposition.
</p>

<a name="51101-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>We do not think that the discretion of the Secretary of State to grant an order should necessarily be limited in that way. In the vast majority of cases in which the area of release land is over 200 square metres, it will be necessary to provide an equal area of replacement land. However, we do not want to rule out in the real world the possibility that a smaller area of replacement land could be offered in circumstances where the replacement land is of better quality than the release land&#151;that is, better for the exercise of common rights or public access or for any other reason. For example, the release land may be inaccessible and remote for the purposes of recreation, while the replacement land may be on the doorstep of the community and previously unavailable for public use. It would be wrong to turn down an application in such circumstances solely because the replacement land was not of an equal size to the release land.
</p>

<a name="51101-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>The noble Duke mentioned rights of way improvement plans. We do not think that the deregistration of common land could be a proper matter for inclusion in a rights of way improvement plan about improving access to the countryside not removing common land from registers.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, spoke to his amendment. He will, I think, have understood from what I have just said exactly what our argument is.

When the sheep came back in after the foot and mouth outbreak all the wild flowers and birds went again. I am afraid that that is a function of sheep farming on a common.

<a name="51101-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for explaining his amendments, which we support. I also wonder, regarding priority, whether the Minister would cast his mind over how the CROW Act, for example, will override this Bill. We will deal with this matter in later amendments, but it is relevant to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has just raised.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>I have cherry-picked amendments which cover similarly unclear areas in the Bill: the processes of making application for common land, in Clause 15; the functioning of the commons association itself, in Clause 30; and the consent to carry out work on the land, in Clause 37. All of those come under the remit of satisfying both a so-called &quot;public interest&quot; and the &quot;interests of the neighbourhood&quot;, to which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred. My amendments focus on those definitions which cover the same ground. What do the Government mean by &quot;public interest&quot; and &quot;interests of the neighbourhood&quot;? Are they already covered by former legislation? That would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

solve the noble Lord&#039;s problem. Surely, such terms are not distinct from each other. Surely, all neighbourhoods around the country are also part of the &quot;public&quot;, although not all the public are lucky enough to be part of a particular neighbourhood. Will the Minister clarify the definitions? Otherwise, I fear that the Bill will run the risk of becoming vulnerable to an overly subjective use, which will be a <i>carte blanche</i> for the mysterious secondary instruments, whenever they are laid.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>I am also intrigued to discover what the Government mean by &quot;any other matter&quot; that is considered to be relevant. Can the Government provide an example of what that might entail, or are we to assume that any matter at all can be deemed to be relevant, and that that relevance will override the scrutinised legislation? Clause 30(6) informs that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_16"></a>&quot;A commons association must discharge its functions . . . having regard to . . . the public interest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>Does that mean that if a number of members of the public, perhaps, with regard to Clause 14, a &quot;significant number&quot;, apply enough significant pressure to a commons association, that the protection and promotion of sustainable agriculture&#151;the commons association&#039;s functions&#151;will cease? Will that be over and above rights that are held by commoners or individual landowners, unless the remit of the commons association provides such power? We are in a very muddy area.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>Finally, the &quot;public interest&quot; seems to be distinct from the &quot;interests of the neighbourhood&quot; in terms of the work being carried out. I hope that the Minister will shed some light on those definitions in and of themselves. For now, like other noble Lords, I cannot help but wonder whether, in the light of the distinction between the two, the public interest might supersede the interests of the neighbourhood or vice-versa. Perhaps a dual carriageway built across common land might be in the interests of the public, but would override the interests of the neighbourhood. The terms and exchanges of severances would be in the hands not of the public or the neighbourhood, but of the centralised government bodies and the commons associations. This section of the Bill is very confusing.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 70, which leaves out paragraph (c). It closely follows that to page 7 concerning the relative area of release and replacement land. The Minister answered some of those points. I raise the subject of public footpaths. In any gathering of farmers, some will tell you tales of years of effort and expense to remove a pass from the centre of a farmyard to the edge of a field or to 100 feet away. Frequently, the main stumbling block has been the need to persuade one or two people that such a move will not deprive them of their basic rights. We are anxious that the new legislation affecting the business of exchanging one access area with another is not hampered by an undue emphasis on protection of existing rights. Are some city access departments planning to apply for village green status in inner-city areas? If so, is the Minister certain that such moves will not be constrained by that paragraph?

</p>

<a name="51101-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>It may seem strange, but they are linked, so I now move to Clause 15 stand part and apologise to the Minister that I am doing so before his response. Our amendment would remove Clause 15. I have tabled it in response to concern expressed to me that the changes to deregistration and exchange applications imposed by the clause could render the whole process extinct. I should like to give the Minister an opportunity to come back to me on the issue. As I understand it, the exchange procedure is recognised as a useful mechanism that enables an existing piece of registered common land, town green or village green to be deregistered and swapped for another piece of land that is then registered in its place, subject to certain criteria. However, that is usually done to facilitate a landowner&#039;s personal requirements. For instance, it may be to enable an extension to be built to an existing property or farm buildings to be erected in a more convenient position. Alternatively, it may be to enable new housing to take place in an appropriate position.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>The problem is that the clause proposes to introduce an even stricter test of whether such an exchange can take place, which could effectively straitjacket the process. Clause 15(6) and (7), as we have discussed, requires the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to take into account all nature conservation factors in the interests of the neighbourhood and the public interest before permitting such an exchange of land. Will the Minister confirm that, realistically, it will prove practically impossible to satisfy all such requirements so as to enable an exchange of land to take place? That would be much regretted. Meanwhile, the present arrangement provides an element of useful and sensible fluidity that is likely to be lost if the proposal stands part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_63"></a>
<a name="51101-27_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I support what my noble friend said. I listened carefully to the points that she made and it seems to me that the whole process of deregistration and exchange and the flexibility that it has provided in the past has been of immense value. She mentioned housing and enabling new farm buildings to be built. It is essential that that flexibility is retained. We are moving into strange and difficult times in agriculture. Farm diversification schemes are the name of the game. The use of farm buildings is changing and will change ever more.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>There is also a need to provide low-cost housing. Often, the most appropriate places for such housing are the very areas that we are discussing, and so I think that the noble Baroness has raised an important point here. I am sure the Minister agrees that deregistration and exchange and the flexibility that it offers is important, but it strikes me that the Government are now moving in a whole new direction which will make this an increasingly difficult process to enact. I ask the Minister whether it is the Government&#039;s intention to make it more difficult. If so, I should simply like to know why.

<a name="51101-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I welcome the amendments put forward by my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, although I would not support them in their present form if they came to a vote. But it is very useful to probe the question of the relative weight that will be given and the way in which decisions will be made in relation to commoners, the interests of the neighbourhood, conservation interests and the wider public.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>Following the passage of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, probably the most important single interest that the wider public have nowadays is that from the end of last month&#151;that is, from now&#151;all common land is open to rights of access, subject to the provisions of Part 1 of the Act. If there is to be an exchange of substantial, or even quite small, pieces of land in particularly important places, the question of access must clearly be considered. I seek an assurance from the Minister that such a consideration will be given due weight, which, in my view, should be considerable.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_65"></a>
<a name="51101-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We have had an interesting debate around these amendments. In due course, I shall speak to government Amendment No. 71. Indeed, I shall do so at the start because, appropriately, it is grouped with the other amendments.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>Amendment No. 71 seeks to add a further example to Clause 15(7), about which we have heard quite a lot today. That subsection lists some of the issues included under the public interest criteria and we believe that they should include the protection of archaeological remains and features of historic interest. The list, about which I shall say more in a moment, is not intended to be exhaustive, but a better balance is brought to it by including the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_17"></a>&quot;the protection of archaeological remains and features of historic interest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>That also makes the test consistent with the definition of &quot;public interest&quot; in Clause 37(2), which will apply when applications to carry out works are determined under Clause 36. I shall move Amendment No. 71 in due course.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>I turn to the amendments that have been moved and spoken to. They propose changes to the issues that the national authority&#151;that is, the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly in Wales&#151;must consider in determining a deregistration and exchange application under Clause 15.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>I will deal first with Amendments Nos. 64 and 68 in the name of my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel. I say to him straight away that his fast ball or bouncer&#151;whatever he likes to call it&#151;concerning, in effect, devolution will be answered in due course. He was kind enough to say that that does not have to happen today; nor will it. However, it is an important issue which needs a serious answer.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>I know that, in a sense, all these amendments are probing amendments on Clause 15 and the meaning of the clause. Amendments Nos. 64 and 68 would remove the requirement for the national authority to consider <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the interests of the neighbourhood, the public interest and any other factor considered to be relevant. If accepted, they would mean that the national authority would have to consider only the interests of owners, occupiers or common rights holders when considering an application for a deregistration and exchange order. In our view, common land and town and village greens play significant yet different roles for a wide range of people, and are valued for a variety of reasons.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>We believe that, in determining an application under Clause 15, the national authority&#039;s focus should be on the effect of the application on the common or green itself and on all those with an interest in the land, rather than on one particular set of interests. That is why we have deliberately designed the Bill to enable the national authority to take account of all the various interests that might be affected by an application. Of course, they include the interests the owners of the land involved and also of those holding common rights, together with the interests of the neighbourhood and the wider public interest.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>I shall deal with common rights holders when I respond to Amendments Nos. 63 and 69 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. Looking at Amendment No. 64 in more detail, however, it can reasonably be assumed that an application will invariably be in the landowner&#039;s interests, as he will be the applicant. In cases where the same person owns both the release and the replacement land and the land is not subject to rights of common, we do not believe that it would be appropriate for the national authority to have regard only to the landowner&#039;s interests. We consider that the requirement for the national authority to consider other factors provides a necessary level of protection.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>My noble friend Lord Williams asked about the order of priority in Clause 15(7). He may be disappointed with my answer: there is no order of priority. They are all factors to be taken into consideration by the Secretary of State or the Assembly.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>The expression &quot;interests of the neighbourhood&quot; can be defined as meaning the interests of people living on or occupying land close enough to a common to be directly affected by what happens to it.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>I turn to the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford&#151;I have not forgotten the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. The noble Baroness&#039;s Amendments Nos. 65 and 66 would remove the requirement for the national authority to consider the public interest and any other factor considered to be relevant. The noble Baroness will not be surprised to hear that, if the amendments were pressed, I would resist them on the same grounds as I resisted the amendments in the name of my noble friend Lord Williams.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>The effect of Amendments Nos. 65 and 66 would be to limit the issues that the national authority could take into account when determining a deregistration and exchange application. We do not consider it appropriate that the national authority should be constrained in that way. In particular, we believe it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC26"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC26</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

right that the public interest must be one of the factors to be considered because of the wider importance of common land and village greens to the public in general.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>We also believe that Clause 15(6)(d)&#151;that is, any other matter considered to be relevant&#151;serves a useful purpose in allowing the national authority to consider any other factor that it considers relevant. It is impossible to forecast what issues may be raised in individual applications, so we believe that in this instance this catch-all provision is very necessary. After all, it is the Secretary of State or the Assembly in Wales that will decide these issues in each case.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>Amendment No. 70, also in the name of the noble Baroness, would remove the requirement to have regard to the protection of public rights of access to any area of land. We resist this amendment because the public have a legal right of access, on foot, to practically all registered common land, with the exclusion of excepted land and some military training areas. Town and village greens are also areas to which local inhabitants have access for lawful sports and pastimes.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_111"></a>We therefore believe that where the national authority is considering a proposal to deregister an area of land and offer replacement land in its place, the effect of the proposal on any public right of access is a material and very proper consideration. If, for whatever reason, there is no right of access to the release land, that is also a factor, on the other side, that the national authority can take into account.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a> The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked me about the meaning of the expression &quot;public interest&quot;. The phrase signifies the matters of the type that are set out in Clause 15 (7), such as nature conservation, which matter to the public in general. We think it right to refer in subsection (6) to both public interest and interest of the neighbourhood to emphasise that the national authority that will consider those matters must particularly consider the interests of local people, as well as broader considerations.
</p>

<a name="51101-27_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, spoke to Amendments Nos. 63 and 69, which would require the national authority to give primacy to the interests of the common rights holders in considering any application. We accept that the interests of those rights holders are important, and Clause 15(6)(a) requires the national authority to have particular regard to the interests of those exercising right of common; but we do not believe that those interests should be given primacy irrespective of all other factors. Commoners&#039; interests are important, but common land has received special protection in our statute book for nearly 150 years because of its value to the public as a whole. It would not be right to assume that the commoners&#039; interests are paramount in any particular application. Indeed, on a common where rights are no longer exercised it would be odd or peculiar to suggest that those who hold but no longer exercise their rights are to be given special consideration or primacy. I believe that that argument holds water.

</p>

<a name="51101-27_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about exchanges causing sheep enterprises to become uneconomic. Most exchanges, if not almost all, have proved to be of small areas of land. We believe that exchanges of land affecting very large or large areas sufficient to threaten the farmers&#039; occupation will be rare, and the clause already ensures that that would be a very serious matter for the national authority to take into account in making its decision. The noble Baroness and the noble Earl, Lord Peel, asked me if the measure will make exchange more difficult. An applicant for exchange will not necessarily have to show that it is in the interests of all classes of people in subsection (6). They may conflict with one another; for example, if a proposed exchange has a major benefit to a landowner and only very minor disadvantages to the neighbourhood or public interest, the application may well succeed. We do not accept that applications will become extinct or less likely to succeed, but to get the right balance&#151;which, after all, is what is needed for a proper decision to be made&#151;the Secretary of State should consider all relevant matters in considering an application. That is what subsection (6) does, in order to give protection all round.

<a name="51101-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>It is difficult when amendments are all taken together, but I shall say two things. I thank my noble friend Lord Peel for his contribution; he and I are very anxious that the flexibility and the way in which it has worked in the past should be able to continue for everybody&#039;s benefit. My noble friend mentioned diversification, and the Minister, although he is fairly new to his brief, will know well that farmers are increasingly being asked to diversify. The use of farmers&#039; buildings is becoming of prime importance; I am sure that is something that has been raised with the Minister. Perhaps at this stage I should declare an interest as president of the National Farm Attractions Network, which is a very good example of many farmers who have diversified in the ways that we are discussing, and who might well be affected by the provisions of this Bill.

I say to the Minister&#151;in a reasonably charming fashion, I hope&#151;that I am still very unhappy about the broad brush of the wording here and the fact that in Clause 15(7) no one thing takes precedence over another. We are in a nightmare situation. The phrase used was &quot;catch-all&quot; position. I totally agree.

Government need to give further thought to where the public interest conflicts with that of the landowner or the common owner.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>If the public interest is to be taken into account, how will this be done? What system is there? Will a letter be put through everyone&#039;s letterbox saying: &quot;We have it in mind&quot;, and: &quot;Do you support it?&quot;? What about local people&#039;s views? This whole area is unclear, unless I have read it incorrectly.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>The other point I want to raise&#151;although this may be dealt with later, and I apologise if it is&#151;is what happens, when views have been taken, if people do not like the decision that has been arrived at. Is there any form of appeal? How does the Minister, or the person dealing with it, get feedback from the local community, or from those who have direct interests in it? As far as I am aware, that is not included in this subsection. If I am wrong, I apologise.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>We should not leave this part of the Bill in such a general, unsatisfactory manner at this stage. I would be grateful for a little more clarification.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_67"></a>
<a name="51101-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I shall do my best. With regard to the CROW Act, all registered common land was mapped by the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales for the purposes of the new public access arrangements under the CROW Act, where land is added to or removed from the common land register under the new registration and exchange provisions. There may be an expectation that the CROW maps will immediately be updated to reflect these changes. In fact the requirement in Section 10 of the CROW Act is for these conclusive maps to be reviewed at least every 10 years. It is at this 10-year review stage that we intend them to reflect any additions or removals from the register. This is already the position with regard to deregistration and exchange cases. Were we to go down the route of amending the conclusive maps every time there is a change to the register, this would in effect require perpetual modification of these maps, rather than the 10-year cycle set out in the CROW Act. The need for change would not always be straightforward, because the land might still qualify for inclusion if, for example, it were moorland.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>Excepted land, such as houses and gardens, is already exempt from access rights, even if it does appear on the CROW maps. On other land, the CROW arrangements include a local restriction system that, if necessary, can address any real problems that arise on the ground.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>The noble Baroness asked two other questions; first, how the views of the public would be known. There will be a process when an application is made, and part of that process will be the right of interested parties to respond to advertisements of the fact that there is an application and send in their views and opinions. All these will be taken into account by the Secretary of State or the national authority in deciding where the balance lies in allowing or refusing any application.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>Secondly, the legal remedy for those dissatisfied with whatever conclusion is reached, as is true of any dissatisfaction with a decision on administrative law, is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

judicial review. That would be open to those who were dissatisfied if they believed that the decision was outrageous.

<p><a name="gc_st_68"></a>
<a name="51101-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. On the process that he described, is he thinking of a formal consultation period of, say, 12 weeks; or is he thinking of an advertisement being placed in a newspaper so that if you happen to see it, you know that it is going on but if not, you do not?
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>The Minister referred to the fact that the appeal could go to judicial review. As he will know, that is a time-consuming and costly way to deal with the matter. Have the Government considered another way, or is that final?

</p>

<a name="51101-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I make no apology about graziers&#039; rights having priority. The situation is somewhat at odds with the provision of Clause 15(6). There are huge questions of agronomic-economic viability if graziers are unable to put rams out at tupping time. There are problems associated with lambing, which is often done on by-land. There are huge areas of potential conflict. That is why the word &quot;priority&quot; has been included in my amendment. Surely those who have those grazing rights and make a living out of grazing common land ought to be able at least to pursue their main functions and not be overridden by issues that may jeopardise their living. Some of those issues are of prime importance in rural areas, <br>&nbsp;<br>

where wages are low, the average age of farmers is now almost 60 and depopulation of young people is taking place. Do we want the people who are managing the land and making a living from it to become a rare species, as they almost are at present?
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>There are huge sociological issues here that need to be taken into account. I can therefore easily justify the wording of my amendment. I thank the Minister for tabling Amendment No. 71 about archaeology. That is of great importance. I was very interested in the comments of my friend, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, about the National Assembly for Wales, its potential influence and the proprieties of the devolution settlement, such as it is in Wales. It should be a primary consideration.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>I am glad that the Minister has acknowledged that this is a very important issue and that he will give us further information on it. Certainly I, for one, would have preferred to see a Welsh commons Act. Indeed, the Minister may remember that during our previous Committee session I proposed that there should be a Welsh commons commissioner because nearly 10 per cent of Wales is common land. One-third of the constituency that I represented&#151;Brecon and Radnorshire&#151;is common land and in places it goes up to almost 3,000 feet. So this issue is of great importance in Wales and it needs to be treated as such.
</p>

<a name="51101-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, made some very important points on some of the amendments, and I was particularly interested in what the noble Earl, Lord Peel, said about diversification, low-cost housing and the importance of flexibility. That cannot be underrated at present when the whole question of economic diversification in rural areas is becoming more and more important. With those words, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 63.

In proposed new subsection (9A)(b) of the amendment, we would also require a favourable impact assessment to be made of the agricultural sustainability&#151;or, if the Minister prefers, agricultural viability&#151;of the replacement land. We believe that those processes make a great deal of common sense.
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_132"></a>I know of problems in certain places, and I shall give the Committee two examples. For some reason, some urban local authorities have turned a blind eye to the creation of golf courses on common land. Perhaps there has not been a very cohesive commons association or perhaps common land was claimed at one point but mistakes were made in the registration as a result of the Commons Registration Act 1965. Indeed, in one case that I can cite, a large chunk of the best grazing on a piece of common land has been converted into a golf course and that has caused much upset in the courts in a certain part of Wales. The local authority was extremely lax in its application, even though it was a commons registration authority. It paid hardly any attention to its duties because it was bogged down by huge questions of unemployment and so on in other areas.


</p>

<a name="51101-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_133"></a>In another case, a private landowner in a different part of Wales decided to ignore the commoners&#039; rights and constructed a common land golf course. At least, he is attempting to do so&#151;it is not complete. The amendments would put a stop to such things and ensure that everything was done in an orderly manner. I beg to move.

<a name="51101-29_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  For the benefit of the Committee, I re-emphasise my interest as a farmer&#151;someone who, in a manner of speaking, has relied on an income from farming for a great many years. I sympathise in many ways with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. At the same time, we need an idea of how we define &quot;non-agricultural&quot;. I should be very interested to know how the noble Lord would do so. Who says what non-agricultural includes and what it excludes?
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_134"></a>Definitions aside, I should be interested to hear how the so-called favourable impact assessment would be carried out. Surely there would be a need to employ an agricultural expert to carry out the tests, and that would require access to funding by the commons association or the designated body which was asked to find out. Furthermore, how will agricultural sustainability be accurately assessed? Will there be another resort to the ever-present regulations?
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>I suppose the simple test is whether the land provides grazing&#151;that is usually the main way of looking at agriculture. Economic viability is up in the air at present because, if you divide off the single farm payment, the actual viability of the livestock is quite difficult to determine. So long as there is grazing, that is at least one element.

<a name="51101-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>The sentiment of the amendment&#151;to encourage sustainable production and support agriculture&#151;is a good one but its lack of clarity means that it will defer again to subjective interpretation.

<p><a name="gc_st_78"></a>
<a name="51101-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, made plain, his amendment would provide that an application for a deregistration and exchange order could not be considered if the release land were to be used for non-agricultural purposes unless planning permission had been granted and a favourable impact assessment had been made on the agricultural sustainability of the replacement land. At this point, I pray in aid the comments of the noble Duke on the difficulties in that area.
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>The purpose of the deregistration and exchange provisions is to ensure that when a person wants to deregister land and provide replacement land, the replacement land is in fact suitable to be registered in its place. If the Secretary of State or the National Assembly has judged the replacement land to be suitable, we see no reason to be concerned about the use to which the release land is put after it has been deregistered. The release land will, of course, continue to be protected by other mechanisms, such as the planning system.
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>In speaking to the amendment, the noble Lord himself recognised the complexities that exist in terms of current use on land. The release land could be any type of land; it may not be in agricultural use or subject to any rights of common. For example, the release land may have been used for entirely private purposes, such as a garden, and the landowner may wish to regularise the situation by providing alternative land in substitution. I wonder whether the unauthorised developments to which the noble Lord referred might be more readily resolved by the Government&#039;s position. In such circumstances, it would be quite inappropriate to require the test set out in the amendment to be applied to such release land. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51101-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   In response to the comments made by both the noble Baroness and the noble Duke, certain matters could be resolved quite easily. The noble Duke asked about the possibility of an impact assessment being made on agricultural sustainability. Clearly either the Secretary of State or the National Assembly would have the personnel who would be able to provide the expertise to resolve such a matter. The planning application referred to in this amendment should be approved by the local planning authority for the proposed non-agricultural use.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_81"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 74, I shall also speak briefly to Amendment No. 76. The amendment seeks to ensure that the registration authority acts within a given period of time and thus does not allow a backlog of work to build up once the decision to grant permission has been made. Nothing is available to us that delineates how the process will work. It seems reasonable, however, to assume that the national authority will post, fax or email the order to the relevant office or person at the registration authority. Once it has arrived, we believe that there should be a specific requirement for the amendment of the register to take place within a given period of time so that a relevant date is produced.
</p>

<a name="51101-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>Amendment No. 76 echoes the same principle as that in the earlier amendment. It seeks to put a time limit on the removal of the release land. The fact that the action required to be taken is the responsibility of the local authority rather than the individual does not remove the necessity for the deed to be completed within a reasonable length of time. Defra Bills relating to the duties and obligations of farmers and landowners are full of time limits&#151;and in most cases rather shorter than the period I have suggested here. We feel that a time limit should be set in these provisions. I beg to move.

<a name="51101-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Of course, we appreciate the motives behind the tabling of these amendments but we do not think that they are necessary. We cannot see any reason why the commons registration authority would not act with due speed to amend the register as a result of an order from the Secretary of State or National Assembly, but to require them to do so within a specified period, irrespective of the circumstances, would be inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>I am unclear how the amendments would necessarily improve on the position already set out in the Bill. In the case of a straightforward amendment to the register, we would expect the authority to act promptly on receiving an order, and a delay of 40 days may seem excessive. However, if the amendment were not carried out within 40 days, what sanction would arise? By virtue of Clause 16(9), the Bill already provides that the exchange land application is not effective until the registration authority has amended its register, so there would be no obvious penalty if the authority failed to comply.

The amendments have been sensibly grouped together as they all refer to the National Trust. As the clauses stand, they enable the national authority in certain situations to amend, revoke and repeal by order the parts of the National Trust Acts 1907 to 1971 that deal with common land. Many local and personal Acts typically deal with a particular local common. The National Trust Acts are fundamentally different because they cover large areas of commons nationally and do not apply to the discreet local commons. Consequently, any amendment to the parts of the National Trust Acts dealing with commons will affect large numbers of commoners.

the provisions. If the parts of the National Trust Acts dealing with common land are to be amended in future, the full parliamentary process should be adhered to.

The amount of common land that the National Trust has is substantial, as the noble Baroness said, and it is important that the commoners&#039; rights are taken account of. For example, the National Trust administers large tracts of the Brecon Beacons and, in our part of the world, some coastal land as well. The matter needs detailed consideration, and I agree with the noble Baroness that the measure seems to have been parachuted in here. I support the amendment.

<a name="51101-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>The powers affected by these amendments, in Clauses 16, 34 and 42, have innocent purposes, which I will try to explain. Orders under Clause 16 arise from the administrative decision of the national authority on an individual application under Clause 15. Any such order would usually contain consequential or supplementary provisions necessary to reflect the specific circumstances of the land subject to the order. We expect that orders for the exchange of land will sometimes be sought for land regulated under a local Act of Parliament&#151;such as, for example, the Nettlebed and District Common Preservation Act 1906. It is impossible to generalise about how such an Act should apply to the replacement land. For example, if the Act provides that only part of the release land may be used for playing cricket, is the whole of the replacement land to be used for cricket, or part of it, or none at all? Clause 16(7)(c) enables the order to make supplementary provision to deal with such matters.

<a name="51101-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>We believe it unlikely that we would ever need to make provision in a Clause 16 order for the National Trust Acts, because those Acts do not have effect in relation to particular localities, but set out some general principles which relate to all National Trust land, or all such land of a particular class, such as common land. It is perhaps possible that the trust itself would wish to exclude the application of the trust Acts to replacement land given in exchange&#151;for example, if it did not wish the replacement land to be subject to the controls on works in Section 23 of the 1971 Act, although I feel sure we would wish to look at such a request very carefully.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>A particular safeguard for the National Trust, in the context of the amendment to Clause 16, is that applications in relation to trust land under Clause 15 must be made by the trust itself, so it is unlikely that an order would be made which was inconsistent with the trust&#039;s objectives, and if one were proposed, the trust could withdraw its application.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>Under Clause 34, provision is made to amend or repeal local Acts if the national authority thinks it desirable in consequence of functions conferred on a commons association, although that power can be exercised only insofar as any local Act relates to the management or maintenance of common land or the exercise of rights of common. We have in mind that, for example, when a common is managed by a board of conservators under a 19th century order of regulation confirmed by Act of Parliament, the commoners and other interests may prefer to reconstitute themselves as a commons association under Part 2, in order to acquire modern functions and powers. If there was a consensus in favour of proceeding, the Secretary of State would be able to revoke the order establishing the conservators.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_160"></a>Again, it is difficult to see how or why provision could need to be made in relation to the National Trust Acts. It is certainly true that the Acts place some fairly limited duties on the Trust to manage its common land in a certain way; for example, commons must be kept unenclosed, the trust must resist encroachments, and it has limited powers to manage and improve the land. Those powers and duties are very similar to those applying to the many open spaces managed by local and national park authorities under the Open Spaces Act 1906, but Clause 34 contains no powers to amend public general Acts of this nature.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_161"></a>In the context of the amendment to Clause 34 the trust has, in any event, a particular safeguard. Any provision made under Clause 34 would be made in an establishment order which establishes a commons association under Clause 25. An order under Clause 25 cannot be made unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is substantial support for it, having particular regard to the views of key interests in the common, including that of the National Trust in its capacity as an owner, if it were the owner in any particular case, or as a body with statutory functions relating to the management of the land. If the trust had significant objections to the establishment of a commons association in respect of land for which it was responsible, then the Secretary of State may be reluctant to make an order. In practice, we think such opposition would be unlikely. The trust&#039;s experience is that 44 per cent of its common land designated as sites of special scientific interest is failing to meet the PSA target, and the establishment of statutory commons associations on such commons can only assist rather than hinder the achievement of target condition.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_162"></a>Nor do we think it likely that in an order made under Clause 34 we would wish to make amendments to the National Trust Acts. The Acts set out the constitution and duties of the trust. To amend those Acts would be to interfere with the rights of the landowner. If he will forgive me, it would be little different from my telling <br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Earl, Lord Peel, that we were going to establish a commons association for his moorland commons and, in consequence, he was to give up shooting and turn to shepherding instead. We are not likely to do that.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>Lastly I turn to Clause 42. This provision enables us to amend local Acts,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_24"></a>&quot;for the purpose of making provision about works on common land&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>We expect that these powers may be exercised in order to ensure that the controls on works in any local Acts are rendered consistent with the new regime. That is because there are many such Acts&#151;26,000 since the 18th century alone&#151;and we cannot know what provisions they contain. So Clause 42 enables us to amend local legislation as and when provisions come to light to ensure that local Acts are consistent with Part 3.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>It is quite true that the powers in Clause 42 apply to the National Trust Acts. Yet with the agreement of the trust we have already made provision in Paragraphs 3 to 4 of Schedule 3 for the amendment of the trust Acts to bring them into line with Part 3.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>In short, we do not think it remotely probable that the powers in any of these three clauses would be used to alter the trust Acts. I can almost hear noble Lords asking the question: &quot;Why then do we not accept the amendments?&quot;. The answer is this: the trust in this instance is no different from other bodies which may or may not be affected by these powers. If we are to have a saving for the trust, why not one for the water companies, which are subject to public interest obligations in the management of their estates? Or for Surrey County Council which, like many local authorities, is subject to both national and local legislation in the management of its open spaces. Or, for that matter, for the many estates which are governed by private, local or personal Acts of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_167"></a>Public general Acts of Parliament contain numerous clauses similar to those we are considering today. They are included in recognition of the vast number of local, private and personal Acts and the impossibility of understanding all that they contain. We have been unable to find a single instance in which a public general Act contains a saving excluding the operation of a similar provision for the National Trust. That is because these powers are exercised rarely and cautiously, in consultation with the bodies whose interests are affected and subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="51101-30_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>We do not believe that the National Trust has anything to fear. I have tried to explain how these provisions are highly unlikely to be applied to the trust Acts, but the proper convention is that these powers should be no less constrained for the trust than for any other body. I hope that I have dealt adequately with the legitimate concerns that have been raised about these amendments. I hope too that the noble Baroness <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_25"></a>After Clause 16, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP OF COMMON LAND

<br>
(1)   Each commons registration authority shall inform Her Majesty&#039;s Land Registry of all common land in its area.


<br>
(2)   The land registry shall notify the relevant commons association of any proposal to exchange ownership of common land.


<br>
(3)   Regulations shall provide for&#151;


<br>
(a)   a statutory period of objection of no less than six weeks; and


<br>
(b)   a requirement on the vendor of common land to declare any evidence of common grazing rights.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_95"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 78 would insert a new clause in regard to changes in ownership of common land. I shall refer to it as the &quot;Land Registry&quot; clause&quot;. It has been reported to me by a number of people that there is poor communication between the Land Registry, the commons registration authorities and the commoners associations. Land has been sold and registered by the Land Registry but not everyone knows that this has taken place. This causes a great deal of heated response, particularly from commons associations which do not realise that they have a new landlord.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_172"></a>The amendment seeks to open up a method of communication all round. This is because, under subsection (1),


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_26"></a>&quot;Each commons registration authority shall inform Her Majesty&#039;s Land Registry of all common land in its area&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>Clearly the commons registration authority will also be involved, particularly where there is any proposal to exchange ownership of common land. This is important.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>Subsection (3) contains a requirement for regulations to be made because, if it is known that the ownership of common land is to be exchanged, people and organisations such as the commons associations should at least be given a statutory period of objection. I have suggested in the amendment that that period should be six weeks. Secondly, there is a requirement on the vendor of common land to declare any evidence of common grazing rights.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>The present situation is that some land has been sold but the owner of the land, the vendor, has not declared the fact that there are common grazing rights on the land. I describe such people as &quot;rogue owners&quot;&#151;although I should make it quite clear that there are certainly no such people in this room. The odd person appears to be taking advantage of the situation by not declaring the grazing rights and, because of that, the value of the land sold may be higher. That is only a suggestion or an implication of what might be the reason for doing so.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>Common land graziers have asked me to raise this issue with the Committee and to table the amendment because, in a number of instances, the ownership of common land has changed and they have not known a thing about it. The Land Registry has not been prepared to inform people&#151;it will not co-operate, as I understand it&#151;that that has taken place. We do not quite understand why this should be, but we suspect there is a technological reason: the Land Registry has state-of-the-art electronic means of registration whereas the poor old commons associations are still working on, shall we say, rather more traditional ways of keeping records.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>We feel that this is a rounded amendment which will ensure better communications so that at least everyone will know what is going on. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_97"></a>
<a name="51101-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   The noble Earl has asked an interesting question. There may be some implications in the sale of the land and there ought to be at least an opportunity to comment on it. Perhaps &quot;objection&quot; in the amendment is a little strong.

</p>

<a name="51101-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>The noble Earl should not be too alarmed but there have been cases of multi-national companies wishing to purchase lord of the manorships on some common land, and some companies have acquired interests and become lords of the manor.

But there are instances of other large organisations taking an interest in this and we feel that there should be at least a period when comment can be made and that people should know what is going on.

<p><a name="gc_st_98"></a>
<a name="51101-31_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his reply but I fail to see the difference between the sale of common land and the sale of ordinary land. If an individual was selling an estate that was subjected to let, say, five farms, all with full tenancy rights, it would not be the normal practice to give the tenant farmers six weeks to object to the sale. As such, I do not see there is much difference between that and selling a common. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has other ideas.

There is a market in the sales of lord of the manorships but they are advertised in places such as London, well away from where the action takes place. I pray in aid that fact in my argument.

What is the timescale within which the Chief Land Registrar has to act, and how long do the commons registration authorities then have to remove registrations? Will this removal come within the transitional period? How much work will be involved? Will there be any need to advertise the procedure?

<p><a name="gc_st_101"></a>
<a name="51101-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am grateful to those who have spoken in this debate. Amendment No. 78, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, would introduce a new clause imposing an obligation on the Land Registry to notify to the commons registration authority proposals for the transfer of title to common land. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC42"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 116, spoken to by the noble Duke, relates to the requirement on the commons registration authority to delete an entry in the ownership section of the register when it receives notice that title to the land has been registered for the first time with the Land Registry. As the noble Duke told the Committee, it is a probing amendment.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>The Bill already contains powers in paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to re-enact Section 12(b) of the 1965 Act, which requires the commons registration authority to delete any registration of ownership in the ownership section of the commons registers when it receives notification of first registration of title by the Land Registry.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>We acknowledge that the system of notification is not 100 per cent effective at present. That is because the Land Registry does not always know when an application for first registration of title relates to registered common land or registered green&#151;not least because it is not custodian of the commons registers and it is by no means always obvious from title documents that the application land is common land. However, we are working with the Land Registry to improve its access to information about the extent of registered land so that the notification system can be more reliable. There may be opportunities for the registry to use the data already compiled by the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales under Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, so that it is aware of what is and what is not registered as common land.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_184"></a>However, our view is that it is not necessary, or even reasonable, to go further and to require every transfer of title affecting common land to be notified. If a substantial area of common land is sold to a new owner, then I do not doubt that the commoners will hear of it soon enough. I also think it would be unreasonable to cause the owner of common land to be hostage to objections regarding a possible sale. That would be an unwarranted interference in his freedom to dispose of his own property, although I am not quite sure on what grounds any objection to such a sale might be made.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>Subsection (3)(b) of the proposed new clause in Amendment No. 78 would impose an obligation on the seller, on the vendor, to &quot;declare any evidence of common grazing rights&quot;, which presumably means a requirement to advise a potential purchaser of the existence of any registered rights of common. That, we consider, is a matter which the purchaser should establish as part of the searches conducted on a purchase of undeveloped land, and we are seeking to integrate the present statutory search of the commons registers into the existing property search form, which is rather better known to property conveyancers. This should mean that conveyancers will be more likely to undertake a search of the commons registers as part of the usual pre-purchase routines, and consequently the purchasers are less likely to claim that they were unaware of the special status of land as registered common land or town or village green when they bought it.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 116, I repeat what I said in the debate a week ago on Clause 2 of the Bill that we consider the ownership of land should be recorded in the register of title kept by the Land Registry. The register of title provides conclusive evidence of title to land.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_188"></a>Because of the gradual migration of ownership information to the register of title, the ownership section of the commons registers will become increasingly devoid of meaningful data and therefore, in time, defunct. So paragraph 7 makes transitional provision whereby the existing ownership section of the commons registers is kept on life support until it has ceased to have any useful purpose. After that date, the national authority may make regulations to secure the archiving of that information. Until then, we think it is worthwhile for the existing practice to continue, whereby the registration authority removes any entry relating to ownership in its registers upon receiving notice so that the entries do not become positively misleading.
</p>

<a name="51101-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_189"></a>The noble Duke asked about the timescale. The Land Registry will notify a registration of ownership whenever it is aware that the land registered is common land. We would expect it to act promptly. Indeed, the registry has a reputation for acting quickly and in accordance with its targets. The commons registration authority should also act promptly on receipt of the notice, but as the entry in the commons register&#151;unlike the Land Registry&#151;is not conclusive as to ownership, there will not be much harm done or caused even if there is a delay. I hope that deals with the points raised by noble Lords.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_199"></a>We believe that this is very important indeed and we would like a clear statement from the Minister that this will in fact be allowable. We have received a number of representations, in particular one from the Dartmoor Commoners&#039; Council, saying that it feels strongly that after 40 years since the last legislation in which the words &quot;temporary nature&quot; were acknowledged at the time, it is crucial&#151;

<a name="51101-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Would the noble Lord be kind enough to give way for a moment? Is the wording right in this amendment? Is the word really &quot;admission&quot; rather than &quot;omission&quot;? My response depends heavily on which of those two words is correct. Of course I do not want to put the noble Lord on the spot because he is only speaking on behalf of his noble friend Lord Tyler. However, he is speaking to the amendment.

<a name="51101-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Perhaps I may help. This may be an important&#151;if small&#151;issue, but the answer depends very much on which it is. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, obviously cannot be here today, but if he were to let me know which of these it is I would write to him with our reply. He could then determine whether he wanted to take the matter further at Report stage. It might be preferable to having a debate on this issue when we are not absolutely certain what the noble Lord means in his amendment.

<a name="51101-32_spnew9"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Whether it should be &quot;omission&quot; or &quot;admission&quot; in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is an interesting point, but, in any event, Amendment No. 81, standing in the name of my noble friend, refers to opening up the register again in connection with the 1965 Act.
</p>

<a name="51101-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_200"></a>It seems to me that there are two issues here. It is one thing to consider an incorrect registration of the land itself, but it would be a very big mistake to consider reviewing the registration of rights of common land under the 1965 Act. It is 40 years now since that piece <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC46"></a>

of legislation was passed and there is no doubt, in my view&#151;I have witnessed it on many occasions in my capacity as an owner and manager of common land&#151;that considerable mistakes were made. Very large increases in sheep and cattle numbers were registered on common land&#151;unchallenged&#151;and farmers ended up with many more rights than they should have had prior to the 1965 Act. I acknowledge that.
</p>

<a name="51101-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>It is tempting perhaps now to say, &quot;Can we go back and try to resolve those issues?&quot; But we cannot. Farming systems have evolved since then; farmers have established grazing regimes on commons; and a system of management is now in place. To go back would be ludicrous, quite frankly and counter productive. We must go forward&#151;and the way forward, surely, is through, where necessary, commons associations dealing with this particular problem. In cases where there is considerable over-grazing on sites of special scientific interest, then English Nature or, in the case of Wales, CCW, have the powers to engage the farmers in agri-environment schemes to reduce that grazing, and the same will apply in the future.
</p>

<a name="51101-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>I briefly add my intervention to the debate in order to say, &quot;Let us go forward&quot;. Let us not go back because, quite frankly, it would be totally impractical to do so.

</p>

<a name="51101-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to make it a duty of the commons registration authority to correct errors in the register as set out in the clause, rather than allowing it to do so when it feels like getting round to it.

</p>

<a name="51101-32_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>These are all technical and factual matters and it seems ridiculous that, if and when the commons registration authority discovers such mistakes, it should not have a duty to put the register right, rather than simply being able to do it or not do it, as the case may be. There really should be a duty to change an entry, not merely a power to do so. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to that.
</p>

<a name="51101-32_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>I was particularly interested in Amendment No. 82, which was spoken to by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, which seeks to delete subsection (5). I have read the subsection several times and it seems to be the sort of vague waffly law that might be good for the lawyers who will be employed to decide what it means, but it is really quite extraordinary. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_37"></a>&quot;A mistake in a register may not be corrected under this section if the authority considers that, by reason of reliance reasonably placed on the register&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-32_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>it is probably OK up to that point&#151;

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-32_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>perhaps the Minister can give examples of what this might involve&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_39"></a>&quot;it would in all the circumstances be unfair to do so&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51101-32_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>I could understand it if people had suffered loss or harm as a result, but &quot;unfair&quot; does not seem to be the kind of word that belongs in legislation. It is certainly the kind of word that belongs in political discourse, but what does it mean? The words,

<p><a name="gc_st_115"></a>
<a name="51101-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We move to Clause 18. Amendments Nos. 79 and 80, which were moved or spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, would require the commons registration authority to seek the agreement of a statutory commons association and to consult with the public in exercising its powers to correct mistakes in the commons register. I hope that I can assure the noble Lord that his amendments go only a little further than we already intend to go in regulations.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>Clause 23 applies to applications and proposals for amendments to registers under Clause 18, as they apply to all applications under Part 1. Those powers enable us to make regulations for the purposes of making and determining applications and we fully intend that in the context of corrections to the registers under Clause 23 there will be public notification of what is proposed and an opportunity for objections to be made and heard.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>I can go further: where a commons association has been established under Part 2 in relation to a common, regulations will certainly require notification of the association about any proposal to exercise powers under Clause 18, although we think it would be going <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a little too far to give the association a power of veto, as the noble Lord&#039;s amendment seems to imply. The determination of an application under Clause 18 must be a matter for the authority rather than the association.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>Amendment No. 79A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would impose a duty on the commons registration authority to amend the register for the purpose of correcting errors. To an extent, we believe that that is already the effect of Clause 18. Where a registration authority receives an application for amendment of the register under Clause 18, it will be obliged to determine that application. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would perhaps prefer that the authority was also under a duty or obligation to seek out mistakes in the register and initiate proposals to amend those mistakes under subsection (4).
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>We believe that registration authorities are very likely to deal with mistakes where they are aware of problems particularly affecting their own interests. In many registration authorities, experienced commons registration officers will have accumulated a long list of defects in the registers, awaiting new powers of rectification. Authorities may wish to deal with many of the entries on those lists of their own volition. Equally, many mistakes on the register will affect private interests. For example, the landowner may well wish to pursue the opportunity under the legislation to remove duplicate rights from the register, and the commoner may wish to correct an error in the description of his dominant tenement. In such cases, it would be quite wrong to impose an obligation on the authority to initiate an amendment regardless, not least because it would relieve the applicant of any obligation to pay any fee consequent upon his application.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_221"></a>I remind the noble Lord that authorities will be under an obligation during the transitional period to review the registers under the provisions of Schedule 2, and to capture outstanding events which have not been registered since 1970. We have taken powers to prescribe what must be done during the transitional period. We shall come to Schedule 2 in due course.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>There will also be an opportunity for authorities to identify errors in the registers if they convert to electronic registers under Clause 24. They will then wish to use their powers under Clause 18 to make the necessary amendments.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>We think that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment goes a little too far. Indeed, taken literally, it would require the authority to search out and correct every last minor flaw in the register, at quite considerable cost. The Bill already contains provisions to ensure that the more important errors which are amenable to correction under Clause 18 are likely to be identified and resolved.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>Perhaps I may deal with Amendments Nos. 81 and 82, in the name of the noble Duke; I know that they are probing amendments. Amendment No. 81 would clarify the powers to correct mistakes made by the registration authority in making or amending an entry in the register. It would make it clear that those powers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC49"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were available, whether the entry had been made in the past or would be made in the future. That is precisely the effect of Clause 18(2)(a) in its present form. Paragraph (a) does not specifically refer to entries already made; therefore, the power will apply equally whether the mistake has been made in the past or will be made in the future.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>Amendment No. 82 deals with the test of fairness which a registration authority must undertake in relation to an application to correct the register. The amendment would remove the requirement to conduct the fairness test.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>On the face of it, it seems entirely reasonable that if there is an error in the register that qualifies for correction under Clause 18, that correction should be made; after all, that is simply a matter of putting right what is wrong. But some errors will be of long standing and have given rise to expectations which in the real world should not lightly be set aside. For example, the commons registration authority may have mistakenly excluded land from the register in 1968 by inaccurately copying an application for registration. That land may have been subsequently acquired by a person reliant on an inspection of the register, which of course showed it not to be registered common land at all. Subsection (5) provides, in effect, that the authority would not be able to correct the mistake if it would, in all the circumstances, be unfair to do so, having regard, for example, to the interests of the person who had acquired the land, as well as the interests of others interested in correcting the error.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_227"></a>I break off from my brief to reply to a question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the expression &quot;unfair&quot; in legislation. I have no evidence to back it up at the moment, but it is my belief that the word appears on many occasions in legislation. It is for the courts to interpret what it means in any given circumstances, but there is nothing unusual about the word &quot;unfair&quot; being in legislation. If I am wrong about that, I know that the noble Lord will come back to me in due course.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>We believe that it would be too mechanical and too simplistic to provide that every eligible error must be corrected, come what may. Sometimes the circumstances will demand that sleeping dogs are best left to lie. The registration authority is tasked with carrying out that assessment, which is not always easy, and must be able to exercise its own judgment, as long as it is reasonable, in arriving at a determination. To do otherwise would be to risk some very hard cases indeed.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_229"></a>When the noble Earl, Lord Peel, tells us that it would be a mistake to allow correction of excessive registrations or mistaken registrations of rights under the 1965 Act, we agree with him. We have listened to the views of many stakeholders, and recognise that many rights registered in the 1960s were inflated and excessive and sometimes when taken together out of all proportion to the capacity of the common to sustain such numbers. But we believe, in common with most interested parties, that we have to move on now, and that reopening those registrations 45 years later will <br>&nbsp;<br>

not be helpful in achieving better management of our commons. I know that we can be criticised for taking that particular attitude, but we believe that it is living in the real world. We want to look to the future rather than constantly going back to mistakes that may have been made 40 years ago. I hope that I have gone some way to persuade the noble Lord that the Government are right on this.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_116"></a>
<a name="51101-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   In responding to the debate, particularly to the last point that the Minister made, I largely agree that it is impossible to right many of the wrongs that were made as the result of the 1965 Act; in fact, that is one of the reasons why we have a new Bill before us now. One or two cases of serious injustices occurred, and the Minister will find that the next amendment to be debated, Amendment No. 81B, recognises something in particular on a point of law. So I shall leave that matter until then.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>The Minister should not underestimate the feeling among a small number of commoners who feel that they have been severely wronged as a result of what has happened in the past. Indeed, in some instances, they have been ignorant of the situation. He will probably get some continuing representations about this, but there is a clause for correction in the Bill, which is important. In one sense we have to move on, but some of the issues will probably linger a little. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

It is an interesting and specific case, though I suspect it may not be the only one. Amendment No. 81B, which has been carefully drafted, states:

<p><a name="gc_stpa_233"></a> There is an anomaly, and I regret to have to bring this to the attention to the Committee, in terms of Crown land. A situation has been brought to my attention. The Crown land concerned is a large tract of land with mineral rights on some of it. Common rights were registered as a result of the 1965 Act, but there was a muddle. As I understand it, the Crown land had some of its own grazing rights, but other Crown land was also classified where the dominant holdings had grazing rights on other Crown land. The grazers thought they could not register the grazing rights themselves at that time. In hindsight, which is always easy, they now realise they could have done so.

<a name="51101-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_234"></a>In law, there is no question that these rights are proved by being recorded on the title deeds of the property. There are other instances of this occurring. It is particularly unjust that some common-right holders have, as a result of their non-registration of their grazing rights, subsequently been treated as tenants of the Crown, and have been required to pay rent annually even though the rights are registered on their title deeds. This has amounted in some cases to thousands of pounds per annum over the last &quot;x&quot; number of years since this occurred in the late 1960s. We feel that this situation could be resolved amicably and without recrimination, possibly by the deed right holders bringing forward a bond that could be redeemed, as an indication of their commitment to getting some form of justice in this respect.
</p>

<a name="51101-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_235"></a>I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to this situation because it has been drawn to mine, and I was unaware of it. It would be good to think it could be resolved. After all, these people have those grazing rights in the title of their dominant holding. I beg to move.

<a name="51101-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   If I have understood the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, correctly, he intends that Amendment No. 81B would enable the revival of certain rights of common which were held before 1967 but which were not registered during the initial wave of registrations under the Commons Registration Act 1965. The noble Lord cited a particular case involving Crown land. I am sure he will not be surprised if I say that I am not going to be able to comment on the circumstances of an individual case. I offer to consider further the points he seeks to raise using that case as an illustration, but I cannot offer to do anything to resolve the particular case. Even if I were to do so, it would not be helpful since I am not a lawyer.
</p>

<a name="51101-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>The position on rights which existed before 1967 but which were unregistered for any reason is that those rights were extinguished from 31 July 1970. Some organisations representing commoners have asked for provision to enable some such rights to be revived by means of registration under the Bill. However, we think that it is really too late to attempt to resuscitate the body of rights which was extinguished some 35 years ago. We have said that in the context of inflated rights registered under the 1965 Act, and I will repeat it in the context of rights lost under that same Act, 35 years is a long time and I do not think it would be right to create a new opportunity to try to claim those rights now.

We are not asking for retrospection or reimbursement of those moneys, but what the noble Baroness has said is that they will continue to pay rent because of their ignorance of certain specific points of law. I am sure that 35 years ago when people saw the word &quot;Crown&quot; used in the context of the ownership of common land and couched in the kind of language that these people would not normally use&#151;

<p><a name="gc_st_124"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 83 I shall speak to Amendment No. 83A, which is linked closely to Amendment No. 84 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. I shall wait to hear what the noble Lord has to say before I make any comment on his amendment.
</p>

<a name="51101-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_240"></a>As I indicated earlier, taking a case to the High Court is extremely expensive. Our amendment would allow a person to make an application to a county court if he or she felt that there was adequate proof to demonstrate that an entry made in the register was the result of fraud.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_125"></a>
<a name="51101-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to my Amendment No. 84. My noble friend has been reluctant to define what is fair and unfair, but we have a considerable problem in that the High Court, the county court or whichever court it is, can order a commons registration authority to amend the register if that is considered to be fair. Let us suppose that Powys County Council, which is the registration authority in my part of Wales, says &quot;We don&#039;t like this, it&#039;s not very good&quot;, and someone goes to the High Court or the county court which says that, on balance, it is unfair&#151;or fair&#151;that a register should be changed. Let us also suppose that the National Assembly states in general guidance under the register that it should be possible for this or that to happen. Where do we sit on this? Leaving aside my general question, we need at least some words from the Minister regarding what might or might not be fair.

<p><a name="gc_st_126"></a>

<a name="column_GC53"></a>

court should have a role in such matters. Traditionally, they have not&#151;they have been matters of Chancery, dealt with by the High Court&#151;but I am sufficiently persuaded to look at this again to see whether there might be a role for the county court. She should not necessarily expect that we would come back with the answer she seeks, but I can see the strength of the case that she made, particularly in relation to costs. However, noble Lords should not think that county court actions are necessarily cheap.
</p>

<a name="51101-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_241"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 84, I understand exactly what my noble friend meant when he stated that where fraud is proven it should be put right. The argument that I shall put forward is not an easy one, but I ask the Committee to listen to it with patience. It is not a long argument but I think I have already hinted at it. We must remember that many entries in the commons registers date back some 40 years. I am not naive about the fact that some of the claims for the provisional registration of rights were exaggerated, dishonest and even downright fraudulent.
</p>

<a name="51101-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_242"></a>But, frankly, proving fraud many years later is unlikely to be practical. Indeed, so far as we are aware, few, if any, such claims have been brought before the High Court by virtue of similar provision in Section 14 of the Commons Registration Act 1965. Nevertheless, we do believe that if fraud can be proven, there might be good reasons why it may not be fair or reasonable to put right what was wrong. For example, fraud may have been perpetrated to secure an unwarranted registration of rights in the register, but those rights attached to a farm holding that were fraudulently gained may have passed between several innocent successors in title to that farm, each of whom paid a realistic price to reflect the value of the rights. Section 10 of the 1965 Act ensured that registration was conclusive evidence of the existence of those rights and the purchasers would have had no reason at all to doubt the provenance of their rights.
</p>

<a name="51101-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_243"></a>So we think that the court should have discretion&#151;that is all we are saying&#151;to decline to order an amendment to the register, even where fraud has been proven. But I can go this far&#151;and hope that that is sufficient for him today&#151;and agree to reflect further on the meaning of &quot;fair&quot; as used in the clause and to write to him and consider whether an amendment is needed.

Yes, a fraud is a fraud and, wherever it came from, sooner or later, the court is entitled to say that a fraud is a fraud. Nevertheless, I accept that, as my noble friend has explained, there may be circumstances where those rights have been transferred from generation to generation and the court must have some discretion. I just do not like the word &quot;fair&quot;, to be perfectly honest.

<p><a name="gc_st_132"></a>
<a name="51101-35_spnew0"></a><b>  Lord Bach: </b>   The new clause is unnecessary. Local authorities retain the existing powers under Clause 43 to protect unclaimed commons from unlawful interference and take proceedings in respect of any offences committed in respect of the land. The real problem concerning unclaimed land is not that there is no known owner but that the lack of clarity about ownership can give rise to ineffective management. We have therefore concluded that the problem can best be tackled by enhancing the powers for management of unclaimed land and, in addition to Clause 43, giving commons associations established under Part 2 the power to manage unclaimed commons. That will achieve the underlying objective: that unclaimed commons are managed more effectively where improved management is called for.
</p>

<a name="51101-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_247"></a>Amendments that I have already tabled to Part 2, which I fear we shall not reach today, will serve precisely those purposes. The amendments do two things. They broaden the range of land management functions that may be conferred on a commons association. Secondly, they dispense with the need for the owner&#039;s explicit consent to management activities where the owner cannot be found. So commons associations will be able to manage common land, even where the owner cannot be identified, and so ensure that our ultimate objective of better management can be achieved.
</p>

<a name="51101-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_248"></a>It follows that the purpose of Amendment No. 85 will be achieved in part by the amendments, including Amendment No. 182A, which I have tabled to Part 2. I look forward to the noble Lord&#039;s keen support for those amendments. Turning to what remains of Amendment No. 85, which is intended to enable local authorities to manage unclaimed common land, we again think that the task is best undertaken by a commons association where there is a need for management of agricultural activity that cannot be achieved at present. Local authorities already have powers to make schemes for the regulation and management of common land under Part 1 of the Commons Act 1899, provided that the scheme is not opposed by more than one-third of those with rights of common.


</p>

<a name="51101-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_249"></a>The scheme would give the local authority extensive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

powers to manage the common in the best interests of the community. A proviso to Section 2(4) of the 1899 Act provides that owners of common land may object to the making of a scheme, but when there is no known owner, it follows that no such objection is likely to be received. These powers are already at the disposal of local authorities, and we would commend the making of such a scheme to an authority that wishes to manage a lowland common but feels that it lacks the necessary powers.
</p>

<a name="51101-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_250"></a>Our view is, therefore, that this Bill and existing legislation make sufficient provision to enable the effective management of unclaimed common land, and that the amendment, although we understand why it is moved, is not needed.

<a name="51101-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_253"></a>The noble Duke said: We are dealing here with the question of inspection. The Data Protection Act 1998 was passed to enable private matters to remain private. It was passed at a time when many people and the popular press were greatly annoyed by the way in which information that should be confidential and remain so was being used by companies and authorities in a way that was of no benefit to the persons to whom the information related. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 relates to information held by officialdom in the course of its duty. It does not and should not remove the requirement of the said officialdom to observe the rules of data protection. The right of public inspection of registers should be confined to the registers and the documents referred to in them. It should not extend to other documents that were supplied before the authority was in a position to warn the owner of such documents that they would be open to public inspection. Even if some of the data in these documents may be available in another context, we do not feel that they should be handed over if the owner was not aware that that might happen at some time in future. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_135"></a>
<a name="51101-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   This amendment would restrict the right conferred in Clause 19(1)(c) to inspect papers relating to applications for registration. In opposition to what the noble Duke said, we believe that such papers should be made available to the public, because they will be essential to determining the outcome of many applications facilitated by Part 1 of the Bill. For example, a successful application for correction of the register may depend on showing that an error was made in transcribing an application for registration <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

under the 1965 Act. How might an applicant demonstrate that fact if he is denied access to the relevant papers? We recognise that many authorities already make such papers available to the public on request, but practice is not consistent, and this clause will put the matter beyond doubt.
</p>

<a name="51101-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_254"></a>Clause 19 will in general require the disclosure of all relevant information, but regulations made under subsection (2) may nevertheless require matters to be withheld from public inspection when disclosure would be unreasonable. For example, it may be reasonable to withhold personal data that relate to applications made in the recent past, and we expect to consult in order to identify whether there should be exclusions before commencing Clause 19 generally. The amendment would achieve precisely the opposite of what we believe is the right thing to do&#151;that is, full disclosure of historical records, which are essential to applications for amendment of the register under this new legislation, but controlled access to more contemporary data. I hope that this goes some way to persuading the noble Duke that the amendment should be withdrawn.

The advent of photocopiers may well have reduced the number of errors, although I cannot say that it has reduced all errors. The other night I went to my club at a late hour and asked what room I was in. I was told that it was room 12. When it was looked into a little further, the room number was in fact supposed to be 42 but the photocopier had missed out part of the &quot;4&quot;.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_261"></a>Amendment No. 88 deals with a rather obscure provision. From what the noble Duke said, we are assuming that it is intended to exclude the liability of a person who relies on a copy containing a mistake that appears in the original register. As an aside, I am not sure whether the press would accept someone being in the wrong room at night as being a fault of the photocopier. In other words, under this amendment the copy would be perfectly correct but the register would be faulty, as opposed to the copier being faulty. However, the register is generally conclusive of the matters registered&#151;warts and all. So a person who relies on a &quot;mistake&quot; in that register would be acting entirely properly and could not be held liable for his actions.

Commons Registration Act 1965. The CROW Act does so in relation to the registration of rights of way, and has allowed researchers and local authorities until 1 January 2026. But the paths to which it relates go back in time to before 1949. In the circumstances, 10 years for correcting errors made as a result of the application of the 1965 Act seems adequate and in keeping with the other legislation. The actual date is designed to maintain a unity of approach across the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_268"></a>On Amendments Nos. 91, 97, 102 and 109, and in an amendment to Clause 21, it has been suggested that all applications relating to attempts to register land under the 1965 Act should have been completed by 28 June 2015. It is not possible even to guess at the number of such attempts that have been made since 1965. It is obviously not possible to estimate how many of those that were will be subject to a registration application now. Nor is it feasible to predict the pattern of such application across the country. Presumably, some counties will have many more than others, and some may have none at all.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_269"></a>All these applications will have to be dealt with. There may be disagreements and disputes but the commons registration authority has to be satisfied that the grounds for an application are correct. The process may take days, or even months. The authorities must have a date beyond which no further applications are allowed.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_270"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 109 would also insert the date 28 June 2012. A transitional provision should be less than allowed for completion, so we are suggesting seven years from 28 June 2005. Hence, the operative date for severance qualification would be 28 June 2005. Exactly seven years later, we would see the end of the transitional period for rectification of mistakes under the 1965 Act, and exactly three years after that, the whole process would come to an end. The exact dates are not in fact as important as the principle that all processes of change should have deadlines. This is not quite the same as &quot;targets&quot;, because deadlines do not allow for slippage. Either they are met or they are missed. If it is the latter, then it is too late.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_271"></a>In Amendment No. 112 to Schedule 2, we have suggested an amendment to Clause 22 that the transitional period should last to 28 June 2012. Defra has reportedly indicated to interested parties that it would like this period to last only three years. Apparently, however, it subsequently also indicated that this timetable might vary across the country from area to area. Clause 53(1) would give the power to commence the transition period at different times in different areas. Does the Minister&#039;s department have any solid basis for this? Has it, for instance, compiled figures showing the number of qualifying events which were not registered under the 1965 Act?
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_272"></a>Does the department have any indication of how these are distributed across the country? Are they mainly rural, mainly urban or a fairly even mix?

retrospective registration of greens might cause? The RSPB is concerned lest this process is either so pressurised that errors are made and those holding rights of common are not given every opportunity to register their interest in the land, or so relaxed that nothing is done for years. They wish to see commons registration authorities supported in working towards the attainment of the PSA target for SSSI-favourable condition by 2010, thereby also facilitating entry by commoners into agri-environment schemes. They point out that until things are sorted out, SSSIs on affected common land are likely to continue to degrade. I beg to move.

<a name="51101-36_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 113 standing in my name, and to that of my noble friend Lord Livsey, which address many similar points to those raised by the noble Duke. Both the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, and the noble Lord, Lord Bach, have spoken this evening of the need to draw a line, when they were speaking in reply to my noble friend Lord Livsey. Unless we specify a time limit, particularly with regard to Schedule 2, the Government are probably failing to draw a line again in the way that they need to. Everyone needs a definite result from this, and to have some certainty. Drawing a specific time limit will focus everyone&#039;s minds and give that certainty after that date that this matter will be resolved by then.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_143"></a>
<a name="51101-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Amendment No. 89 would require the correction of mistakes in the register under the provisions of Schedule 1 to be concluded by 28 June 2015. Amendments Nos. 91, 97, 99 and 102 would therefore remove the power in Schedule 1 to specify a cut-off date for application and regulations. The Committee knows by now that the registers drawn up under the 1965 Act contain many inaccuracies. Where these inaccuracies relate to the extent of registered common land or greens&#151;that is, to the boundaries of registered land&#151;provision is made in Schedule 1 for corrections to be made in limited circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_273"></a>Regulations will be able to prescribe a cut-off date for applications under Schedule 1. After that date has passed we believe that registers should become final and conclusive of such matters, right or wrong. We expect to consult on fixing a cut-off date, but our present view is that in setting the date we should not repeat the difficulties that were met after the passing of the 1965 Act in rushing the application process and denying adequate opportunities for consultation and publicity. We have in mind a substantial period of time, maybe 10 years or even considerably longer.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_274"></a>We are also considering whether it would be sensible to roll out the implementation of the Bill on a phased basis, commencing with a pilot in a particular county or region. That would enable us to refine regulations, guidance and practice in the light of experience. We do not want to make the same mistakes that were made after 1965. I feel sure the National Assembly will also wish to retain discretion in terms of the timetable for implementation in Wales.

<a name="51101-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_275"></a>Noble Lords will know of the Common Land (Rectification of Registers) Act 1989, which provided a time-limited opportunity to remove wrongly-registered houses and gardens from the registers and expired three years later. Yet many homeowners who could have applied under the Act were simply unaware of their opportunity to do so. So we believe that it would be best to avoid arbitrary cut-off dates and to maintain the flexibility afforded by the regulation-making powers in Schedule 1.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_276"></a>The noble Duke asked about the number of qualifying events, but we cannot say how many events are outstanding, precisely because they have not been brought forward for registration. We expect the number of events to be significantly higher in areas where commoning remains important because of transfers of rights. We expect that progress can be made in establishing commons associations under Part 2, without waiting for full reform under Part 1. So the achievements of the PSA target need not be affected by the potential programme for rolling out Part 1.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_277"></a>Amendment No. 109 would require the transitional period for bringing the registers up to date in Schedule 2 to be concluded by 28 June 2012. Amendment No. 112 would consequentially remove the power to make regulations prescribing the duration of the transitional period. Amendment No. 113, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would have a similar effect to Amendment No. 109: it would require the transitional period to be concluded by no later than 10 years from the date of commencement of the Act. We believe that a period of only six years, or even 10 years, from Royal Assent to enable the updating of the registers throughout England and Wales is perhaps too ambitious.
</p>

<a name="51101-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_278"></a>We already know that it is going to be a big job, but as I have said, we are considering a phased implementation of Part 1 of the Bill. That means that it would be inappropriate to impose a fixed cut-off date in relation to the conclusion of the transitional period. Moreover, we wish to learn from experience in deciding how long we should allow for the transitional period in any particular area. Our view is that three years is about right, but we are more than willing to listen to advice and to learn from experience, and we may find that three years is quite insufficient. Our argument is that we should not impose rigid timetables in the Bill but should retain the flexibility to adapt as our understanding of the requirements of implementation improves.

<a name="51101-37_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I am very interested to hear what the Minister has to say. He is leaving an awful lot up to regulations in future. Given that he has already developed in his mind the pattern that things are likely to take, it might be more interesting to see how long the Government believe they would require for a roll-out period; perhaps a time limit should be proposed after the end of the roll-out period, during which the general registration should take place. In the mean time, we had better read what the Minister said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51101-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach </b>   moved Amendment No. 90:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_49"></a>Page 29, line 9, leave out &quot;waste land of a manor&quot; and insert &quot;land&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_146"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments are intended to make two significant alterations to the criteria for applications under Schedule 1. In this group is Amendment No. 103A, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Peel; we are minded to take it away and consider it. I tell him that before I move my amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_147"></a>
<a name="51101-37_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am extremely grateful to the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_148"></a>
<a name="51101-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   There is certainly no answer to that. First, our amendments will amend provision for the registration of waste land of the manor under paragraph 2 so that the test of whether the land is truly waste land is applied at the date of application, and not at the date on which the application is determined. Perhaps I should note here, if the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will forgive me, that the effect of his Amendment No. 93, is that the test would be brought earlier in time to what I take to be the date of Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_282"></a>Secondly, our amendments would clarify the circumstances in which application may be made for deregistration of wrongly registered common land or town or village green. We see the amendments to paragraph 2 as helpful in ensuring that, when an application has been made for the registration of land, the tribunal will have to consider whether the land was waste land of the manor at the date of the application. So it will do the landowner no good if he seeks to do something to the land when the application has been put in, such as enclosing or cultivating it, because that can have no effect on the outcome of the application. That seems to us an entirely sensible precaution against pre-emptive strikes.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_283"></a>The second raft of amendments will ensure that applications for deregistration of wrongly registered common land and greens can be made, even when there was a referral under the Commons Registration Act 1965 of the original registration to the commons commissioners regarding the ownership of the land. It was not our intention to rule out applications in such cases, but it has been suggested that that is one possible interpretation of the wording in paragraphs 4(2)(c) and 5(2)(c) of Schedule 1.


</p>

<a name="51101-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_284"></a>The amendments will clarify that such a referral must have taken place under Section 5 of the 1965 Act&#151;meaning that there was an objection to the registration of the land or rights of common&#151;rather than a referral to determine ownership under Section 8. We are happy to put that beyond doubt, although unfortunately it seems that it demands rather a large number of amendments to the schedule. I beg to move.

<a name="51101-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   Two amendments in this group are in my name&#151;Amendments Nos. 93 and 93A. In terms of the debate and the arguments to be deployed, Amendment No. 93A should not be in this group. In fact, having given the amendment further consideration, I think that, even by my standards, it is flying a rather ambitious kite. Therefore, I do not intend to press Amendment No. 93A.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_285"></a>As is the case with a number of the amendments that I have tabled, the purpose of Amendment No. 93 is to make the provisions of the Bill less restrictive for people who might want to apply for registration of commons and so on.

&quot;(   )   In the case of any land which was common land at any time in the previous 150 years, the landowner with title absolute may register the land as common land with the commons registration authority.&quot;

<p><a name="gc_st_155"></a>The noble Lord said: The effect of Amendment No. 91A would be to allow the owner of a piece of land which used to be common to reregister it as such. He may be registering it anew if it was common land before 1965 or it may be a matter of reregistering it. The period of 150 years in the amendment is purely arbitrary. It is merely an attempt to refer to land which ceased to be common fairly recently in terms of the history of commons and not to make the provision apply to land which may have been common land about 1,000 years ago.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_288"></a>Previously we discussed the fact that the Bill as it stands allows owners of land to declare land as common under an express grant with the appropriate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legal documents, such as deeds. That would make it a simple process of allowing the owner of land which was common fairly recently to return it to being common land. That is the purpose of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_289"></a>I am putting this forward having had some examples brought to my attention by the Friends of the Lake District, who believe that there are instances where this would be helpful and valuable, certainly in that part of the country. They quote the example of former commons around the Thirlmere reservoir. The Corporation of Manchester took over the land, converted it from commons to their ownership and planted conifer forests on it. Given the way people consider managing such land nowadays, as opposed to when the reservoir was built, a public body like that might well decide that it is no longer necessary to have conifer forests there and that it would be sensible to return it to its original state as common land. It has been suggested to me that the mere ability of such an organisation to register land would be the sensible way forward.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_290"></a>The second example is of a common where it is fairly clear from the layout of the walls, the land and the arrangement of the common that it used to be larger, and part of it&#151;for whatever reason, perhaps by agreement with local people&#151;was not registered as common land under the 1965 Act, while the rest of it was. So perhaps the common has a wall around it, while part of it was fenced off and not registered as common land, although the history of it suggests that it should have been. I do not want to reopen the question of errors in the 1965 Act&#039;s registrations, but I suggest that if the commoners of the existing common were to purchase the piece of land they believe should be part of the common, they would then be the landowners. A simple process of registering the rest of that former common as part of the common that now exists ought to be possible. That is a straightforward situation and a straightforward process, and that is the purpose of this amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_156"></a>
<a name="51101-37_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Happily, I think I can reassure the noble Lord that his amendment is not necessary. It is already possible for the owner of land to cause it to become common land, and it will continue to be possible under this Bill. In common law, if a right of common is granted or acquired over land, that land becomes common land. Nothing more is required. Under this Bill, if a person wishes to turn land in his freehold ownership into common land, he will be able to grant a right of common to any person under Clause 6. The grant must be attached to a new dominant tenement, and the land must be able to sustain that new right. That is the effect of Clause 6(5) as amended by Amendment No. 13, which we discussed last Tuesday.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_291"></a>It would not be possible for the noble Lord to create a right in favour of his neighbour&#039;s home to graze a thousand cattle over the noble Lord&#039;s back garden because, unless it is a very large garden indeed, those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column GC64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cattle could not be sustained on that land. If, however, he were to create a right to collect fallen wood in favour of his neighbour&#039;s home, that would seem perfectly proper. Clause 6(4)(b), as amended, would require the noble Lord&#039;s back garden to become registered as common land as a direct consequence of the grant.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_292"></a>I hope that what I have described would achieve the desired result, and that the noble Lord will agree that his amendment is not necessary. He made a point about this being simpler under Amendment No. 91A than by express grant. It is not possible to make the process of express grant much simpler. We have had this debate before. I already expect that formal grant will be prescribed under Clause 6, so it is only a matter of form-filling to get an express grant in this case.
</p>

<a name="51101-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_293"></a>Before I sit down, I intend to consider with care the next group of amendments to which the noble Lord will speak. That is also true for Amendment No. 106 in the name of the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The review will be led by Professor Dimmock and the membership will be drawn from independent experts in a range of fields including virology, logistics, veterinary science and animal behaviour. The review team will examine the current arrangements for the quarantine of captive birds; they will be able to talk to practitioners and experts in the field as well as examining existing guidance and procedures. They may also want to visit quarantine premises.

<a name="51101-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>Debby Reynolds, the Chief Vet, and I have asked Professor Dimmock to report his findings as speedily as possible. We hope to receive his report, which we will publish, within around one month.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>I am most grateful to Professor Dimmock for taking on this important task. The advice of his expert review team will enable us to ensure that our avian quarantine arrangements are as up to date and effective as they can be in the face of the significant challenges we face from the rapid worldwide spread of highly pathogenic zoonotic disease.

The report, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House, made wide-ranging recommendations for both regulatory and non-regulatory solutions to problems identified with the care homes market. These have been broadly accepted by government, devolved administrations and regulators. The Government&#039;s action plan, which relates to England, has been placed in the Libraries of the House. Responsibility for care services is devolved in other areas of the UK.

</p>

<a name="51101-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The United Kingdom presidency hosted an informal meeting of Health Ministers of the European Union on 20 and 21 October chaired by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The main areas of discussion were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>pandemic flu preparedness;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>values and common principles in healthcare systems; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>EU patient mobility.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51101-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>EU Health Ministers held an important discussion on pandemic flu preparedness. They dealt with three issues:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>avian flu, where the World Health Organisation stressed that the risk in Europe is very low for the general population;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>seasonal flu, which we are dealing with in the usual way; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>the risk of pandemic flu.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51101-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>The WHO confirmed that there had been no increase in the level of risk for pandemic flu, but of course we need to ensure that we are properly prepared in each of our own countries.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Ministers agreed to do more to co-ordinate our efforts at European level, and continue to work closely with the WHO, recognising that no country can solve these problems on its own. Commissioner Kyprianou also outlined plans for a preparedness exercise, &quot;Common Ground&quot;, next month which will be a simulation exercise focusing on communication between key players in the event of a pandemic flu outbreak.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>On values and common principles in healthcare systems, Ministers discussed that although there is much diversity, there is much that unites the systems in terms of their underpinning values and common principles. Ministers agreed that there was a need to address the challenges that health systems face in terms <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS11"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column WS11</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of ageing society and rising costs, while maintaining these common values and principles. Ministers expressed interest in developing a statement on values and common principles. It also represented an excellent example of the EU delivering social justice in a globalised world, a theme that the heads of government would discuss at their informal meeting at the end of October.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>On EU patient mobility, Ministers noted the co-operation that has existed for decades between our health systems, ensuring that workers, tourists and people who have retired to other member states can get access to care should they fall ill. However, there was also a need to clarify the rights and entitlements that patients should expect when they seek treatment in another EU member state. The choice that patients have was an important right but it must be managed in a structured way, taking account of the differences between national healthcare systems, so that both patients and member states are clear about entitlement.
</p>

<a name="51101-38_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>Ministers considered that work in these areas could be looked at by the public health working group at a senior level, with the idea of a report back to council at a future Health Council.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="51101-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Caroline Flint) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on 28 October.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the European Union met on 24&#150;25 October and voted on a proposal to authorise food ingredients derived from the genetically modified maize line MON863. As the vote did not result in the necessary majority either for or against the proposal, the regulatory committee procedure for implementing powers requires that the proposal is passed back to the European Commission to adopt the implementing act.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The Government regret that it was necessary to vote on this authorisation, through a scrutiny override, before parliamentary scrutiny has been completed and before the debate recommended by the European Scrutiny Committee. The United Kingdom had previously supported this authorisation because there was adequate evidence that the necessary criteria for authorisation&#151;namely; safety, consumer information and nutritional quality&#151;had been met. In the absence of a clear majority among member states at that stage, the decision was later referred to the council with a deadline of three months for a further vote. It is unfortunate that this period coincided with the Summer Recess and it was therefore not possible to complete the scrutiny process before the vote. I wrote to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee on 20 October setting out this position. The Government are, none the less, fully committed to the need for national Parliaments to have proper oversight <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51101-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The Canadian Minister of Health, Ujjal Dosanjh, convened an international meeting of Ministers of Health in Ottawa on 24&#150;25 October to discuss global pandemic influenza readiness. I attended for the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>There were Health Ministers and delegates from 30 countries covering all parts of the world.

</p>

<a name="51101-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>There was participation at the highest level from a number of UN and other international agencies dealing with various sectoral aspects of preparing for pandemic flu, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), World Bank, and the recently appointed UN co-ordinator for pandemic influenza. The European Commission was also represented.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The purpose of the meeting was to raise the political priority attached to international collaboration in preparing for a human influenza pandemic, to stress the need for transparency between countries and institutions, and to give full support to the leading role of multilateral institutions.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Four themes were discussed:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>the need for inter-sectoral collaboration on animal and human health issues;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>improving surveillance and capacity-building;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>vaccine and anti-viral development, supply and access; and

</p>
</ul>
<a name="51101-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>A communique was agreed. A copy has been placed in the Library. It sets out in more detail the priority areas agreed on for further action, and lists some key current and forthcoming activities round the world. A list of all participating Ministers is attached to the communique.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The main conclusions were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>there is a need to distinguish between avian flu (birds), seasonal flu and pandemic flu;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>a call for increased research on avian influenza viruses, including their ability to spread from animals to humans;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>there is a need to increase capacity for early detection, diagnosis and response, and for exchange of information between the agriculture and health sectors at the local, national and international levels;
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS13"></a>

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column WS13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>
</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_15"></a>the need for expansion and integration of the network of relevant WHO collaborating centres and FAO-OIE reference laboratories, for the rapid identification of virus strains;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_16"></a>the need to develop bio-security guidelines for the poultry sector to help farming communities ensure appropriate animal and public health standards for the raising, handling and transporting of potentially flu-bearing animals; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_17"></a>the need to develop effective partnerships with media and other key stakeholders for the exchange and dissemination of information.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51101-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Ministers recognised the need to build capacity and plan in all countries, facilitated by appropriate national and international investments and resource sharing. But all stressed the need to work through and with multilateral organisations. In particular, they welcomed the upcoming WHO/FAO/World Bank meeting on avian and pandemic influenza in Geneva from 7&#150;9 November, where many of the issues they managed to highlight in a relatively short meeting will be looked at further.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The meeting was successful in raising political awareness and commitment across all WHO regions of the need both for avian influenza control measures as well as the need to strengthen preparedness for pandemic influenza in humans.
</p>

<a name="51101-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>Ministers noted a number of activities already ongoing or planned in regions around the world, and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="51101w01_wqn0"></a><b> The Countess of Mar </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What measures are in place for the reporting and    investigating of incidents of exposure to contaminated air in United Kingdom aircraft; how many reports have been received for each year since 1995; how many of these reports were investigated; and what conclusions were drawn.  [HL1637]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="51101w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s mandatory occurrence reporting scheme requires reports of contaminated air events where they are considered by the reporter to represent potential airworthiness concerns. To identify the serious events from these, CAA review all smoke and fume events that may be related to engine oil and categorise them by the severity of the reported symptoms, as experienced by the pilots. The severity ranges from a brief smell of smoke or oil, to some form of impairment.
</p>

<a name="51101w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The numbers of reports made to CAA since 1995 are as follows and in parentheses are the number of those events that involved pilot impairment.

</p>

<a name="51101w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>As a result of these reports, all of which were investigated, specific continued airworthiness actions have been taken in respect of BAe146 and Boeing 757 aircraft to mitigate any effects and to reduce the frequency of occurrence.
</p>

<a name="51101w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The CAA believes that the increase in reports received in recent years is due to better reporting. However, the number of events where impairment has been reported has remained low.

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="51101w01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Civil Aviation Authority commissioned the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) to investigate whether fumes connected with aircraft engine oil were linked to transient symptoms experienced by pilots <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="51101w01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Civil Aviation Authority assesses reports of air contamination and takes action, either directly or through the European Aviation Safety Agency, if a threat to aircraft safety is identified. Air contamination would be considered to make an aircraft unairworthy if it was likely to incapacitate the aircraft&#039;s flight crew.
</p>

<a name="51101w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>To protect the safety of any flight on which an unexpected failure occurs the CAA directs crews to don their oxygen masks whenever they suspect that the crew air supply has been contaminated.

The United Kingdom treats children according to the standards laid down in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). However, upon signing up to the UNCRC, the United Kingdom entered a reservation that made it clear that nothing in the UNCRC was to be interpreted as affecting the operation of UK immigration and nationality law.

<p><a name="wa_st_9"></a>
<a name="51101w01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The Government are taking forward a number of reforms intended to minimise miscarriages of justice, both for defendants and victims. These include provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to ensure that the correct charges are brought, with the Crown Prosecution Service assuming the responsibility for determining the charge in cases other than routine offences. The 2003 Act also amended the provisions governing the disclosure to the defence of unused prosecution material to introduce a new single objective test for disclosure. This should assist in ensuring that relevant material is disclosed to the defence earlier. The independent Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) recently announced that two academics have been given permission to review cases that the CCRC has considered dating back to 1997, when the commission was established. The research includes an examination of expert evidence, with specific reference as to whether changes might assist in avoiding future miscarriages of justice.

<p><a name="wa_qn_9"></a>
<a name="51101w02_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_9"></a>What progress has been made with the Department for Work and Pensions&#039; feasibility study to determine the measurement of extra costs falling on people with long-term disabilities and their carers.  [HL1798]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_10"></a>
<a name="51101w02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  The department published the results of <i>Meeting long-term information needs on disability: a feasibility report</i> in September, in the research report series, number 267. Copies are available in the Library. The feasibility study assessed whether and how it would be possible to meet a range of information needs on disability&#151;including the extra costs of disability.
</p>

<a name="51101w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>On the same day the department published a <i>Review of existing research on the extra costs of disability</i>, in September in the working paper series, number 21. Copies are available in the Library.
</p>

<a name="51101w02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>This review found that there is substantial disagreement over what constitutes the extra costs disabled people may face, and also over how to measure them. Several approaches have been used and, while there is general agreement that disabled people do experience extra costs, results vary significantly as to the level and nature of these costs.
</p>

<a name="51101w02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>The department is currently considering how to take forward the recommendations made in the feasibility study.

<a name="51101w02_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  The Government have not undertaken any studies into the relative merits of subterranean and overhead cables for connecting offshore generation.
</p>

<a name="51101w02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>To date all power transmission offshore has involved undersea cables. There are a number of severe technical difficulties, which would appear to preclude an overhead pylon system at sea and therefore the feasibility of such a system would be a matter for the electricity industry to consider.

<p><a name="wa_st_12"></a>
<a name="51101w02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Planning for housing policies, currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3 (PPG3), aim to secure sustainable, well-designed development that makes the best use of land, and which is sensitive to the impact it has on the environment and the surrounding area. Where planning applications are made for permission to be given to add a second or third storey to a house, it will be for local planning authorities to consider such applications on their individual merits, having regard to local circumstances set out in their development plans and to the guidance set out in PPG3. The Government do not therefore consider it necessary to introduce into national planning policy guidance the presumption suggested by the noble Lord.

This research was recently updated by IPPR based on figures for 2003&#150;04 (Sriskandarajah, Cooley and Reed: <i>Paying their way: the fiscal contribution of immigrants in the UK</i>, IPPR, London, 2005). This found that migrants (defined as the foreign born) accounted for 9.6 per cent of the population, yet 1 per cent of government revenue and only 9.1 per cent of government expenditure. The Government do not calculate the capital cost of providing infrastructure as a means of determining the number of immigrants who should be admitted to the UK.

It has a specific duty under the Police Reform Act 2002 to keep itself informed about the nature and handling of all complaints and conduct matters arising in the Metropolitan Police Service. If any disciplinary matters regarding an officer above the rank of chief superintendent arises from the IPCC investigation into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Metropolitan Police Authority must deal with them under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004. In regard to the complaint against the commissioner of the metropolis, the Metropolitan Police Authority must deal with it, subject to the requirements of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Police Reform Act 2002. If the IPCC determines that the complaint must be investigated by the Metropolitan Police Authority, then the authority must refer the matter to the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will nominate a person to conduct the investigation.

The Home Office has issued new guidance to make sure that the electronic monitoring service providers respond to all future curfew violations and report them promptly in line with contractual obligations. The company that was responsible for monitoring the offender has altered its own procedures to bring them into line with our requirements. The Scottish Executive manage a separate contract for electronic monitoring in Scotland. There are no electronic monitoring services in Northern Ireland.
