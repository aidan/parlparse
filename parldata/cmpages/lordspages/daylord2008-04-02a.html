On 23 January, we announced an independent review of the private rented sector, which will look at security of tenure.</p>

Is she aware that I raised this matter 12 years ago from the opposition Front Bench? Private shorthold tenants can be expelled under Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 because they ask for improvements to their property, even though under health and safety regulations they are entitled to do so.

I am absolutely sympathetic to those tenants who face what we call retaliatory eviction by unscrupulous landlords. The point was that the CAB did not come forward with this report until mid-year 2007, and we acted immediately. The then Minister, Yvette Cooper, was inspired to set up the review by Julie Rugg, because it enables us to look at the context of the issue. The CAB welcomed the review. We have to understand the scale of the problem. It is not at all clear how many people are affected. We also need to avoid unintended consequences. We need a thriving private rented sector and we need to keep good landlords in the market. That is why a systematic review is important. This is not about avoiding action; it is about getting it right.</p>

Local authorities have those powers and we want them to use them. Part of the problem that was identified in the report is that tenants are evicted before they get a chance to see the local authority taking action. That is why we need to look at the problem, but we need to do so in the context of the condition of the private rented sector as a whole, which, although it is getting better, is still not as good as it should be.</p>

In light of the fact that some &#163;120 billion has now swamped the buy-to-let market and there are now more than 500,000 private landlords of very variable quality, perhaps the time has now come for some regulation for this sector.</p>

Since 1988 and the Housing Act, we have seen an increase in the private rented sector from 9 per cent to 12 per cent of the market, which is a good thing. Nevertheless, it is time that we looked conscientiously and comprehensively at this sector to see how it can be improved.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08040251000261"></a>&#147;Responsible landlords get no benefit from retaliatory evictions and accredited landlords have no need for them&#148;?</p>

In fact, it is exactly a year since we introduced it. One million deposits have been protected in that time, which means that &#163;885 million of cash has been safeguarded by the scheme. Many of those tenants will be students. There are areas of the country in which students are congregated and it is worth saying that, although students bring enormous economic and social benefits to those areas, we are looking at what we might do with interested local authorities and universities to identify ways in which we can ease some of the pressures in those areas.</p>

From what he has said, I am sure he is aware that, while feedstock prices have gone up by 50 per cent, the British pig producer is losing roughly &#163;26 per finished pig. If that continues, there will not be a British industry to talk about. I noted that pork was on the luncheon menu in the Peers&#146; Dining Room, which I hope came from a British source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08040251000033"></a>I should like to ask my noble friend for help in two ways. First, he mentioned the supermarkets. Will he join the campaign to get better prices for UK pig producers and ensure that it is passed down and does not get stuck in the supply chain to the farmers? Secondly, with the highest animal welfare standards in the world, will the Minister do something about the unfair competition from importers who have nothing near our animal welfare standards?</p>

If the supermarkets want to see the end of English pork production, they are going exactly the right way about it. We fully support the claims of the industry that it should get a fairer share of the price, but we cannot interfere on that. It is true that we have the highest welfare standards in the world. Some other countries in Europe&#151;Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany&#151;certainly have high standards. However, the real issue is that World Trade Organisation rules do not allow welfare standards to be raised as part of the deals, which we are pressing in the European Union to get on to the WTO agenda.</p>

However, as most of the pork sold comes through a very small number of supermarkets which have almost a monopoly on the sale of pork, is it not an issue that could be referred to the competition authorities? These supermarkets are keeping the price artificially low, which is affecting the industry. As the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, pointed out, pork is on the menu in the Peers&#146; Dining Room. It is from a rare breed, which will be the case for the whole of the British pig industry in the next three or four years.</p>

On the totality of pork, ham and bacon, as much of that is consumed as lamb and beef in this country, so consumption is large. But the Danes have also suffered from the high feed prices&#151;they represent 60 per cent of production costs.

It is in part due to the trend to move away from growing wheat and soya for animal feed to growing these crops for biofuels&#151;especially in South American countries, such as Brazil&#151;which is much more profitable.

We have had two poor summers which led to bad harvests, while the problems in Australia and the growth in consumption across Asia and China have been major factors. However, the noble Lord has raised another issue. We must make sure that biofuels do not replace food crops, which would result in the price of food going up.</p>

Labelling for food shows where the product underwent its last significant process as opposed to where the food was grown or reared. This is something we are dealing with through the European Union, and the Food Standards Agency is undertaking consultation on better labelling proposals. But what underlies the noble Lord&#146;s question is the need to get the message across to British consumers. We need to make it clear that extra costs on farmers are reflected in the price. That

The Leader of the Opposition chided the Prime Minister over the increase in the price of milk, but for the past 18 months Tory MPs have been queuing up at my office and demanding that I get more money to our dairy farmers.

He will have seen press reports at the weekend that according to UEFA the Football Association&#146;s bid to stage the 2010 Champions League final at Wembley was dismissed for the reason that Her Majesty's Government, unlike the authorities in Germany and Spain, could not give an undertaking that the players taking part would not be subject to British taxation. As my noble friend knows, UEFA takes the view that they should be taxed only in their country of domicile. As the Government&#146;s position may have been misunderstood, would Ministers allow my noble friend Lord Triesman to get back in touch with Mr Platini and make it clear that we are anxious to see the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley and indeed the 2012 final at Cardiff?

But, of course, we did stage the European cup finals in 2002 and 2004 under the tax arrangements that are still in force and have obtained over the past two decades. It may be that UEFA has misunderstood the position, which has caused it to make this decision on 2010&#151;but we note that it is leaving open the decision on where the final should take place in 2011. Wembley will undoubtedly be a key bidder. There is time for us to clear up this matter.</p>

This country has reciprocal bilateral arrangements with other countries, made on the basis of firm agreements. Therefore, we will have some work to do to identify the nature of UEFA&#146;s concern. In so far as UEFA expressed it in terms of Britain withholding tax with regard to matches played here, that is not so. UEFA is labouring under a misapprehension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08040251000084"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have had substantial and helpful debate, both in this House and in another place, on Clause 9, which sets out the purposes of sentencing for under-18s. The debate on Clause 9 has encapsulated much of our informed debate about the purpose and outcome of the youth justice system as a whole. Clause 9 is designed to clarify the current law and to remove a potential source of confusion for sentencers. It has been strongly welcomed by the Youth Justice Board and the Magistrates&#146; Association. It will, of course, underpin and inform the new community sentencing structure with its emphasis on rehabilitation and tailored interventions. It is very important that we get this clause right.</p>

The court should also have regard to the purposes of sentencing, as set out in subsection (4), and to the welfare of the offender in accordance with Section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Many noble Lords took the opportunity to

Many felt that the welfare of the child was subordinate in the clause, a point that the Joint Committee on Human Rights made explicitly.</p>

<a name="80402-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08040251000086"></a>We have listened carefully to noble Lords; the  group of amendments that I have tabled reflects that fact. We believe that our amendments are compatible with our international obligations under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The amendments will, I hope, remove any argument about a hierarchy within the purposes of sentencing. Essentially, the court will have to have equal regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system, the welfare of the young person and the purposes of sentencing. I believe that the amendments clarify the position. I hope that they will reassure noble Lords that we do not believe that the welfare of the child should be a subordinate consideration. I am happy to make it clear that the welfare of the offender is a primary consideration and must be considered by the court as such. I beg to move.</p>

I thank the Minister for listening to the various submissions made on this matter in Committee and for taking some steps towards removing the hierarchy to which he referred. However, in the classic terms of old Liberal assemblies, it does not go far enough. Consequently we are taking this opportunity in Amendment No. 47 to amend the principles of the youth justice system as set out in Section 37 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.</p>

<p><a name="08040251000243"></a>as set out in Section 37(1) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. However, we urge your Lordships to consider that that Act was passed in 1998 and that matters in relation to youth offenders have moved on considerably since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08040251000089"></a>Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that,</p>

<p><a name="08040251000244"></a>In domestic law, the Children Act 1989 establishes that decisions taken by the family court, dealing with a whole range of children&#146;s issues, must be taken in the child&#146;s best interests through the use of the welfare checklist. The 1998 Act was something of an exception. Not only did it address solely children who offend, but it stressed that the primary aim, to which I referred, is the prevention of offending above all other considerations.</p>

It contains a sentence that I always regard with some affection. When a child is born and the new baby is presented to the mother and father, the father, Steve Martin, looks at the mother and says: &#147;What a wonderful gift this child is, and so far we have done nothing to harm it&#148;. That encapsulates in my mind where an awful lot of the problems that bring young people before the courts start. Maltreatment leads to

Children who offend grow up in an environment of poor parental supervision with a lack of discipline or with harsh and erratic parenting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08040251000091"></a>At earlier stages of the Bill, we talked about  the role models that lead children to go astray. Children who offend have an increased likelihood of living in poor housing and experiencing family conflict. Their role models are their parents and grandparents but these families have a history of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08040251000092"></a>In young offender institutions within the prison system, children are treated as prisoners. They are confined. The staff are generally trained as though they were prison officers. Although it is suggested that courses should be offered, the atmosphere is that of a prison and not of a place where children can be persuaded to change their offending behaviour and to discuss problems or difficulties that they may have with safe and trusted adults.</p>

In the context of detained children and young people, this principle is vital to the rehabilitation of the child and to his or her ability to be an effective citizen when released. However, law and practice in the UK relating to children and young people in detention calls into question the Government's commitment to that principle&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08040251000246"></a>We want a complete change in youth justice policy so that we do not treat children in the same way as we treat adults; that is, by locking them up to prevent offending and reoffending. We want the recommendations in the <I>Children&#146;s Plan </I>to be followed. We submit that the signal given by our amendment is important&#151;that the principal aim of the youth justice system is to promote the welfare of children and in so doing to have particular regard to the need to prevent offending, including reoffending. In other words, we wish to shift the balance and the emphasis from punishment to rehabilitation&#151;to putting children on the correct road.</p>

The amendment of the Liberal Democrats, Amendment No. 47, would be even better; none the less, I recognise the great improvement in Amendment No. 36. I refer to one element of it. Proposed subsection (2)(b) refers to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 and uses the word &#147;welfare&#148;. It is about time that &#147;welfare&#148; was updated to be relevant to 2008. Section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989 specifies that the welfare of the child is paramount, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said, but it is interesting that Section 1(3) also provides a checklist on the way in which &#147;welfare&#148; is to be understood by judges and magistrates in the family courts. I am not suggesting that every item on that checklist would be appropriate for young offenders, but some would be. One of them is, for example,</p>
<ul><a name="08040251000310"></a>&#147;his physical, emotional and educational needs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000101"></a>The Government should, not necessarily in primary legislation&#151;and I appreciate that I have not put down an amendment&#151;but somewhere, provide something similar to the checklist in the Children Act to guide magistrates, in particular, and judges on how they should interpret &#147;welfare&#148;, whether that is done under Amendment No. 36 or Amendment No. 47. We would then know what welfare really means and give it the prominence and significance that it should have. It must not just be a word, but have real meaning. Somewhere that meaning should be elucidated, so that judges and magistrates can use and rely on it when considering sentencing.</p>

I suppose that the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, rather than the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 or the Children Act 1989, was selected because what is left of the 1933 Act is essentially criminal statute. The submission of the noble and learned Baroness is extremely powerful. The concept of the welfare of a child is indivisible. There is nothing wrong in taking a term out of what is essentially a civil statute&#151;the 1989 Act. For those reasons, very respectfully, I completely support what has been said.</p>

I, too, feel that it does not go far enough and I am also grateful to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for her contribution. Her contribution to all our discussions, given her background in the Family Court, has been invaluable and has given us an insight into how far the criminal justice part of dealing with children has moved away from the mainstream.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08040251000104"></a>I want to speak, in particular, to Amendments Nos. 37 and 40 in my name and those of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and others, and I am grateful to them for adding their names. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and I tabled these amendments as a result of the study of the Bill by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which we are both members. In his absence, I shall briefly try to do justice to our argument once more.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08040251000105"></a>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which we are party, says that in all measures imposed on children, the best interests of the child shall be paramount. The point of stating that in the convention is that children are different from adults. They are vulnerable, are not yet developmentally formed and are growing up, so we protect them. They are not allowed to marry until a certain age, go to war or drink. In its simplest form, that article in the convention applies also to the way in which we deal with those who have broken the law, are deemed to have broken the law or have done damage and harm to others. Nothing whatever anywhere in the convention suggests that a child puts him or herself beyond its terms by having been charged with a criminal offence, and in no country in the world does anyone claim that.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08040251000106"></a>Therefore, the system for dealing with under-18s should be different because it should be shaped by those ideas. One way in which it should be different is by imposing measures that look to solutions to the problem&#151;solutions that aid the development of the child to grow up into a law-abiding adult.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08040251000107"></a>I am very grateful to the Minister for the Answer that he gave me yesterday to a Written Question. I must admit that I was astonished by the Answer. I was astonished, first, by the information in it and then I was astonished&#151;and, indeed, ashamed&#151;that I was not already aware of that information. I asked the Minister how many people under 18 were serving indeterminate sentences for public protection and the age of those people. Noble Lords may, or may not, be as surprised as I was to hear that 48 people under the age of 18 are serving indeterminate sentences for public protection and that, of these, 17 are aged 15.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08040251000108"></a>Since the sentence has been available, of those under 18 sentenced to an indeterminate sentence for public protection, five have had a tariff of one year or less and 56 have had a tariff of one to two years. Therefore, I make the assumption&#151;I hope, rightly&#151;that their offences were not murder, rape and so on or offences that threatened life, as there are other provisions in the law under which they would have been sentenced for such crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08040251000109"></a>As of 31 January this year, not one of those 48 children had been released. That seems to be a very good example of why there must be a system of youth

If we had such a system, I think that serious questions would be asked about the appropriateness of indeterminate sentences for public protection for 15 year-olds.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08040251000110"></a>I want to end with an example. This morning, I chaired a meeting organised by INQUEST to launch a publication about women who die in prison. One of the speakers was Kirsty Blanksby. Kirsty was one of two sisters who came from a troubled background and caused a lot of trouble when she was a child. She got into the mental health system, went to a therapeutic community and there she was, sitting on the podium in Committee Room 9 this morning, addressing a meeting in the Houses of Parliament&#151;a very fine, articulate young woman. Her sister Petra, in the same situation, got into the justice system. Kirsty is living a normal, full life; Petra is dead. She killed herself in New Hall prison just as she reached the age of 19.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08040251000111"></a>I use that example to make the point again that putting the welfare of the child first is also putting the welfare of society first. Solving Kirsty&#146;s problems was worth it for her and for us. I support the amendments. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08040251000113"></a>I prefer Amendment No. 47 to the earlier amendment as it shifts the balance towards responding to the many problems encountered by young people in our society which derive, one way or another, from a lack of love in childhood. That is the root of the problem, and the chaos in family life these days in our society feeds that. We see that from the news this morning about Shannon in Yorkshire and the family circumstances from which she has come. Also, the prevalence of child pornography in the news this morning illustrates the underlying culture that we face. As a bishop, I visit youth offending institutions and it is often chilling to see the way in which they operate. Young people are regularly sworn at&#151;I could give more details. We need a change of culture in our approach to youth justice. I am grateful to the Minister for the move that he has indicated in his introduction to this government amendment, but I believe that Amendment No. 47 points us in a better direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08040251000115"></a>I have two observations to make about the text of the amendment. There have been various references to the UN convention, our obligations to children and the importance of recognising that in our legislation. The amendment is significant because it talks not about &#147;children&#148; but about the &#147;offender&#148;. That is immensely significant because it leads on to suggest that we must move towards tailor-made systems that really examine the predicament and situation of the individual child caught up in what has happened and what he has caused to happen. We must see what will enable a child to become a rehabilitated, positive and creatively participating member of society, taking a responsible role in society.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08040251000116"></a>Whenever we talk about welfare we need to expand that to spell out what we really mean because welfare could be a matter of protecting a child. I believe that the convention and any enlightened approach to these matters suggest that we must have a policy which is far more imaginative than simply looking at welfare. We need to look at the rehabilitation of the individual concerned.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08040251000117"></a>I hope that my noble friend will forgive me for making those points, but within the context I thank him for having brought the amendments, because they help us to create a dynamic for moving forward. As we move forward, I wonder whether we shall more frequently look at what is happening north of the border in Scotland. I am impressed that, for 40 years, they have had working rather successfully in Scotland the panel hearing system, which looks not only at the particular individual offence of which the child is accused, but the whole situation of the child, of which the offence is a part, and what will be appropriate for helping to put things right.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08040251000118"></a>It is true that that has so far operated only for children up to 16, but as I understand it, active consideration in Scotland is being given to the possibility of extending it to 18. I hope that, as we all consider the future, we are not too proud south of the border to learn from those who seem to be having some success in these respects north of it.</p>

Unfortunately, the aim here is not clear, because it confuses preventing &#147;offending&#148; with preventing &#147;reoffending&#148;, which are not the same thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08040255000002"></a>Given that the Act from which the provision was taken dates from 1998 reminded me of the anticipation with which we awaited the arrival of this Government following the statement of Mr Blair that he was going to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. Appreciating that the causes of crime were in society, we hoped that that would mean a bringing of society into the resolution of the causes and therefore the prevention of crime. Soon after that, the new Government realised that the criminal  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>justice system&#151;the police, the courts, prisons and probation&#151;were in a mess; they were not a united system; they represented rather more four warring tribes competing with other for ever-diminishing resources rather than realising that their efforts, if aggregated, could produce a better solution that was much more geared to protecting the public than if they continued separately. So, very wisely, the Government gave them a uniting aim, which was to protect the public by preventing crime. I have no argument with this sentiment, but the word &#147;prevent&#148; is wrong in this context, because the criminal justice system does not click in until after a crime has been committed. That is not to say that there are not certain activities of the police which are geared towards crime prevention, but the criminal justice system, the investigation of the crime by the police, the sentencing and then the administration of the sentence by the prison and probation services are all about preventing reoffending, which is not the same thing at all. I notice that this aim for the youth justice system was given to it at exactly the same time. All that one has done is cross out the word &#147;criminal justice system&#148; and put &#147;youth justice system&#148; and given it the same aim: preventing reoffending.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08040255000003"></a>At the same time, I was looking at the aim of the Prison Service, which is,</p>
<ul><a name="08040255000072"></a>&#147;to keep securely those committed by the courts, to treat them with humanity and to help them to lead useful and law-abiding lives".</ul>
<p><a name="08040255000040"></a>Here my background as a soldier came into play and I realised that there was not one aim in that but three, and you cannot have three aims. Security is put first, which is why security seems to run everything. In fact, if we are talking about preventing reoffending, helping people to live useful and law-abiding lives should come first, with the qualification that they must not be allowed to escape and must be treated with humanity. My noble friend Lady Stern and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, made the point that what is missing from that aim is that it should be in the interests of the child. Saying that the aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending, which it is not, is missing that the aim of the system is to help young people to live useful and law-abiding lives and to rehabilitate them using methods that are appropriate to them as children. I hoped that, after listening to us, the general spirit of making children count would have been reflected in revised aims and principles for the youth justice system that would be put in the Bill.</p>

Alone among those who have contributed to the debate, I shall look in a little more detail at the new clause inserted by Amendment No. 47, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. As I understand it at the moment, I do not share the general view that it would be better than government Amendment No. 36, which I welcome. I do not know how the court, seeking to follow the guidance that it gives, could be expected to understand what it is supposed to do. The new clause states:</p>

<p><a name="08040255000042"></a>What should the court gain from the word &#147;particular&#148;? Is it intentional that there is no reference to the reform and rehabilitation of offenders, the protection of the public or the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences? All those are to be found in Clause 9(4). The new clause proposed would be a source of confusion for a court, and I genuinely look forward to hearing what the noble Lord will say about that to dispel my confusion, if he winds up on his proposed new clause.</p>

Despite what I heard from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, I still feel that the phrasing of Amendment No. 47 better reflects what one would like to see happening than the amendment tabled by the Government. Taking the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, we are still talking about children and young people. The main aim is that they are treated as such, whether we are thinking about prevention, paying back to society or whatever. They come from the most deprived backgrounds, whether they have been subjected to ill treatment or just to inadequate treatment and parenting. It was, above all, the comments made by my noble friend Lady Stern that made one concentrate on this issue.</p>

<a name="80402-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08040255000006"></a>The very fact that that huge number of children, some as young as 13 or 15, should be serving indeterminate sentences, which may be short in theory but are likely to continue for a considerable time, is horrifying. We also know from reports by the Chief Inspector of Prisons about growing concern about self-harming. In 2004-05, there were approximately 25 incidents per week of children self-harming. That is not sensible; it is not the right way to be dealing with children and young persons, so I hope that we can look at this again.</p>

The more one thinks about it, the more one realises how confused that statement is. I am sure that it could easily be put right, but it is of the greatest importance that we should know exactly the aim of the youth justice system and not confuse those two very different things: offending and reoffending.</p>

I was very moved by the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the story that she told of the two sisters, and by the reference of the right reverend Prelate to the lack of love. Rehabilitation and help for children should be the dominant features of any measures that we introduce. The degree to which children are affected by the absence of love is dramatic. We must all have seen it in our own lives: a family in which love appears to be absent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08040255000009"></a>I turned on the &#147;Today&#148; programme as I drove in today and heard about internet communications between very young children who are putting in the public arena information about how they live, what they look like, and so on. The plea is being made that parents should intervene to protect the children. We have the desperate situation of unloved children in houses and households where there is no room. There is no table at which anyone ever has a meal; and there is never a collective meal. The degree of deprivation is so intense. We ought to be aware of that all the time as we think of the people we are dealing with&#151;these miserable, unfortunate children aged 15, languishing in some prison with an indeterminate sentence. What is their background? What terrible upbringing have they had to lead to that?</p>

<a name="08040255000010"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08040255000080"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b></b> My Lords, in considering these clauses in Committee, your Lordships will have heard one of the most distinguished debates that has ever taken place in your Lordships' House, greatly enriching the pages of <I>Hansard</I>. It is a testimony to the self-discipline of all your Lordships this afternoon that your Lordships have restrained yourselves from repeating all those matters, but have taken them as a backcloth to the observations made on the amendments today.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08040255000011"></a>What underlay those debates was the concern  about the failure to give welfare its proper weight in the youth justice system. We know, to some  extent, why that happened. Following Section 44 of the 1933 Act&#151;a remarkable achievement for all those years ago&#151;and then our international commitments to the United Nations convention, we had this curious clause in the 1998 Act, which seemed to retrace our steps all the way back to the 1920s and before. Ever since then, we have been striving to work our way back. The victim of all this has been the welfare of  the child.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08040255000012"></a>One has seen this outlined in so many ways. We have seen how children in trouble with the law are much more likely to have grown up in an environment of poor parental supervision and a lack of discipline&#151;a factor that has been virtually ignored by the law in the past 10 years. We have seen how there are all too few opportunities for children in custody to get the kind of rehabilitation that they need in order to re-enter the world with a reasonable chance of not reoffending. I particularly remember the graphic incidents described by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, in which there have been serious breaches of human rights in young offender institutions.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08040255000013"></a>This balance desperately needs to be redressed, which is what the three non-government amendments are about. I congratulate the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, as so many other noble Lords have done, on saying right at the beginning how pleased she was that the Government have moved on this matter. If I may say with great respect to the Minister, there was no doubt that the text in the Bill simply did not conform to our international obligations, and I am delighted to see that the noble Lord has come up with a text which is a substantial improvement to what was in the original Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08040255000014"></a>We are presented with three different texts, which all have their merits. The great merit of Amendment No. 47 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is that he confronts Section 37 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 head on in a way that none of the other amendments does. That is extremely attractive because the law began to go wrong following our United Nations commitments. It is therefore right that it should be confronted.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08040255000015"></a>I share the concerns expressed my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden about proposed subsection (2) in Amendment No. 47, but my biggest hesitation about the amendment, which I do not have about either of the other two, is that it is not clear who should promote the welfare of the child under the amendment. Under Amendments No. 36 and 37, it is quite plain that the duty to protect the welfare of the child is on the court. The best that one can say about Amendment No. 47 is that the duty is on the system, but which part of the system will be responsible? I suppose the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will say that all parts of the system will be responsible, from the prosecution all the way to the moment when the child finally walks free from whatever institution in which he or she has been incarcerated. I say that not because I in any way question the spirit behind the amendment. Anyone listening to the noble Lord can be in no doubt whatever that he is coming at this problem from exactly the same place that I do; but as your Lordships will have to make up your minds this afternoon about what to do about the amendments, those, for what they are worth, are my hesitations about Amendment No. 47.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08040251000133"></a>Amendment No. 37, in the names of my noble friend Lord Onslow, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Ramsbotham, has many attractions. It would place responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the court, which must be right. The only real distinction between Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 is one of emphasis.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08040251000134"></a>When thinking about this, I have been in some considerable difficulty. The emphasis in Amendment No. 37 is much more strongly on the welfare of the offender than on the need to have regard to preventing offending or reoffending. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, would agree that some of the criticisms that he made about offending and reoffending in Amendment No. 36 also apply to Amendment  No. 37. The principal distinction between Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 is the weighting. The Government just get over the hurdle in Amendment No. 36. I am not very happy about the principal aim, but I have to confess that the court must have regard to the three factors equally. It is clear that the shackles that so heavily anchored welfare in the text of the Bill have been successfully unlocked.</p>

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="08040251000135"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08040251000415"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b></b> My Lords, the noble Lord has in his remarks pointed the way to the difference between Amendments Nos. 36 and 47. In Amendment No. 36, the court is the sentencing court. The principal aim of the youth justice system is a broad aim that affects every agency dealing with young offenders. I am sure that he would agree with that, as he has already pointed the way towards it.</p>

<a name="08040251000136"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80402-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08040251000416"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b></b> My Lords, I hope that in making my observations about the noble Lord&#146;s amendment I paid due tribute to the spirit that lay behind it. We are dealing with a sentencing system. Although welfare should infect every part of the youth justice system, for the purposes of this Bill the crucial institution is the court. Therefore, the judges must be absolutely clear what obligations lie on their shoulders, which is why I made my observations about the importance of having someone specific. I am sure, again, that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with his experience in another existence, would agree that personal responsibility above all is central. I believe that it is central that the Bill, because it is about sentencing, points to the sentencing authority, which is what Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 do.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08040251000137"></a>My other concern about Clause 9 lies in the purposes subsection. As I think I observed in Committee, there is nothing to distinguish the purposes of sentencing under Clause 9, which are referred to in proposed new subsection (2)(c), from the purposes of sentencing adults. I do not know whether at this stage the Minister would care to look at that again, but it underlies many of the observations made by many of your Lordships. I pick out again the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, only because, in Committee, she led the debate on this issue. Time and again, she has been at pains to say that children are different from adults. Therefore, it is very difficult to talk about the purposes of sentencing for children in a way that is identical to the purposes of sentencing for adults. I would very much like the Minister to say something about that.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08040251000138"></a>Having made those observations, I should like once again to congratulate the Minister on making&#151;given the rhetoric of the Government in another place&#151;a remarkable advance in sympathetic thinking on this most important matter of all in our justice system.</p>

We are clear on the considerations that will now come to your Lordships&#146; House if these amendments are put to the vote. I also thank particularly the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his generous welcome for the government amendment, although clearly he thinks that it does not go far enough; nevertheless, his welcome is appreciated. I have not seen the film &#147;Parenthood&#148;, although it sounds interesting. Those of us who are parents can always learn more. The use of the phrase &#147;do no harm&#148; reminds me of the injunction made by Florence Nightingale to the health service: &#147;First, do no harm&#148;. I suggest that that is not a bad principle for many public services.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08040251000140"></a>I accept that we are talking about those who are in many cases very troubled young people. As the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and other noble Lords graphically illustrated, their lives are often wretched, short of love, deprived and open to many temptations. The internet was mentioned. I agree strongly with the sentiments expressed, especially in relation to extreme pornography, which we shall debate later. Equally, it is  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remarkable how many young people from such backgrounds do not enter a life of crime. In our consideration of these matters, we have to ensure that the system as a whole reflects this fact.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08040251000141"></a>We warmly welcome the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in this House. However, I think that it is useful to have the words &#147;prevent offending&#148; as well as &#147;prevent reoffending&#148;, because that underlines the holistic aim of the whole criminal justice system. I am afraid that I use health service analogies from time to time, but it is rather like the noble Lord saying that the only responsibility of a hospital is to cure sick people. I would argue that a hospital not only provides a sickness service but forms a part of our health service. It is important that we are able to reflect on the overall aims of the system.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08040251000142"></a>We are all concerned about the number of young people entering custody and some of the outcomes; again, I reflect the concerns about self-harm among those young people. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, mentioned restraint. He will know that we are undertaking a review of the issue following the debate on the statutory instrument. Clearly, we are keen to see the outcome of that review in the next  few months.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08040251000143"></a>However, we should not ignore the improvements that have been made in the youth justice system. There is much greater co-ordination and the youth offending teams are doing a good job. Yes, they could do better, and the annual report of the inspection of their work indicates that there are areas where improvements need to be made, but we should not ignore the advances that have been made or the additional resources that are being put into education. I have seen for myself in a number of places the real dedication of those working with young people serving in custodial settings to improve their lot and their lives.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08040251000144"></a>The youth crime action plan is due to be published in the summer. It will set out cross-government arrangements for tackling the level of crime and reoffending rates while also recognising the significant personal challenges faced by young people and the fact that the system has been criticised for not going far enough to meet their needs or protect their welfare. The plan will pick up and develop the very ideas that my noble friend Lord Judd and the right reverend Prelate have talked about today, but it must also consider public concern about youth crime.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08040251000145"></a>On welfare, to which we devoted much discussion, I welcome the intervention of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, with all her experience. Part of the job of the courts in taking account of pre-sentence reports will be to assess welfare. The pre-sentence report will be based on what is called an &#147;asset assessment&#148;, which will take account of any existing child protection plan, pastoral support, individual education plan, care plan, children in need assessment and pathway plan. So the mechanism is there.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08040251000146"></a>On the noble and learned Baroness&#146;s comments on whether the courts understand welfare, one would think that they ought to. She says that more must be done and, given all her experience, I accept that. We  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to look at the provision of youth justice in the Bill. I will, of course, ensure that in doing so it will take account of and, I hope, embrace some of her comments.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08040251000147"></a>There can be no doubt that welfare must be a key consideration for young offenders. That is the purpose behind government Amendment No. 36. However, we must also look beyond the needs of the young offender and address the needs of their victims and the public. That is why we must ensure that the courts consider the need for reparation and financial compensation. We must acknowledge that the public also expect an offender to be punished for their wrongdoing. The public may be accepting of the view that a young person should not be punished as severely as an adult but they are unlikely to accept that punishment should not be considered at all.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08040251000148"></a>There has been great discussion on the convention, what it means and the definition of a primary consideration. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for his remarks on the drafting of the amendment, which he said just about passed muster; I will accept that. In our work between Committee and Report, we have looked at volume 1 of the <I>Legislative History </I><I>of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</I>. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08040251000313"></a>&#147;a number of delegations questioned whether the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in all actions. It was generally noted that there were situations in which the competing interests, <I>inter alia</I>, of justice and of the society at large should be of at least equal, if not, greater importance than the interests of the child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000250"></a>It says that, in the light of those concerns, it was agreed that the convention should refer to the child&#146;s best interests as &#147;a&#148; primary consideration, to reflect that there are others as well. That is why we have been resistant all along to the suggestion of their being &#147;the&#148; primary consideration and why our amendment is constructed as it is.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08040251000149"></a>I have noted with interest the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on the purposes of sentencing in the clause, which are not to be amended by the government amendment. I do not think that there is anything untoward in the purposes of sentencing as expressed in the Bill, albeit that they are directed at young people. They seem to be entirely reasonable matters that should be considered, although I have no doubt that we could have a further debate on them.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08040251000150"></a>In conclusion, in resisting the other amendments that have been tabled, and in hoping that the House will accept the government amendment, I re-emphasise that we fully understand the importance of the welfare of the child, of ensuring that it is fully considered, understanding some of the circumstances in which young people have got into trouble and wanting to do everything that we can to get them out of trouble. We also think that wider issues will be concerned with the criminal justice system. That is why I hope that the government amendment will commend itself to noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08040255000017"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment came upon me a little more swiftly than I expected; I apologise. This is a short matter compared to previous ones or compared to most matters in the Bill. I have only brought it back to your Lordships because of the very generous offer that the Minister made at the end of his reply to me in Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08040255000046"></a>&#147;I am happy to take away the provision to see whether anything more could be done to encourage more use of the order in the future &#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/2/08; col. 1134.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040255000043"></a>The amendment is about financial compensation orders. The view that I advanced in Committee was that this could be an effective way of impressing on offenders the significance of their crime. We are talking here about fairly low order offences; primarily but not exclusively vandalism. It would be a way of bringing home the reality of the damage that is being done by vandals to law-abiding householders and shopkeepers. I went on to express my surprise that only limited use appeared to be made of the orders in the courtroom.</p>

<a name="80402-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08040255000018"></a>The Minister, fairly, came back to me and made a number of observations. First, he said that a provision in the Bill was not necessary because adequate powers already existed under Section 130 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, where it is clear that a compensation order can be made in favour of a victim. Secondly, he said&#151;and again I entirely accept the reason why the Government made this observation&#151;that quite often the courts take the view that it is so unlikely that the offender would be able to pay that passing such a sentence would in effect be futile. However, the Minister concluded that, because he himself undoubtedly accepted the principle that lay behind the amendment, that he would go away and give the matter some thought and come back to your Lordships on Report. That is why I retabled this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I am thinking particularly of couriers, because they are supposed, on some housing estates, to make a lot of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08040255000020"></a>I had the unhappy experience of being twice burgled by an 18 year-old who had once been the friend of one of my sons and therefore knew the layout of our house. She was ordered to pay &#163;450 compensation by magistrates, at &#163;10 a week. She paid twice, I think; I got &#163;20. Eventually the probation officer got in touch with me and asked if I would mind if the magistrates set that order aside. I said I could not understand why they had made it in the first place. Although I understand that this would give all the powers to the court for under-18s, I wonder whether anyone has ever come across someone who had the money to pay compensation.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for raising the matter with me, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for her interesting comments. I am afraid I cannot take the debate much further than at our last discussion. In 2005-06, the figures I have show that 15,492 compensation orders were made out of 96,000 sentences made in court. That suggests to me that courts find compensation orders are appropriate in a significant number of cases. It also presumes that they consider it feasible for the young person to pay that fine&#151;not, I hope, through criminal practices because clearly that would go against the spirit, and indeed the letter, of the law in terms of the purpose of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08040255000022"></a>The courts have discretion here, although they also have to give reasons for not making an order when they are empowered so to do. I have no hard evidence that this is not working satisfactorily. I agree with the principle of compensation where it is appropriate. In view of this interesting discussion, I undertake to discuss the matter with the Youth Justice Board to see whether, either through guidance or through other actions, more needs to be done in this area.</p>

I should also like to place on record my warm appreciation to those who put their names to this amendment. Indeed, I have heard that more noble Lords wanted to put their names to the amendment than were able to do so, which illustrates the strength of feeling on this issue in the House.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08040255000032"></a>The amendment is quite complicated, legally&#151;I recognise that&#151;and as I said in Committee I am very grateful to those with good legal minds who told me how it should be phrased. I was happy to accept their advice. The purpose of the amendment is to move to a situation in which no young person or child is put into custody unless special purpose-provided accommodation is arranged by the local authority, wherever it may be.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08040255000033"></a>Some have argued that to say that a child must never be put into custody unless those purpose-provided arrangements are available is pushing it too far, because there will always be exceptions. That sounds a very reasonable observation, but my experience is that it is a very dangerous one. As long as one recognises the possibility of exceptions, there will always be a tendency for people to rationalise that a particular case is an exception and that therefore it is necessary to put a child into the wrong kind of custody. That is sometimes just from inertia and sometimes just out of convenience. We have reached the stage when we must say that it is never going to happen&#151;so we need to make sure that the alternative proper accommodation is available. Other countries have done this, and I cannot see why we have to  lag behind.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08040255000034"></a>Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that custody should be a measure of last resort, and for the shortest possible time. I do not want to pull punches this afternoon, because it would not help my noble friend if I did. Our profligate use of custody does not conform to that principle and, too often, in effect, still constitutes a form of state-inflicted  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>violence on young people, victimising children. With some notable and imaginative exceptions, for which prison staff and the non-governmental organisations involved cannot be too highly commended, I argue that custody as it currently operates is just not achieving positive results. The facts speak for themselves: custody does not prevent reoffending or help to make our communities safer. Eighty per cent of under-18 year-olds sentenced to custody reoffend within two years, while 30 per cent of children released from STSs reoffend within one month. It does not provide respite; custody moves crime but does not stop it. Prisons holding young people are frequently violent, drug-ridden centres of crime. Between 2003 and 2006, 18,000 assaults were recorded inside young offender institutions.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08040255000035"></a>It is no exaggeration to say that custody kills children. In 2007, three 15-to-18 year-olds and four 19-to-20 year-olds took their own lives in prison. Since 2000, 79 people aged under 21 have committed suicide in prison. More than 1,000 incidents of self-injury by juveniles in prison were recorded in 2006. I cannot believe that I am alone in asking what kind of society we are living in that we just drift along accepting this nightmare and what is happening under our noses.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08040255000036"></a>Prisons do not work for young people. There is very little exercise, activity or education, even in the juvenile prisons that have had huge additional funding. In Feltham, for example, a new education block was built, but it can accommodate only half the juveniles at any time. In Brinsford Young Offender Institution, the Chief Inspector of Prisons found that children never went outside for exercise, and that prison holds 473 boys aged 15 to 21.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08040255000037"></a>The training and educational levels required of prison officers remain fairly minimal. I do not in any way want to underestimate the daunting task with which they are confronted, nor do I want to underestimate the heroic efforts of some prison staff in dealing with young people, but in this general context, it is disturbing to note that prison officers recently asked for stays because they cannot control children. I hope that I can take an example from my own experience in education: it was from a much more primitive age, but in a first-class school to which I was privileged to go. Some masters used the cane and some taught. Perhaps that is an oversimplification, but discipline problems did not arise with some members of staff who managed to engage the attention and participation of the young. Others had to rely on deterrents to encourage the young to learn. Similarly, it is worrying that the first thing that happens to a young person on reception to prison is a forcible strip search.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08040255000038"></a>Secure training centres exacerbate the problem. I question whether there are not real moral issues involved in the concept of running children's jails for profit. What are children's jails about&#151;profit or the very things that we discussed at length and in depth on a previous amendment? Whatever the arguments in that context, secure training centres clearly fail to solve the children's problems. They have had serious incidents of disorder and death, and they rely on excessive use of physical violence by staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08040255000039"></a>I am sorry if I sound irate about this issue, but I am irate about it. I feel, powerfully, that as a civilised society, the time has come to take a complete change of direction. We have to say that this kind of custody is never going to happen any more. Until we say &#147;never&#148; and therefore have to introduce alternative purpose-built accommodation, that will not happen. And, please, do not let anyone in the tabloid media or elsewhere say that what is being argued is the soft option. It is the tough option. What has too often been called for by the ill-informed media is something which in effect makes a bad situation worse, causes more crime in society, further distorts the odds against the young and is totally counterproductive. In the spirit of all that my noble friend said in introducing the government amendment earlier, I profoundly hope that he can be really reassuring to the House this afternoon. I beg to move.</p>

In the first, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, includes the term &#147;under 21&#148;, whereas we have mostly been talking about juveniles under 18. In the second, he talks about suitable accommodation. He has already given examples of totally unsuitable accommodation. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08040251000181"></a>I could bore your Lordships will endless descriptions of totally unsuitable accommodation, unsuitable treatment and unsuitable conditions for young offenders which I have seen round the country. In many cases, instead of designing suitable accommodation for young people, existing accommodation has been &#147;adapted&#151;so-called&#148;&#151;for their use. I suppose that the classic example of total inappropriateness is the old convict penal establishment at Portland built at the beginning of the 19th century. It is about as unsuitable for young people as anywhere could be. Feltham, one of the few places that was purpose-built, was built to a design taken from America and suitable for a warm climate in California, not for the spaces beside Heathrow Airport.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08040251000182"></a>The other problem is that those between 18 and 21 are totally ignored throughout the penal system. A juvenile system under the Youth Justice Board looks after those under 18, and the prison system is designed for adults, but those between 18 and 21, called young offenders, fall between the two stools. No one is responsible for them within the prison system. They come under the guidance of area managers round the country who have responsibility for many different kinds of prisoners. In young offender institutions that contain both juveniles and young offenders, referred to as split sites, most of the facilities are given to the juveniles, because the Prison Service is under contract to the Youth Justice Board to provide for them, and the 18-to-21s, of whom there

I suppose that one of the classic examples is Brinsford, which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, mentioned.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08040251000183"></a>We have an opportunity to do something about this. As I mentioned in Committee, one opportunity is a design called an academy&#151;a term deliberately chosen in view of the academies being produced by the education department. It is run in the East End of London by an organisation called East Potential. This organisation is proposing a new site consisting of a custody centre&#151;a foyer; a place that holds young homeless people; and a combination of work, education, drug treatment and other suitable facilities, all on site and designed to cater for the needs of a particular catchment area under the guidance of a local authority. It has the advantage that young people will not be taken too far from home. Once they get into the hands of the criminal justice system they will receive continuous mentoring, tutoring, teaching, training or whatever. Furthermore, the local area will be involved in looking after its own as opposed to the scourge of young people, particularly 18-to-21 year-olds, being sent all over the country to where there is a bed rather than to where they should be treated.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08040251000184"></a>I very much hope that, in the spirit in which the Minister has listened to and taken on board some of the points made so far on the Bill, he will take on board the need to do something about this group of young offenders to whom the noble Lord, Lord Judd, drew attention.</p>

It refers both to accommodation and appropriate care and support. Recently I have tabled Written Questions on the number of mental health experts available to treat young people in secure establishments but the Government were unable to tell me how many there are. I shall pursue the matter but it indicates that there is still a very long way to go on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08040251000186"></a>Since we debated this in Committee, Anne Owers published her shocking report on Oakhill, which deals with some of the matters to which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, alluded. She discovered that there was a 59 per cent turnover of staff. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, asked what we are running these homes for. Is it to make a profit or to rehabilitate young people? G4S obviously does not have the same inspection system as a local authority establishment, and if it did it would have been taken into special measures, which is, I think, what Anne Owers&#146;s report was aiming to do. A local authority establishment would never have got away with doing nothing after four critical inspections.</p>

Conditions are very hard for the dedicated staff who have established innovative training systems. They are clearly working under incredible duress in surroundings in which it is difficult to produce the results they want. I shall say no more as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has said it all. The figures reveal a shocking increase in the number of young people who are locked up. I am pleased to support the amendment.</p>

I refer to the Bulger killers, Thompson and Venables. I dealt with an aspect of their case and saw the reports on them. They had been very well cared for in two separate places of secure accommodation where they able to learn of the appalling crime they had committed, to understand it and to move on from it with a great deal of help from, among others, psychiatrists, whose reports I saw. One has only to consider what might have happened to them if they had been slightly older, but well under the age of 18, and had gone in to one of the institutions that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, told us about today and in the past. With any luck, they will, under new identities, live respectable and responsible lives. Their rehabilitation was made possible in good, secure accommodation units.</p>

I would have added my name to it, but it was too popular and there was no space left. It provides a welcome opportunity to talk about the inappropriateness of most of the accommodation in which children and young people are held and to see if we can persuade the Minister that we can do better, given our recent, small successes.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08040251000190"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for the way that he moved the amendment and for what he said about Brinsford. I am grateful to the Printed Paper Office, which always sends me the reports of the Chief Inspector of Prisons. When I do not have time to read the all of the reports, I always look at the sections on time in the open air. I have to tell noble Lords that, so far, one in 10 establishments, including those for juveniles, allow time in the open air every day. That is astonishing, considering that one of the standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners is that everyone shall have time in the open air every day.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08040251000191"></a>Our starting point is that we are discussing vulnerable young people. The starting age for placement in an institution of this nature is, I think, 12. If I am wrong, I am sure that the Minister will tell me. About 200 of the juveniles who are locked up are put in local authority secure children&#146;s homes that are run according to childcare principles, as my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss has told us. The rest we put in prison-like establishments that are run either by the Prison Service, according to its rules, or in secure training centres.</p>

That training manual is secret; but following pressure from the Joint Committee, a redacted version can be seen in the Library. The headings of some of the redacted sections are very interesting and I shall bring them to the attention of noble Lords. The Joint Committee&#146;s report stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08040251000293"></a>&#147;We were alarmed by the headings of some of the redacted sections, namely &#145;hair grab&#146;, &#145;strangle against the wall&#146;, &#145;strangle on the ground&#146;, &#145;kicks standing&#146; and &#145;kicks on the floor&#146;. It was not possible to ascertain the content of these sections&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000252"></a>clearly because they were headings followed by plain white space.</p>

<a name="80402-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08040251000193"></a>One of the secure training centres that trains people according the manual is called Oakhill. The Chief Inspector of Prisons and Ofsted recently inspected it, and I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for referring to the inspection report. The chief inspector said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08040251000294"></a>&#147;For some time, Ofsted and the YJB have been concerned about the centre, particularly the lack of sufficient order and control, without which the safety of both children and staff cannot be assured. As a result, in July 2007 the YJB limited the number of children at the centre to 56 and required the contractor to put in place a recovery plan&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000253"></a>Therefore, 56 of the children locked up in an establishment needed a recovery plan. The Youth Justice Board asked the prisons inspectorate to inspect and the chief inspector concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08040251000295"></a>&#147;Sadly, our inspection confirmed that staff at Oakhill continued to struggle to maintain order and to control safely the children in their care ... The scale of the centre&#146;s difficulties was illustrated most starkly by the staggering levels of use of force by staff, often in response to the all too frequent assaults by children on staff and on other children. In the nine months before the inspection, force was used 757 times. On 532 occasions&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000254"></a>that is, within nine months&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08040251000314"></a>&#147;this involved the highest level of restraint, requiring at least three members of staff, with one holding the child&#146;s head. Without a sharp reduction in these statistics the centre cannot pretend to be anywhere near the recovery required by the YJB&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000255"></a>The chief inspector ended by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08040251000296"></a>&#147;We had some confidence that the new direction could, given time, turn the centre around, but this required the YJB to provide certainty about its future, which was ... unlikely while matters remained at such a low ebb. It might be more realistic for the YJB to empty the centre briefly, so that it can be re-launched with a properly trained and reinvigorated staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000256"></a>I hope the Minister will tell us that it was emptied but I fear that he will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08040251000194"></a>Finally, perhaps I may raise a point about Section 34 of the Offender Management Act 2007, which some of us who were involved in the passage of that legislation will remember. Section 34 gives the Secretary of State power to specify by order types of custodial provision in which a detention and training order may be served in addition to young offender institutions, secure training centres and local authority secure children&#146;s homes. Can the Minister tell us whether that power is being used, how often it has been used and whether it has led to new and interesting therapeutic interventions for young offenders? If it is being used, it could be a basis for implementing this amendment, which I very much support.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Judd, has spelt out the basis for it. It deals with children and young people right the way up to the age of 21 and, above all, it states that there should be specific appropriate accommodation for them. In certain cases, that accommodation would certainly have to be restrictive. Most importantly, we are beginning to see a change of mind about what is appropriate when dealing with young people, and not just among those of us who have been following this issue in one way or another as magistrates or members of the judiciary and so on. People are generally beginning to realise how totally ineffectively we deal with young people who have been damaged. As we heard, eight out of  10 of them reoffend within two years.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08040251000196"></a>My noble friend Lady Stern&#146;s described the sort of activities that are used to restrain youngsters, which are totally appalling and totally ineffective. It is very worrying that we still do not have a government reaction and that there has been further delay because wider research is apparently needed before the Government can come to any conclusion. Smaller units, relevant to the local community, are being recommended, as my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham emphasised, which seems to fit the pattern of what the Corston report argued for women offenders and which would clearly fit this pattern. It is also noticeable that not just the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights was making those points and the international Centre of Crime and Justice Studies, but also the Local Government Association. It is terrifying that 40 per cent of the boys, but 67 per cent of the girls have serious mental health problems. What are we doing about it? We have heard it all and it has been extremely saddening. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

My noble friend Lord Judd said he thought he was irate, but I have always regarded him as a great humanitarian. I have very much welcomed the interventions that he has made in debates on this Bill in the light of that humanitarian concern and, of course, his wide experience. I well understand the concerns expressed by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, speaks from a wide experience of what he describes as unsuitable accommodation for young people. I was also very interested in the comments of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, about how there is potential in the system to help young people, however grievous their crime might have been; the crimes to which she referred were indeed grievous. I agree that custody must be a last resort. Some major challenges lie ahead for the youth justice system as a whole.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08040251000198"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, raised a very interesting point on the numbers in custody. The figures that I have for those in custody at any one time in the under-18 custodial estate are as follows: 10-to-17 year-olds in secure children's homes, 215; 12-to-17 year-olds in secure training centres, 233;  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>15-to-17 year-olds in under-18 YOIs, 2,521; and 18 year-olds still in under-18 YOIs, 262. My understanding is that the use of custody for juveniles has not shown the kind of significant increase that we have seen for adults. At least we can share some degree of satisfaction on that, although we understand that much more needs to be done. I was interested in my noble friend&#146;s comments about reoffending. He is right that some of the reoffending rates are very high. Clearly, we need to do everything that we can to try to get those figures down.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08040251000199"></a>Overall, for all sentences in youth justice, the proven reoffending rate was 40.8 per cent, which was a decrease of 2.5 percentage points since 2000. Within that figure is a wide variation, depending on the type of juvenile disposal. The noble Lord was right that the reoffending rate for custodial disposal is high. That shows that there is a great challenge ahead; it shows also that, inevitably, the young people who end up in custody are always likely to be those who are most susceptible to criminal activity. I am sure that there is great debate about that. What is not in doubt is that there has been some improvement, but it is clear that much more needs to happen.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08040251000200"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, raised some interesting points about 18 to 21 year-olds. He has talked to me about the East End project. I feel that an invitation is coming my way very shortly to go there with the noble Lord. I would be happy to take it up because the project is very interesting and I will want to ensure that my department is aware of it.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08040251000201"></a>I understand the points that he raised about this younger age group. We are looking at the possibility of new arrangements for offenders in custody aged between 18 and 24. They are being piloted following a review of provision for young adults. So we have this issue very much in mind. I am happy to write to the noble Lord and share with him&#151;</p>

I am sure that the problem is that one imagines Titans as those prisons that one sees in the US, with huge towers, machine guns and all the rest of it, but there is no reason why, within a Titan campus&#151;if I can put it like that&#151;smaller units cannot be run with all the advantages of small-scale care management, but with the advantages, too, of the large-scale infrastructure investment that will come. It was clear in our Statement on Carter that building the Titans

He will know that, in the light of Corston, we have started a project that is looking at smaller, local units for women.

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08040251000204"></a>Those aged 18-plus were debated in Committee and last week on our first day on Report. I understand the concern felt about the transfer of young people from youth to adult custodial settings. My understanding is that, since last week, my department and the Youth Justice Board have been discussing a range of transition issues. I shall make sure that our debates are played into those discussions. I fully accept that transition is important and that it is important to ensure that if there are successful programmes&#151;we have heard from the noble Baroness how there can be&#151;their advantage is not lost if a young person transfers into an adult establishment. That point is well taken.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08040251000205"></a>I also take the point about mental health problems. We have discussed them before in relation to adult prisoners, but mental health issues are as debilitating for young offenders as they are for adults. We know that there have been improvements in CAMH services in the National Health Service and we need to take advantage of those. The review by my noble friend Lord Bradley will take these concerns into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08040251000206"></a>There is understandable concern about the use of restraint in juvenile secure settings. We debated the statutory instrument last summer. The debate, which was led by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was very instructive. We announced the independent review of restraint, chaired by Andrew Williamson and Paul Smallridge, and on 20 March, at the request of the two co-chairs, we announced an extension to the deadline for the report. I understand that they will now report their recommendations to Ministers by 20 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08040251000207"></a>The headings mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, may well refer to the sorts of violent acts in which staff may be required to intervene. My noble friend Lord Judd opened his remarks by paying tribute to many of the staff in the current youth custodial settings, which was very handsome of him. When it comes to restraint and other issues, one has to recognise the pressures on staff and the need for intervention. I am sure that we will welcome the report on restraint when it is&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08040251000212"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked me about Oakhill secure training centre. The report by Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons is serious and we have considered it carefully. It undoubtedly reflects very serious problems that the centre faced. I am glad to say that I understand that the centre has stabilised and levels of disruption have reduced. The Youth Justice Board is closely monitoring it and managing the numbers of young people placed in it. It is carefully considering every placement to ensure that young people accommodated at Oakhill are safe and secure. G4S, which is responsible for the centre, has been asked to develop an action plan in relation to the recommendations raised by the inspection. There is no complacency on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08040251000213"></a>A number of noble Lords spoke about the tragedy of death or self-harm in custody. I echo what they said. They will know that the Youth Justice Board has introduced new policies and practices to improve safeguarding and to help to prevent suicide in custody. That involves counselling, support groups and specialised psychological interventions as well as general healthcare and welfare, purposeful activity and the appointment of suicide prevention co-ordinators in all establishments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08040251000214"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, mentioned Section 34 of the Offender Management Act 2007. I have answered a Parliamentary Question on that&#151;at least, it will soon be answered. My understanding is that Section 34, as she said, gave the Secretary of State power to extend the range of types of establishment in which young people serving detention training orders may be accommodated. I understand that the Youth Justice Board is looking at the scope for and practical implications of such an extension. I hope that that gives her the full answer that she called for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08040251000215"></a>Advice has miraculously turned up about the PCC manual. It is not in the public domain because it is an instructors&#146; manual. There is a risk that people might use the information gained in a way that put others at risk. I am happy to respond rather more fully to the noble Baroness on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08040251000216"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendment is most extensive and I congratulate him on his drafting skills. However, there are severe practical problems with its implementation. He proposes that anyone under 20 who receives a custodial sentence should be placed in local authority secure accommodation&#151;a secure children&#146;s home. It would apply to a very wide age range&#151;considerably wider than that of young people who may be tried in a youth court. There would be real concerns, for instance, about placing 19 year-olds and 10 year-olds in the same establishment.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08040251000217"></a>Local authorities are already required to provide secure accommodation, but its volume has declined in recent years. There are currently fewer than 400 places in secure children&#146;s homes in England and Wales. The majority of them are used by the Youth Justice Board to accommodate vulnerable young people who have

It would be impossible to accommodate all under-18s sentenced to custody in local authority secure accommodation, let alone 18 and 19 year-olds, whom the new clause also covers.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08040251000218"></a>All is not lost. My noble friend Lord Adonis, who is sitting beside me, detailed some of the major improvements in the youth justice system in our recent debates on his Bill. I do not want to repeat what my noble friend said in those debates, because many noble Lords took part in that discussion, but it signals an acceptance by the Government and the Youth Justice Board that there are significant challenges in the current estate and that there is more that we need to do.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08040251000219"></a>We need to improve provision, but we should not underestimate the improvements that have taken place since the Youth Justice Board was established. For instance, let us look at some of its current priorities. It is concentrating on getting better provision for 15 and 16 year-old boys, who are more vulnerable; a new unit is being developed at Wetherby YOI. All 15 and 16 year-old girls were moved out of prison accommodation by the end of 2003. Five new special units for 17 year-old girls have been developed within the Prison Service estate but entirely separate from adults and young adults. As I said, there has been the development of joint work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the work of the Youth Justice Board, as well as the development of the <I>Children&#146;s </I><I>Plan</I> and the youth crime action plan. All those are symbols of a determination to meet the challenges that noble Lords have set. If I cannot reply in the affirmative to my noble friend&#146;s amendment, I hope that he will accept that I recognise the concerns that he has expressed.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08040251000220"></a>I pay tribute to people working in the youth custodial setting for the challenges that they face. I understand my noble friend&#146;s frustration, but changes have been made and further improvements will be made. I believe that, at the end of the day, we all share the concern to ensure that these young people are given as much opportunity as possible to be set on the right path for a good life ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08040251000222"></a>I shall pick up several of the points that the Minister made in replying. First, he referred to my humanitarian concern. I hope that I can claim to be part of the widespread culture of humanitarian concern that marks this House and so many of its activities. It has made me very pleased to be a Member of this House, which brings to bear not only learning, expertise and excellence but compassion and concern in a way that sometimes might not be so easy for the other place, with all the pressures of the media operating as they do on the electoral cycle&#151;a point that we should perhaps bear in mind when looking at the future.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08040251000223"></a>The Minister has been at pains to appreciate the service and efforts of some of those who deal with these youngsters. I agree that there are probably many who are to be applauded. I have seen for myself the heroic efforts that can be made and the extraordinary results, such as young people who have been involved in armed robbery going on to hold postgraduate degrees and to make a very positive contribution to society. We should applaud them. The trouble is that they are still the exception. The reality is still stark. It would be quite wrong to go over all the statistics again, but they are there, such as the fact that 80 per cent of young offenders under 18 reoffend within two years. That is not a success story, although there are successes, and we must take that seriously.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08040251000224"></a>The Minister&#151;this is not the only occasion on which he has done this&#151;also talked about the determination to see proper services and support arrangements in place. I am sure that he will agree that much of the best research that has been done in this area shows that, if progress is to be made with the young, it will be made in small units. The ability to provide real relationships within small units is crucial to success. After all, when we dealt with the Minister&#146;s own amendment earlier this afternoon, we touched on the fact that we must look to the needs of the young people concerned. He will have noticed that I was at pains to point out that what I liked about his amendment was that it did not talk about children in generalised terms; it talked about the offender. That was an important point to underline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08040251000225"></a>I tremble when I hear about the vast new prisons that are marching completely in the opposite direction from what the research indicates is necessary for the young. My noble friend has said that he does not believe that it would be possible to provide alternative accommodation of the kind for which I argue on a comprehensive basis. However, he has not answered the point: if some other countries can do it, why are we not able to? I do not understand.</p>

<a name="80402-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08040251000226"></a>I am a firm supporter of the Government, although sometimes they might ask when. In that context, we like to say how basically strong the economy is, despite some temporary interruptions from time to time. It does not quite tie up if we claim that we are one of the strongest economies in the world but then say that we cannot afford to do what other countries that do not have such economies can do. That seems to say something about priorities. I have touched on that before, but the balance of expenditure is a contentious issue. Galbraith spoke about,</p>

I should like to give notice on how I might combine my concerns in this context with those of noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and his real anxiety to see how the situation can be improved in the immediate future. If the noble Lord will permit me, I should like to talk with him on how we might combine our efforts in that respect. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08040251000231"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we have arrived, by way of this amendment, at building safeguards yet again as pertains to custody for children. Noble Lords will be forgiven if they felt a sense of d&#233;j  vu or familiarity in many of the arguments as they related to Amendment No. 44. Amendment No. 45 would create a statutory custody threshold that must be met before any child is sentenced to custody to ensure that children are locked up only as a last resort and for reasons of public protection, save where mandatory custodial sentences apply.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08040251000232"></a>We acknowledge the Minister&#146;s concerns about children who have committed grave crimes and would support a custody threshold that relates only to offences other  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than murder and the serious crimes listed in Sections 226 and 228 of the Criminal Justice Act. A distinct custody threshold for children and young people was introduced by Parliament more than 25 years ago. It resulted in a 54 per cent decrease over nearly a decade in the number of under-21s given a custodial sentence for indictable offences.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08040251000233"></a>In the year ending March 2007, the Youth Justice Board spent &#163;280 million on custody for children, notwithstanding the cost of support in the community for these children and their families. The board now has a target, approved by the Home Office, to reduce the number of children in custody by 10 per cent by 2008. Yet the number of children in custody has risen, not fallen. The amendment is therefore in complete conformity with the stated aim.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08040251000234"></a>I was interested to hear the Minister&#146;s numbers for children being received into prison in the debate we have just had. He went slightly too fast for me, so I wonder if the numbers I have match with what he said. Nevertheless, let me repeat them. The number of children aged between 15 and 17 being received into prisons under an immediate custodial sentence has increased from 4,918 in 2003 to 5,219 in 2006, an increase of  13 per cent. This does not take into account receptions into secure training centres and local authority secure children&#146;s homes. Contrary to what the Minister said earlier, there has been a reduction of 22 per cent for all prison receptions, adults and children, raising concerns that children are disproportionately being given immediate custodial sentences.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08040251000235"></a>The Minister has argued that a custody threshold already exists in the form of Section 152(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. We would argue that it is inadequate because it does not meet our obligations in international human rights law, again something that has been much talked about today. The obligation is that children be treated in a recognisably different way from adults. Custody for children should be used only as a last resort, but we would go further and say that the wording of Section 152(2), which emphasises the seriousness of the offence as the factor to be considered, is meaningless without reference to a person&#146;s age. That is the object of our amendment.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08040251000236"></a>The Minister might also argue that that these safeguards would put the public at significant risk, but Ministry of Justice figures up to December 2007 show that the vast majority of children aged between 15 and 17, some 78 per cent, who were sentenced to imprisonment in 2006 were not convicted of offences related to sexual crimes or violence against the person. More than one in 10 children&#151;14 per cent&#151;were imprisoned for theft and handling; 5 per cent for motoring offences and 4 per cent for drug offences. A quarter of children were imprisoned for other offences that included affray, criminal damage and even drunkenness. Then there are well known cases such as the Deerbolt Two where custodial sentences were passed on children for graffiti offences.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08040251000237"></a>We know that custody does not rehabilitate the vast majority of children, and much has already been said about that. Three-quarters of these children reoffend within a year. This amendment would enable

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08040251000238"></a>Finally, the Children&#146;s Plan, published in December 2007, promises that the Government are taking,</p>
<ul><a name="08040251000316"></a>&#147;a fundamental look at the way in which the criminal justice system overall is working for young people to ensure that we learn from existing good practice and address current concerns. This includes examining what we know about why young people offend, what a more effective approach to prevention would look like, [and] the options available for dealing with children who commit crimes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000258"></a>So there clearly is an intention on the part of the Government to take a comprehensive look at this area in the round. This amendment would provide them with the means of meeting some of those objectives.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08040251000239"></a>Organisations working with children in the criminal justice system and those concerned with the protection of human rights are united in urging a considerable reduction in the number of children held in custody. The general public want more effective intervention and less imprisonment. The Local Government Association has agreed that it is time we,</p>
<ul><a name="08040251000317"></a>&#147;explored more effective and sustainable ways of dealing with children in trouble, rather than resorting to&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08040251000259"></a>locking them up. This amendment provides the Government with a way to do that. I beg to move.</p>

The same thing might apply to an elderly man. Psychological harm might not become apparent immediately but take several months, or even years, to manifest itself. Even &#147;serious physical harm&#148; requires some greater definition. Supposing that same burglar were to punch the householder in the face, breaking her nose or knocking out a tooth. Does that count as serious or mild harm? I simply do not know. The noble Baroness may well have an answer to that.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08040251000241"></a>The second flaw is the extremely high hurdle required by this amendment to send someone dangerous in some respect to prison. Not only do they have to have committed an offence, but the possibility of them committing another one must be imminent. If, for some reason, they go abroad and are not in a position to commit another offence in this country for six months, there is no imminent risk of an offence; they are not likely to commit an offence immediately. So it must be demonstrable and imminent. I do not know quite how you can demonstrate that they are likely to offend immediately, in a few days or weeks. Perhaps the noble Baroness will be kind enough to clarify exactly what that means.</p>

I am also concerned that paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed new Section 152A(1) are cumulative, so that you must have both aspects in order for a custodial sentence to be passed.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08040264000002"></a>On a slightly different aspect that worries me very much, many adults with serious mental health problems find themselves in prison because there are not hospitals appropriate to take them. There are therefore people locked up in prison as a place of last resort, although the problems that led them to commit their crimes are due to their mental health rather than solely to their criminality. I do not know&#151;I ask the Minister&#151;how many children and young people are in prison because there is nowhere else to send them and they are not safe to leave in the community.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08040264000003"></a>I had some experience in my previous life of trying to find places for young people who were not actually going before the criminal courts, although they should have been there in one sense; although they had committed offences, we caught them before it was necessary to take them there. I remember one 15 year-old who was extremely dangerous. It was difficult to find a place for him to go. I recall opening a place for young psychiatrically disturbed people under the age of 18 in Newcastle about 15 years ago. It added another 20 places to the eight places at that time catering for these mental health problems. That provided 28 places only for the whole country.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08040264000004"></a>There will be people who need to be locked up, but they do not need to be locked up in prison. What are the Government providing by way of psychiatric places in a hospital that devotes one wing to young people, or therapeutic communities where the young people can be helped?</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08040264000005"></a>The other group that I remember well was at Peper Harrow, which is now Childhood First; that community had to close down because people would not pay to send people there. The Caldecott community has a number of young people who otherwise might very well be in prison. The therapeutic community is an enormously valuable asset for those who do not actually have to be locked up as dangerous but who, if they were not in the therapeutic community, would either have committed suicide or be in a psychiatric hospital, if one could find one. We need more mental health places for young people as the alternative to putting them in prison.</p>

We have debated a great deal the damage that is done to children who are placed in custody, but we have talked about it in general terms of principle.

I would like to see in the amendment a more graduated approach to the restrictions, particularly bearing in mind that the Bill introduces the youth rehabilitation order, which gives the court a great deal more flexibility. By saying that, I would not in any way like the noble Baroness to think that I thought that her drafting efforts  were in vain.</p>

It is amply able to determine whether,</p>
<ul><a name="08040264000105"></a>&#147;the offence committed caused or could reasonably have been expected to cause serious physical or psychological harm&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000082"></a>and that it,</p>

<p><a name="08040264000083"></a>Those are issues that sentencers customarily have to resolve. The purpose of introducing this threshold is to show that only where physical or psychological harm is occasioned to members of the public, and there is a risk of it continuing, should custody be used in respect of a person under the age of 18. From these Benches, we are trying to rebalance the system so that custody is not seen as an appropriate sentence for minor or major dishonesties, fraud or whatever, for those who are under the age of 18, but should be reserved for where there is serious physical or psychological harm, or the threat of it.</p>

Indeed, any emphasis in the law that underscores and endorses the principle that incarceration should be the very last resort in relation to a young person, and even more so for a child, obviously has massive merit. I accept that the wording of the amendment is such as to give rise to undue restrictions; most certainly it could not possibly be contemplated in the form in which it now exists.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08040264000010"></a>I want to make a point that arises from the remarks made by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It relates to the very high percentage of children and young persons who are suffering from mental conditions, some of which are very serious. The situation is so serious that one could well ask this question: is society treating those persons as if they were criminals with only a mental health overlay when in fact the situation is the very opposite and is basically a mental health problem with a criminal overlay? Anything that can bring about a change in that culture of thinking would be extremely beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08040264000012"></a>In replying on the last amendment, my noble friend said that those of us advocating it were on the side of humanitarian concern. We are proud to be so, but it really is not just about humanitarian concern&#151;that is part of the exasperation that arises. It is about being effective in protecting society, because what is being done at the moment does not protect society. That is the point. What is the tough way to protect society and what is not? Here there is a complete coincidence between what makes enlightened humanitarian concern and what is effective at achieving results.</p>

In a sense, it is a practical expansion of the overriding debate about youth justice, its purposes and the place of custody within it. Again, this has been an extremely interesting debate, in which there is very little difference between noble Lords on intent, the purposes of custody, the fact that custody should be the last resort and the rehabilitation provisions that we wish to see within any custodial setting.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08040264000014"></a>The Government share some of the practical concerns about the amendment. I will write to noble Lords on the figures, because I know that they are of great interest. Overall, my understanding is that the number of under-18s in custody has remained relatively stable over the past seven years. The proportion of under-18s given custody as a proportion of all under-18 disposals has actually fallen from about 4 per cent to 3 per cent. It is an indication&#151;I do not say any more than that&#151;that there has been a greater use of out-of-court disposals. We seek to increase the availability of out-of-court disposals in the future, and the Bill contains such provisions.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08040264000015"></a>The problem that we have with the amendment is that it would set a much higher custody threshold for under-18s than at present. The noble Baroness wants to do that, so this is really a question of judgment rather than the technicality of the amendment, although there are some technical issues. I understand why she wants to set a high custody threshold; she thinks that the actions of the courts and the provisions in custody do not sufficiently meet the needs of those young people. I understand that, but we are concerned about the practical implications. As the House will be aware, and indeed as the noble Baroness said, in most cases a court may impose custody under Section 152(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 only if it considers that the offence and any associated offences are so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08040264000016"></a>The amendments that I moved last week, which your Lordships spoke on, will mean that the courts will have to consider specifically whether a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance or intensive fostering could be used. If the court considers that they are not sufficient, it will have to say why. Our amendment reflected our previous discussion. The Government have recognised that and have moved considerably on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08040264000017"></a>The first limb of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment relates to the seriousness of the offences. The second goes on to provide that, even where serious physical harm has been caused, the court cannot impose custody unless it is necessary to protect the public from a demonstrable and imminent risk of serious physical or psychological harm. The problem that we have is that we think that that would place severe restrictions on the court and undermine our obligation to protect the public. It could mean that a person could commit an offence involving the deliberate infliction of serious bodily injury but the courts would have no power to impose custody unless the prosecution could prove beyond reasonable doubt that custody was necessary to avoid the future risk of serious physical or psychological harm. We heard from the noble Lord, Lord Monson, among others, of some of the problems in meeting that requirement.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08040264000018"></a>We have debated at great length and with enthusiasm the question of judicial discretion and we will be doing so again later today&#151;we tend to pray it in aid of whatever argument we seek to put forward&#151;but I would be very cautious about accepting this amendment, as it would unnecessarily fetter the discretion of the judiciary.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08040264000019"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and then the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, spoke about mental health problems suffered by young people in custody. I think that they were making two points: there could be some young people in custody because there is no provision in the health service and there are other young people in custody who ought to be under the care of appropriate health service provision. During the passage of the Metal Health Bill through your Lordships&#146; House in the previous Session, we debated many of these points as they applied to adults. There is clear evidence in the prison system of people with severe mental health problems who ought to be in secure NHS facilities. That is recognised. I pay tribute to the Prison Service and the health service for the substantive improvements that have taken place, but more needs to be done. The report of my noble friend Lord Bradley, which we eagerly await, will cover those matters, as it will in relation to young people. I am not at all complacent on this point. It is a well recognised matter.</p>

<a name="80402-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08040264000020"></a>Last week, I think, we discussed the development of child and adolescent mental health services, which have been expanded by the National Health Service. That is a great comfort. In addition, the provision of NHS secure forensic mental health units has been expanded. In 2002 there were only two units, with a total of 28 beds, in Manchester and Newcastle. The NHS National Commissioning Group&#151;which I think I once had responsibility for&#151;has ensured greater capacity and better geographical distribution, with units opening in Birmingham, south London and west London over the past three years. Another unit opening in Southampton in 2008 will bring the total number of units to six. I also understand that from April 2007 a further 10 secure mental health beds specifically for young people with a learning disability have been commissioned from St Andrew&#146;s Hospital in Northampton, with seven more planned

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08040264000021"></a>Let me be clear: in all our activities, we are seeking to reduce the number of young offenders coming into court and to provide the courts with robust alternatives to custody. We share the analysis of so many noble Lords as to why that should be necessary, but in certain circumstances custody will be necessary. In those circumstances the judiciary should retain the discretion that it now has. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which is very well intended, would fetter that discretion too much.</p>

The Minister is right that we have a fundamental difference of approach and he is right in interpreting my motivations in this area. We believe that there are still too many children&#151;the emphasis is on children&#151;going into custody who should not be incarcerated by the state. The state has a particular duty in this regard, because children should be treated differently from adults. International human rights law, which we have signed up to, says that in terms. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its report in January 2008, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08040264000107"></a>&#147;the provision in the Criminal Justice Act restricting the use of custody is a general restriction applying to all offenders, rather than one aimed at ensuring that custody is only ever used as a genuinely last resort in relation to juveniles. In our view, a much more specific safeguard is required in order to ensure that the obligation in Article 37(b)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000084"></a>of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08040264000023"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that, in addition to what my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford said about courts having to use discretion and judgment on a regular basis, the custody threshold, such as it exists in Section 152(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, has as its factor for consideration the seriousness of the offence. We argue that that is also a discretionary judgment and that the threshold itself is meaningless without it. Here we have tried, by bringing in a person&#146;s age and circumstances, to help to elucidate the circumstances that might affect that person appearing before the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08040264000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was good enough to say that we confront Section 37 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, with which, he said, the law began to go wrong. I was interested to discover that the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, who was in his place earlier today, said about the provision in the then Bill, at Second Reading in December 1997:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="08040264000098"></a>&#147;As far as I can tell, creation of a general duty is an innovation not to be found in other parts of the system of criminal justice. While it sounds desirable enough in principle, there may be difficulties in reconciling it with international treaty obligations on the rights of the child and there will be an awkward question to be faced as to whether or not it should extend to defence counsel in criminal proceedings. But they are good intentions and good intentions often have practical consequences which must then be faced and resolved in some way that is regarded as satisfactory to the legislature&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/12/97; col. 569.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000032"></a>There have been practical problems. In my earlier remarks, I outlined how the provisions in the  1998 Act has been overtaken by later legislation that has incorporated our duties and responsibilities under international treaties.</p>

It is a principle that should not simply be confined to the court&#146;s sentencing and the purposes of the court in sentencing, to which Clause 9 refers. It should be a principle that applies across the board to every agency, whether it is the police, prison officers, youth

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08040264000044"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment was thoroughly debated in Committee. Therefore, I can be reasonably telegraphic in introducing it again at Report. Clause 10 proposes that suspended sentences cannot be ordered for summary offences heard in magistrates&#146; courts. The Government&#146;s argument for advancing that is that if the option to issue a suspended sentence is denied the court, it will impose a community sentence, thereby assisting the Government in their well known difficulties with prison overcrowding.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08040264000045"></a>In our view, the inference is illusory. When one is dealing with a suspended prison sentence, as your Lordships know, one is dealing with an offence that has passed the custody threshold. This follows from guidance issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, as I indicated in Committee. At page 24 of the guidance, the Sentencing Guidelines Council sets out the questions that the court should ask itself. First, has the custody threshold been passed? Secondly, if so, is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be imposed? Thirdly, if so, can that sentence be suspended? Thus, if a court concludes that a custodial sentence should be imposed and if the option of a suspended sentence is removed, as the Government so intend, prison is inevitable. Removing the power of magistrates to use suspended sentences for summary offences would have the opposite effect to that intended by the Government: it would increase the prison population, not reduce it. I beg to move.</p>

That is a laudable objective, but I have the gravest doubts about whether that can be achieved by the risk that the Government are taking with regard to this provision. Indeed, in all likelihood it will have the opposite effect. I referred in Committee and I will do so again to what happened in the Home Office 40 years ago when I was a junior Minister,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which rather dates one. A careful analysis was carried out of the effect of suspended sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 1967 after the Act had been in force for 12 months or so. The objective of the Act, among many other things, was to try to reduce the number of prison sentences.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08040264000050"></a>The figures were something like this. The number of prison sentences remained exactly the same. The number of fines fell by about 18,000. The number of suspended sentences was about 18,000. In other words, one could never prognosticate nor indeed have any confidence in exactly how courts, particularly magistrates&#146; courts, will react to such a situation. That is in no way pejorative of magistrates&#146; courts. There are petty sessional divisions that are apparently very similar socially but that have entirely different sentencing policies. There is therefore every likelihood that the ironic consequence of this provision will be to increase the prison population rather than reduce it.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08040264000051"></a>There is one other reason why this clause should not be allowed to proceed. There is real merit in having the power to suspend for relatively innocuous offences, or let us say offences that are not of the highest rank of seriousness. Like so many other sentencers, I have often looked at a person&#146;s antecedents and seen how he or she was dealt with most leniently four, six or eight times before, and then seen a chasm where a very serious sentence had suddenly to be imposed. One often wonders what would have happened to that person if a shot across the bows by way of a suspended sentence had been fired much earlier in their criminal career.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08040264000052"></a>As for the logic of the situation, much as I respect the normally unremitting and perfect logic of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I think that one might make this distinction. In so far as there is reference to crossing the threshold of custody and whether the case merits imprisonment, that is a decision for a sentencing court. Of course the decision whether one suspends a sentence is a decision for the sentencing court by definition; but actually it is a sentencing court sitting as a parole board. It has already sent the person to prison in its mind, and then one second later it reconstitutes itself as a parole board and asks whether it is necessary for that sentence to be served. I think that there is that justification for what might seem a matter of rather slick mental gymnastics.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08040264000053"></a>I simply ask the Minister&#151;who has been most accommodating on all the points raised on the Bill&#151;to consider that the Government might be wrong on this matter and that an unnecessary risk is being run.</p>

I declare an interest as a magistrate for 25 years. I also apologise to the House because I was not able to take part in Committee on this matter. I promise that I will not make a Committee speech. I agree with the comments made. One point which perhaps has not been made is that the provision removes discretion from the magistrates&#146; court. It chips away at an institution that has served the British legal and judicial system very well over the years. The fact is that the suspended sentence is an extremely valuable sentence. I remember that it was in disfavour

It is a sword of Damocles hanging over someone to ensure that they do not step out of line. It is an absolutely perfect way of administering justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08040264000055"></a>Like all noble Lords who have spoken so far, I think that the provision will have the reverse effect. If magistrates are unable to impose a suspended sentence they will look for another disposal. It should not be assumed that it will automatically be a community order or fine; it may well be a custodial order. I therefore invite the House to support the amendment.</p>

<ul><a name="08040264000110"></a>&#147;has not been sufficiently robust yet to show that it is SSOs that have, or will have, a significant impact on the prison population. On the contrary, it may well be that an SSO impacts less on the prison and probation services and resources than either an immediate custodial sentence or a high level community order with a greater number of requirements&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80402-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08040264000057"></a>In the course of these debates we have all expressed our admiration for the magistrates and our belief in the importance of not fettering unnecessarily the discretion of the judiciary&#151;to use a phrase used only an hour ago by the Minister. Surely it is very important to remember that the Magistrates&#146; Association has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="08040264000101"></a>&#147;We can see no logical or good reason for this proposal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08040264000088"></a>Surely that must cause the Government to think again.</p>

I am concerned that there are not enough resources to provide enough community sentences. We have been talking about more and more being put in. To suggest this on top of everything else seems impractical, because I very much doubt that the resources will be available to do as the clause seeks.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="08040264000059"></a><b><a name="80402-0008.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="80402-0008.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="08040264000571"></a>Lord Bach:</b></b> My Lords, let me do my best. To start off with, I remind noble Lords that we are seeking in Clause 10 to remove the rights for summary offences to be dealt with by suspended sentence orders; we are not for a moment trying to remove the right to use suspended sentence orders for either-way offences, let alone indictable offences. We are talking about summary offences only. Let me make clear our premise. The courts are in practice using the new suspended sentence&#151;which came in on 1 April 2005&#151;for substantial numbers of summary cases which would previously have received non-custodial sentences. The courts have made substantial use of the orders since their introduction. There has, however, been no commensurate drop in the use of the immediate custodial sentence. Suspended sentences are therefore not being imposed instead of immediate custody.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1092"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1092</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08040264000060"></a>Let me go through the figures. Comparison of the confirmed sentencing figures for all courts for 2006, after the legislation came in, and those for 2004, before it came in, show that the immediate custody rate has remained stable at just under 7 per cent, whereas the usage of suspended sentences has increased from 0.2 per cent in 2004 to 2.4 per cent in 2006. The number of suspended supervision orders has increased from 2,900 to 33,500, 12,700 of which were for summary offences as against 700 in 2004. The figures for the magistrates&#146; courts alone may be even more significant. A comparison of 2004 and 2006 shows that the immediate custody rate has remained stable at 4 per cent whereas the usage of suspended sentences has increased from 0.1 per cent in 2004 to 1.7 per cent in 2006. The actual numbers increased from 1,300 to 23,300. Some 12,400 of that number were for summary offences, as against 700 in 2004 before the Act came into force. For summary offences sentenced in the magistrates&#146; courts alone there was a slight drop in the immediate custody rate, from 2.1 per cent to 1.9 per cent. However, the rate of use of suspended sentences shows a much greater increase of 0.1 per cent, to 1.1 per cent.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08040264000061"></a>As I said, we do not believe that that is due to a change in the seriousness of offences. The only explanation offered in Committee was that there had somehow been a sudden increase in the seriousness of offences so that the number of suspended sentences shot up even though the number of those going to prison remained the same. We are not aware of any evidence that there has been a sudden change in the seriousness of offences. It seems to us very unlikely that such a change would coincide exactly with the availability of the new suspended sentence. It also seems implausible that any such increase in seriousness would coincide so exactly with the availability of the new suspended sentence. In fact, use of immediate custody for summary-only offences in the magistrates&#146; courts has been fairly stable at around 2 per cent for the last 10 years, up to and including 2006, which would appear to argue against an increase in seriousness in recent years.</p>

<a name="80402-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08040264000062"></a>The implausibility is twofold. First, it seems implausible that an increase in seriousness has occurred specifically to coincide with the introduction of the new suspended sentence. Secondly, it seems implausible that such an increase would manifest itself by moving offences from community disposals to suspended sentence orders, but that no significant proportion of offences would justify a move up to immediate custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08040264000063"></a>Those who support the amendment have to say what explanation there can be for these figures&#151;which are unchallenged, as I understand it&#151;other than our explanation, which is that these sentences have been used, not altogether but largely, in place of what would otherwise have been community orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08040264000064"></a>We believe it is very much more likely that magistrates have not maintained the previous custody threshold. It is one thing to say that magistrates should go through a simple logical process whereby they simply label an offence as being one side or another of the custodial threshold, in complete isolation from consideration of the sentencing options. I intend no disrespect to any court, let alone magistrates&#146; courts,

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08040264000065"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said on 15 November 2007:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="08040264000102"></a>&#147;The seriousness of the offence determines whether it crosses what is known as the &#145;custody threshold&#146;, but factors personal to the offender can justify the court in passing a non-custodial sentence even where the custodial threshold is crossed. In practice there is quite a wide border-line area where it is open to the court to choose between sending the offender to prison or dealing with him in some other way. This is particularly true in the case of Magistrates&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000089"></a>I think that was the point that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, was making.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08040264000066"></a>A suspended sentence, intuitively, is different from an immediate custodial sentence where the offender has no opportunity to avoid the clanging of the gates&#151;prison. Introducing a freely available suspended sentence, which was intended to be a useful tool to the courts as an alternative to custody, has in fact&#151;I maintain that the figures show this&#151;had the unforeseen effect of blurring the level of the custodial threshold.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08040264000067"></a>But in any event, if the suspended sentence is no longer available for summary offences, courts will impose an immediate custodial sentence only in those cases where they are clear that they have no alternative, and in other cases they will use community disposals. Under these circumstances we believe that the custodial threshold is likely to revert to something close to its previous level.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08040264000068"></a>To support the case that I am putting, I pray in aid the fact that the chief executive of NACRO, Paul Cavadino, agreed precisely with the point that I just made. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, was a director of NACRO for many years. It is a very well respected organisation. In other words, Paul Cavadino should know what is happening. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="08040264000103"></a>&#147;Restricting suspended sentences to more serious offences should help to avoid the &#145;boomerang&#146; effect of these sentences which is boosting the prison population. This happens when courts pass suspended prison sentences on offenders who would not otherwise have been jailed and then activate them on top of a new penalty if the offender returns to court&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000090"></a>Not all suspended sentences are successful, if that is not already obvious. When a suspended sentence is given, in as many as 30 per cent of cases the offender, alas, offends again and is then liable to a longer period of imprisonment for his original offence and for the new offence.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08040264000069"></a>In a newsletter of May 2007 the Sentencing Guidelines Council said that the number of suspended sentences rose steadily between 2004 and 2005, that provisional figures for 2006 show a much more rapid increase and that the information available to the council and the panel appears to indicate that this increase has been accompanied more&#151;I stress &#147;more&#148;&#151;by a reduction in the number of community orders than in the number of custodial sentences. Therefore, having seen the operation of this new change, the Sentencing Guidelines Council

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08040264000070"></a>I have spoken to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and told him that I wished to quote from his Second Reading speech. He is a most distinguished Member of your Lordships' House who has gained great expertise in this field over many years. I stress that he was speaking from the Back Benches when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="08040264000104"></a>&#147;The Bill provides for the restriction of suspended sentences to indictable offences and those that can be tried either way. There is evidence that courts too often pass suspended sentences where they could have passed a community sentence. Even where courts use the suspended sentence properly to replace an immediate jail sentence, they often fix suspended periods of imprisonment longer than the immediate prison sentence that they would otherwise have passed. If the criminal reoffends and the sentence is activated, the offender is imprisoned for longer than if he had received an immediate prison sentence in the first place. Let us hope that the Bill will at least limit this damage by prohibiting the passing of suspended sentences for minor summary offences&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/01/08; col. 163.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040264000091"></a>It is only that which the Government seek to do&#151;to prohibit the passing of suspended sentences for minor, summary offences.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08040264000071"></a>If there is concern about the supervision aspect, I should say that all conditions that can be imposed under a suspended sentence can be imposed under a community order without adverse effect on the prison population. It is our firm belief that if we do not introduce Clause 10, the courts will continue to impose suspended sentence orders where they would previously have used community orders. The results of that, ultimately, would be that around 400 people&#151;I want to be very careful with figures here because there is no way of proving the point as I am referring to the future rather than the past&#151;would end up in prison who would not be there if we remove the suspended sentence for summary-only offences. I have spoken for some time but this is a serious matter. I ask the noble Lord to consider withdrawing the amendment&#151;</p>

If not, how can the Government say that they do not trust magistrates as regards suspended sentences yet trust them as regards custodial sentences?

That is exactly the way that the noble Lord himself used to pass suspended sentences. But if the consequence of suspended sentences is that people come back in large proportions and have to be sent to prison&#151;that is what should happen if a suspended sentence is broken&#151;the problem is that the prison sentence increases, rather than decreases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08040264000075"></a>I am advised that the magistrates have already received strong advice in sentencing guidelines. That has been pointed out. The statute is clear. But the figures, I am afraid, speak for themselves, and unless there is a better explanation of those figures&#151;and no one has come up with one yet&#151;it would seem that this particular reform of 2003 has not worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08040264000077"></a>The Government can reasonably be accused in a phrase that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has often used&#151;&#147;order, counter-order, disorder&#148;. The Government have only recently introduced these changes. They have decided after a very short period that the changes are not working and to reverse rules that they made only a few years ago. Quite apart from the uncertainty of the statistics, the very least that your Lordships&#146; House can ask of the Government is to give the present system a chance to see whether it could work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08040264000078"></a>Perhaps I may say, with enormous respect to the noble Lord, that some of the observations that he made about the conduct of magistrates in their courts are rather unfair. Magistrates are bound by the sentencing guidelines. They have to follow them. The sentencing guidelines are crystal clear about the circumstances in which suspended sentences can be applied. Is he suggesting that magistrates are now breaking those rules for some reason? I am sure that he is not, or I am sure that he did not intend to suggest that. The case for our position is quite irrefutable and for those reasons I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08040268000008"></a>As we all know, the current situation in prisons is such that it is simply not possible to initiate rehabilitation schemes which meet the requirements of the law. As a result, there is growing frustration among prisoners who have received IPPs about their inability to have the opportunity to improve their lot. The problem is now deeply ingrained in all the associated difficulties of prison resources. Indeed, at the end of the Committee stage debate, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, raised a very interesting question about the compatibility of the current state of prisons with the European Convention on Human Rights. His second point was that, if someone is awarded an IPP, what goes with it is a right to be rehabilitated. If that right is in practice, as he put it, a fiction, is that a denial of someone&#146;s human rights under the convention? That question was posed at the end of Committee and I should be most interested to know whether the Minister has managed to reflect on it between then and now.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08040268000009"></a>Perhaps I may introduce this matter again very briefly, because we had a long debate about it in Committee. As your Lordships are very well aware, the conditions for imposing an IPP are that, first, the crime must be one of 153 specified sexual or violent offences; secondly, the offence must be capable of attracting a sentence of 10 or more years of imprisonment; and, thirdly, the offender must pose a significant risk of causing death or serious injury by the commission of further offences. In such cases, the judge must impose an IPP and the offender must serve a minimum tariff before he can be considered for release; but, as I have already indicated, he can be held in custody for as long as he is considered to pose a threat to public security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08040268000010"></a>The most recent figures indicate that at least half of all sentences given for threats to kill, child sex offences and sexual assault resulted in a tariff of less than two years. That means that, if the Government press ahead with their plans, those individuals will not be eligible for IPPs, given that their sentence length would be below the threshold that is to be introduced. I quite understand the convenience to the Government of seeking to legislate in that way, but judges sentence individuals to IPPs because they believe that they are dangerous. The assessment of danger is quite independent of the length of the sentence of imprisonment that judges give for the offence charged. They are not connected but are completely different exercises.</p>

<a name="80402-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08040268000011"></a>Desirable though it may be to relieve the pressures of the IPP system, it should not be done by undermining the assessment of a judge that a particular person should receive an IPP because he represents a real threat. I repeat, the judge has to undertake two completely different exercises. On the one hand, there is the sentencing exercise and, on the other, the assessment of whether the individual is capable of being a threat to society. This is what we complain of. Whether the tariff is below or above two years, the judge faces exactly the same problem in either case. I beg to move.</p>

If one leaves out proposed new subsection (3B)&#151;the lines which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests should be omitted&#151;an indeterminate sentence could be imposed only where an offender has previously committed a very serious offence such as murder or rape, as set out in Schedule 6. There are 22 very serious offences as distinct from the 153 offences set out in the other schedule. The amendment would reduce the number of those for whom an indeterminate sentence would be available. That is my view of the effect of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment and I gather that it is shared by the Government.

This amendment came from another place; another place has looked at the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and at the Minister's letter, and the view is retained that the amendment achieves what it sets out to do. I know that that is not the Government&#146;s view but it is the view that I must sustain at the Dispatch Box.</p>

In doing so, perhaps I could also address Amendments Nos. 57 and 58, under other clauses, which relate to extended sentences. It will save time if I deal with them together because they relate to the same point. The noble Lord knows the arguments which I wish to advance, so I can be brief.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08040268000020"></a>Everyone accepts that it is the duty of the Government to protect the public, in so far as the public can be protected, from very dangerous offenders. That was the purpose of Section 225 of the 2003 Act. However, the Government now accept that the provisions in Section 225 of the 2003 Act have misfired. Mr David Hanson in the other place accepts that the provision no longer serves what he described as a proper purpose. It is not serving a proper purpose because it catches offenders who ought not to be caught; it is catching criminals who are guilty of quite minor offences of violence and yet are being made subject to indefinite sentences of imprisonment. As my noble friend Lady Stern said, it is catching children and subjecting them to indefinite sentences of imprisonment.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08040268000021"></a>As a consequence, there will soon be some 5,000 offenders serving indefinite sentences, which is far in excess of what was ever anticipated. The number is increasing at the rate of 1,800 a year, and it is estimated by the Home Office that it will exceed 12,000 by 2011. With a population of prisoners now estimated to exceed 85,000 by this time next year&#151;the answer which the noble Lord gave in reply to my noble friend on Monday&#151;it is quite clear that something has to be done urgently to inhibit any further increase in the number of those serving indeterminate sentences. That is the view of the Chief Inspector of Prisons in her recent report and the view of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles. Happily, the Government have accepted that view and, as a result, Clause 30 will give judges a discretion whether to impose an indeterminate sentence or not. The word now is &#147;may&#148;&#151;not &#147;must&#148;. That is clearly a step in the right direction, for which we must all be grateful. Moreover, under Clause 13, indeterminate sentences will be available only where the tariff is two years or more, which is another step in the right direction. But it goes nothing like far enough to make any difference to the present problem of overcrowding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08040268000022"></a>If we are to stop overcrowding getting worse, let alone reduce the present level of overcrowding, the indeterminate sentence must be reserved now for really serious offenders; in other words, those with tariffs of four years or more. And that is the purpose of my amendment. It will be said no doubt that whether one chooses two years or four is a matter of judgment. That is of course true, but the judgment should be based on facts and not on political expediency. The crucial fact here is the remorseless increase in the prison population.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08040268000023"></a>The indeterminate sentence is also a cause of great injustice. Those who have served their tariff sentence remain in prison indefinitely in the hope that they will in due course come before the Parole Board, but the Parole Board is already overstretched and its position will become a great deal worse during the coming year. That there are people in prison who are waiting to go before the Parole Board and who have served their tariff sentence is a possible cause of unrest in prisons.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08040268000024"></a>There are two reasons for supporting the amendment. In the first place, we can do something now about overcrowding and prevent a situation which is already bad getting worse. Secondly, we can do something to remedy a source of serious injustice to those who are serving these sentences.</p>

I also support the further amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for the reasons which he gave. I was dismayed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggest that there was no correlation between the sentence of imprisonment for an offence and the degree of danger. I find it improbable that somebody who was given a sentence of 28 days, which I understand was in one case given with an indeterminate sentence, was really so dangerous that they had to be kept in prison indefinitely, but their offence was so minor that it resulted in only 28 days. I understand that a considerable number of sentences have been very much less than one year. All of that leads me to think that the system as it has been working&#151;and as I understand the Conservative Benches would wish it to work from the way in which they interpret their amendment&#151;would allow 28 days to continue in the future, which is profoundly wrong. I strongly support the Government, but even more so the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick.</p>

The key word in all this is surely &#147;risk&#148;. There is no doubt that there are some people who go to prison who are such a risk to the public that their release must always be a matter for conjecture. If you talk to prison governors about the people who give them most concern, they invariably refer to paedophiles and sex offenders, for whom there is always going to be a doubt about whether they will be fit for return to society, not least because, tragically, many of them have an ambivalent view about what they have done, having themselves been victims. But that is not the subject of this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08040268000027"></a>We are clearing up yet another example of a knee-jerk introduction in the 2003 Act which was not subject to proper regulatory impact assessment. Although the introduction was right, the impact on the Prison Service has been disastrous, with vast numbers of people awaiting courses in order to be released. The impact has been disastrous, too, on the Parole Board, and it is only going to get worse. Therefore, while I entirely support the principle, it seems to me that what needs to be done is for us to look at what the impact of the proposed increase to four or seven years is assessed to be, but also at the impact on the Prison Service and Parole Board to see whether they can deliver what needs to be delivered to make the thing work. The whole system becomes discredited if it cannot do what it imposes in its Bills.</p>

There is every reason why the House should support the amendments. The Government are to be congratulated on their attitude to the relevant provisions of the Act of 2003. It is very proper that the matter should be left to general judicial discretion rather than be made mandatory. On the other hand, I say with the greatest respect that the Government are failing to be loyal to their own logic in setting a threshold that is much too low.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08040268000029"></a>It is obvious that there is a relationship between the initial sentence threshold and the risk. When a court is considering the risk, it should ask what the best evidence is. The best evidence is the offence with which it is dealing: it is what the man has done. Therefore, for all those reasons, the amendment should receive the wholehearted support of the House.</p>

I asked the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, what he thought about his own amendment, in a sense, because, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, suggested, and I said in Committee, we think that it would not achieve what he seeks, and would restrict IPPs in a way which he would not want. I think that there is general agreement about that.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08040268000033"></a>Clause 13 amends Section 225 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by setting out two new conditions, one of which must be met before the court can impose an IPP. One of those conditions is the two-year threshold; the other is a previous conviction for one of the shortlist of extremely serious offences set out in new Schedule 15A to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which can be found in Schedule 5 to this Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1103"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08040268000034"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would remove entirely the threshold condition, in new subsection (3B), without making any further consequential amendment. It leaves the other condition intact. Our reading of it is that it leaves a statute whereby a court may impose an IPP where only the first condition is met; that is, that the offender must have a previous conviction for one of the shortlist of extremely serious offences set out in new Schedule 15A.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08040268000035"></a>A substantial number of IPPs have been given out by the courts. It was certainly not foreseen by the Government that high numbers of IPPs would be given with very short tariffs. I said in Committee that about 30 per cent of offenders receive a tariff of two years or less. The average tariff for all IPP sentences is 38 months and, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, the shortest tariff recorded so far is just 28 days. That clearly raises serious questions about whether the sentences can provide an appropriate degree of risk management for those offenders who have received only a very short tariff.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08040268000036"></a>On a practical level, as a number of noble Lords have already observed, such sentences can create great management difficulties. I do not need to go into great detail, but they present an enormous challenge to the service, which is a matter of considerable concern to noble Lords. Prison staff are under instructions to prioritise indeterminate sentence prisoners with short tariffs and to move them as quickly as possible to establishments where their offending behaviour needs can be addressed so that they can go through the structure and their case can then be considered appropriately by the Parole Board. We have also increased provision. The number of core offending behaviour courses has risen from 14,000 in 2004-05 to 18,000 in 2006-07, and additional funding has been given for the implementation of offender management in prisons.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08040268000037"></a>However, welcome as those improved measures are, they are clearly not enough to deal with the problem that we face. That is why we are proposing that the statute be changed to ensure that courts are able to make more targeted use of the sentences. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested that the seriousness of the trigger offence bore no relation to the degree of risk presented by the offender. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, responded in vigorous terms that I can only endorse. We think there is an association between the assessment of an offence and the risk of future offending and causing future harm, which is reflected in the sentence, although it is but one factor in the risk assessment undertaken in the courts.</p>

<a name="80402-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08040268000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill. IPPs per se have not been held incompatible with the ECHR. We certified that they were compatible on introducing the 2003 Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, may have had in mind the judgment in the Divisional Court in the case of Walker and James that the Secretary of State for Justice had acted irrationally in failing to provide the necessary resources to support the delivery of offending behaviour programmes for IPP prisoners

The Court of Appeal upheld that judgment&#151;I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, knew that&#151;and made a declaratory statement. It also indicated that if an IPP prisoner were held in custody for an unreasonably long time after a tariff that was not defined by the court, he would have a case for a judicial review  under Articles 51 and 54 of the ECHR. Walker and James did not receive the remedy of release as they were not considered to have exceeded their tariff by an unreasonable time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08040268000039"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised the question of risk, I shall point out that there is an exception to the seriousness threshold where offenders have previous convictions for certain very serious offences. We believe that in certain cases it may be advisable to impose a public protection sentence even though the threshold has not been reached for the current offence. Those cases are where an offender has already demonstrated that he or she is capable of very serious crimes. The relevant offences are those that invoke the &#147;two strikes&#148; or &#147;automatic life&#148; provision of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, which was incorporated in 2005 into the dangerous offenders legislation. The list includes soliciting and conspiring to commit murder, manslaughter, grievous bodily harm with intent, robbery with firearm, and possession of firearm with criminal intent. The sexual offences covered are rape, rape of a child, and other offences involving very serious sexual activity without consent. These additional sexual offences were introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. I should also make it clear that public protection sentences are not the only risk-management tool that protects the public from sexual and violent offenders. We believe that there is sufficient discretion and that the courts will still be able to give IPPs where they are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08040268000040"></a>I listened with great care to the speech the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, made on his amendment. He welcomed the changes that the Government have put down, but would prefer to go further in the way that his amendment suggests. Rather like the debate on the custody threshold in relation to youth justice, it is a question of judgment whether the Government have this right or whether the noble and learned Lord has. He met my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor to discuss this, which was very helpful, but after careful consideration we think that the minimum two years in custody is the most appropriate threshold because it equates to a headline sentence of four years. We do not think that is an inevitable sentence. It would be unusual to receive a four-year sentence for a trivial offence. We are trying to strike a balance between ruling out cases that are not serious enough to be considered in this light and allowing the court to detain worrying offenders, even if their immediate offence is not so serious as to deserve an extremely weighty sentence.

Of course, we are now talking about a different system, but my reflection of the previous regime shows that four years with two years&#146; actual custody was considered a threshold beyond which risk management came more into play, which is one of the rationales for the period that the Government have chosen.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, feels we have gone too far. I happily put the proposition that maybe we have the balance right.

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08040274000004"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am grateful for this opportunity to start a discussion in your Lordships&#146; House about the environmental and health benefits of cycling.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08040274000005"></a>A large number of noble Lords cycle to, from or around here. I feel privileged to be followed by my noble friend Lord Young, who is a real professional cyclist. I believe he cycles from John O&#146;Groats to Land&#146;s End and back in a couple of days or so. He is very impressive, and I am greatly looking forward to hearing what he has to say. I just cycle for business and a bit of pleasure, and I find it is a good way of getting around. I must present the apologies of the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, who is another great cyclist from your Lordships&#146; House. He has had a knee operation today to enable him to cycle better and, although he has been to the House, he has only just recovered from a general anaesthetic, so it is probably a good thing that he does not try to speak. I declare an interest as secretary of the All-Party Group on Cycling. We have our annual parliamentary bike ride on 10 June.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08040274000006"></a>Before I launch into what a great thing cycling can be, I congratulate the Minister on the Government&#146;s recent announcement. It is probably worth putting to bed something that comes up every time we have a debate on cycling: the vexed question of cyclists not obeying road signs or wearing lights. We must clearly deprecate any failure to obey the law. I certainly try to obey the law. That is not, however, a reason for knocking everything cycling, which one or two people occasionally do.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08040274000007"></a>I shall give a few facts and figures about the benefits of cycling, particularly to health and the environment. If one thinks about the number of car journeys under that most people make, an awful lot of them could be done on a bicycle. Sixty per cent of car trips are less than five miles, which can be done very quickly on a bicycle. Cycling is very good for you; I certainly feel fitter when I cycle. The Chief Medical Officer has said that adult cyclists can be as fit as someone 10 years younger and have a life expectancy of two years above the average. It is a good way to start thinking about cycling if you can behave as if you are 10 years younger and have an extra couple of years of life.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08040274000008"></a>There is, however, a ridiculous fluctuation in the number of people who cycle in different countries and different cities in Europe generally or in the UK. Apparently, only 2.8 per cent of commuters in this  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1108"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country cycle. In the Netherlands, it is 27 per cent. The Netherlands is fairly flat, but so is much of England. The difference is that the Netherlands has provision for cyclists that makes one feel safe. I shall return to the question of safety and fear, because fear is a serious disincentive. The UK has two major initiatives. One is from the Mayor of London, whose target to increase cycling by 80 per cent was reached in 2000, five years before the deadline. Cycling around London, one sees that there is still a variation in provision between boroughs, but, my goodness, it is a lot better than it was 10 years ago. There is safety in numbers in cycling. When there are 25 of you trying to get across Hyde Park Corner rather than just one, you feel a lot better and safer, even with the lights.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08040274000009"></a>Nationally&#151;I am sure my noble friend will tell us more about this&#151;the Government have increased the funding for cycling to &#163;140 million in the next three years, which is fantastic. Again, there is a terrible variation in provision between some local authorities. I believe that some of them spend only about a &#163;1 a head on cycling, whereas &#163;5 to &#163;10 a head is spent in the Netherlands, Germany and, I suspect, in Denmark. It may interest noble Lords to know that Copenhagen&#151;I have seen a lovely report about cycling in Copenhagen&#151;is going to increase cycling by 10 per cent, which will reduce the years of prolonged severe illness by 46,000, save &#163;5.5 million annually and reduce the number of sick days overall by more than 3 per cent. That is worth having. Copenhagen claims that this will mean an extra 61,000 years of life&#151;I am not sure what that means individually, but it is still pretty good&#151;and will save 80,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. This is all at a cost of about &#163;15 million, which is a tenth of what the Government are putting into cycling for the whole country. It is not unachievable and is of the same order of magnitude as the campaign that I am sure my noble friend will tell us about.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08040274000010"></a>The Copenhagen initiative is a campaign to make cyclists feel safer. There will be more cycle tracks and all the usual things as well as better behaviour, which is not a bad thing at all. The key, however, is to make the cyclist feel safer, which I shall focus on for a bit. I certainly find that fear is a great disincentive to cycling&#151;my wife finds it even more so&#151;and I am afraid that that is largely due to the speed of the traffic on the road that you are on and the distance from that traffic that you are forced to be. If you have a cycle lane, that is absolutely fine. If not, a 15 mile an hour speed limit is wonderful. A 30 mile an hour speed limit is probably better. When the speed limit gets up to 40 and 50 miles an hour, one thinks seriously about going on the road at all and tries to find a footpath. You are much more likely to get killed if you are hit by a car going faster. Cars have less room for manoeuvre, even if they are concentrating.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08040274000011"></a>There is a lack of good design in many cycling facilities. The worst cycling facility that I have come across is somewhere in Belgravia, where Westminster City Council has put in a chicane, especially for cyclists, with lovely granite kerbs. You have to slow to about 5 miles an hour even when there is a green light. Why bother? The council has clearly not thought about the design at all. The other point about design  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1109"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is that we really must look at journeys holistically. It is fine having a great cycle lane when you want to go across London, but if you cannot get across Hyde Park Corner&#151;which is a bad example because you can get across most places quite well now&#151;you are not going to do it. There must be a proper and consistent series of cycle routes. There is largely such a series in London, but not in many other places.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08040274000012"></a>To return to the point about speed limits, the  20 mile an hour zones in Hull, which are one example of good practice, have resulted in a 90 per cent reduction in the number of those killed and seriously injured. Residents also like a 20 mile an hour speed limit. I know that not all motorists like it, but a network of roads in the city with a 20 mile an hour speed limit should be encouraged.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08040274000013"></a>Lastly, I make a plea to the Minister. Lorries are bigger than cars, and their size makes them particularly dangerous for cyclists, especially when they turn left. We have had a lot of publicity about this recently. I do not like longer and heavier lorries, and I hope that the Minister can give me some comfort that the Government are not about to introduce them. However, March 2009 is the European Commission deadline for fixing safety mirrors on lorries so that drivers have a chance to see all around their lorry, especially the side that they are not driving on. Will the Government require them to be fitted retrospectively? If not, we would be in trouble and the blind side of the lorry would be a serious problem for cyclists.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08040274000014"></a>In conclusion, I hope that the Government will look at road use holistically when they are getting others to spend this &#163;140 million, which is really welcome. There are great gains for the environment and health, but I still worry about the fear factor which can be mitigated by design and speed. Unlike car and lorry drivers, cyclists are not protected. As a number of officials and Ministers have done already, I hope that the Government will continue to look at best practice in Copenhagen, Amsterdam or wherever. The potential for increasing the proportion of people who cycle is enormous and the more of us who cycle, the safer we feel as a bunch. There is a bit of a herd instinct.</p>

I declare an interest in that I am a keen cyclist. I would not describe myself as a professional cyclist, which would be taking it a bit too far. For me, 2004 was a special year. I entered this House and I also cycled from Land&#146;s End to John O&#146;Groats with a friend. We did 1,012 miles in 21 days, which was not the most direct route and certainly was not done in the fastest time. But it was a great way to experience the state of the roads and to test how integrated the transport system is as a whole. We also experienced the good, the bad and the ugly of British bed-and-breakfast accommodation and the joys of the Youth Hostel Association. Last year, we toured  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Western Isles and I occasionally cycle to the House from my home in Southall, a distance of 12 miles through busy, London traffic. I bring to this debate current experience of what it is like to cycle all  over the UK.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08040274000016"></a>Some cyclists&#151;it was in the news recently&#151;have a reputation for going through red lights and even for cycling down one-way streets, and some cycle recklessly on pavements. Clearly that is not acceptable behaviour, but we need to get it into perspective. It is rare for pedestrians to be injured or killed by cyclists. However, when cycling, the behaviour of many drivers leaves a lot to be desired. They have a desperate desire to overtake anything and everything, whatever the circumstances. They will drive frighteningly near cyclists, which adds to the climate of anxiety to which my noble friend Lord Berkeley referred. Being in a cycle lane, which is just a painted area of the road, does not afford the cyclist much protection.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08040274000017"></a>The state of the roads is another disincentive to cycling. More and more one finds significantly large potholes. Cyclists need to look ahead, because if they do not it is not just the wheel of their bike that will be bent, it will be a part of their anatomy as well. Sometimes potholes are left unrepaired not just for months but for more than a year. It is important for the Minister to encourage local authorities to understand that cyclists need a safe environment, and that includes the state of the roads.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08040274000018"></a>Many more people might consider cycling to work or taking their bike on holiday if they could use the train, but facilities are minimal. If trying to organise taking your bike on a train, you will have to plan a long time in advance. The facilities are minimal. If using your bike for work, it is at risk of vandalism or theft if you have to leave it at a station without lock-up facilities.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08040274000019"></a>I welcome the Department for Transport report, <I>A Sustainable Future for Cycling</I>, which was published in January. I have not had the chance to read it perhaps as closely as I would like, but, if it has a gap, I did not notice a reference to an integrated transport approach, which we need on cycling. It is no good looking at cycling on its own. It should be part of an integrated approach to transport. As my noble friend Lord Berkeley said, I, too, welcome the three-year budget of &#163;140 million for Cycling England. There are some interesting elements in the programme. For example, the report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="08040274000147"></a>&#147;500,000 Year 6 children (10 year olds) will be to take part in a Bikeability cycle training by 2012, equipping them to cycle safely and responsibly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000133"></a>It is really good to encourage the next generation of young cyclists to cycle safely and responsibly on the road.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08040274000020"></a>The infrastructure programme will deliver 250 additional links to schools. Up to 11 new demonstration areas and six demonstration towns will have their own projects to encourage cycling in towns. These are really good developments. <I>A Sustainable Future for </I><I>Cycling</I><I></I>also states that the infrastructure programme will also deliver:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="08040274000148"></a>&#147;Doubling the number of &#145;cycling to school&#146; champions from 20 to around 40 who [will work] with schools&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="08040274000135"></a>Many people may think that &#163;140 million is quite a lot of money for what they consider to be a niche area. But if we look at the cost-benefit ratio, for every &#163;1 spent on the programme, the Government expect benefits of &#163;3.20, which is a good return on the investment.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08040274000021"></a>If one asks the average person his or her perception of how safe it is to cycle on the roads these days, given the increase in traffic, I think that most people would feel that it is less safe. Interestingly, statistics give a different story. It does not mean that there is any room for complacency, but, while it is true that cyclists are more at risk of being killed or seriously injured than motorists&#151;a rather obvious statement&#151;the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured in 2006 was 35 per cent lower than the 1994-98 average.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08040274000022"></a>It is important to make drivers more aware of cyclists. Very often cyclists feel that drivers do not care or are blissfully ignorant of people on two wheels using the road. I welcome the fact that driver testing and training has been improved to encourage more awareness of vulnerable road users. How much of that is incorporated in the driving test, I am not sure. </p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08040274000023"></a><I>A Sustainable Future for Cycling </I>makes a valid point when it states that cyclists also need,</p>
<ul><a name="08040274000161"></a>&#147;to take steps to reduce the likelihood or consequences of an accident by wearing high visibility clothing and cycle helmets&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000136"></a>I must admit that too often I see the &#147;near invisible cyclist&#148; at night. They have no lights and dark clothing, and clearly have a bit of a death wish. Educating cyclists is as important as educating motorists.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08040274000024"></a>The CTC, the cyclists&#146; touring club, has suggested that 20 miles per hour should be the default urban speed limit. I have no doubt that motorists would see that as a severe attack on their liberty. It is interesting that the CTC states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="08040274000150"></a>&#147;20 mph zones in Hull have resulted in 90% falls in killed and seriously injured from collisions. 20 mph limits are strongly supported by residents and evidence from Germany indicates that they result in an increase in walking and cycling&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000137"></a>The Government should seriously consider that.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08040274000025"></a>The CTC also proposes that we should:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="08040274000151"></a>&#147;&#145;Health check&#146; every transport and land use decision. Ensuring that houses and services are planned to minimise travel and maximise access by walking and cycling has a major contribution to public health&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000138"></a>So the Government should promote walking and cycling as a key part of their plans.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08040274000026"></a>If we have to assess the contribution of the Government, overall they are doing a good job of promoting the benefits of cycling, but in terms of whether we yet have a truly integrated transport that sees road, rail and cycling as a whole, I am not convinced. I will welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on that. Again, I thank my noble friend Lord Berkeley for giving us this opportunity.</p>

I have been a cyclist for many years and I am very enthusiastic about it. I feel quite strongly about the value and benefit of cycling. On the question of health, I agree entirely with my noble friend. Fitness, exercise and well-being are wonderful benefits of cycling. An important point to make about cycling is that you can do it until late in life. Cycling is intergenerational and can be done for an awfully long time. I welcome the fact that even though, dare I say it, I am now in my mid-70s, I can still cycle regularly. I hope that the knee problems of the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, are not caused by cycling. I have always considered that one of the advantages of cycling is that it is much easier on your knees and ankles than running or other sports. It is very important that you can cycle until late in life.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08040274000028"></a>The advantages for the environment, about which both my noble friends spoke, are obvious. The problem is, of course, how to get more people cycling. In urban areas the answer is to make it safer and speedier. I congratulate Sustrans, the CTC and some local authorities on their work to provide safer routes to school, to work, to the railway and bus stations and to the shops. However, the lanes have to be properly designated. They need to be more than just white lines painted on the road. Even little bits of rubber nailed into the road surface so that drivers know that they have strayed into the cycle lane when they feel a bump, as exist in Paris, would be a great help.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08040274000029"></a>To make cycling safer and quicker, the cycle lanes have to be continuous. My noble friend Lord Berkeley talked about the cycle lanes in London, many of which are good, but the trouble is that some of them end when you get to a difficult junction, which is the very time when you need a dedicated lane. This is what makes people cycle on the footpath, go against a red light or ride down a one-way street&#151;not that I have ever done those things, of course.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08040274000030"></a>We ought to give some sort of priority to cyclists or reduce road speeds. One of the pleasures of cycling in Belgium, Holland or Denmark is that motorists give priority to cyclists. There are teeth-like marks on the road and motorists stop to give priority to cyclists. That is one reason why many more people cycle in those countries. That sort of culture would be a big help. Moreover, people are not tempted to go against the <I>Highway Code</I>.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08040274000031"></a>I agree with my noble friend that we need an integrated system, an important element of which is being able to book your bike on to the train. Some railway companies provide a booking service, but many do not. Every May bank holiday I go with a small group of elderly people on a trip to France. We take the ferry from Dover, but to get to and return from the port we have to take the car. We do that because a whole group of cyclists may come off the boat and take up the few spaces available on the train. You could be stuck in Dover with your bicycle for a day or two because there are only three or four bike places on each train. A group of, say, boy scouts would take up all the spaces and you are then stuck. Indeed, that once happened to us. We have to take the

If people could book their bikes on to the trains, that problem would be avoided. It is an important point about integrated cycling.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08040274000032"></a>I welcome the investments into and the promotion of cycling being undertaken by the Government. I have gone over my time, so I shall sit down. I see that the Whip is very pleased at that.</p>

I have been cycling all my life, but more particularly for the past nine years since I was diagnosed with diabetes. At the time I was three stone overweight and I was told that I had to do something about the way I conducted my life. I have done that and kept my weight down, mostly thanks to cycling.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08040274000034"></a>I cycle in London whenever I can. I come in in the mornings&#151;this shows what we leisurely Peers who do not have to go to offices do in the mornings. I also come in on my motorcycle, which may be of interest to noble Lords. According to the newspapers, the two enemies on the roads are motorcyclists and bicyclists. I do not see that. I ride a motorcycle and a bicycle and the greatest problem, apart from the lorries&#151;despite the mirrors, which I understand in many cases have been provided free&#151;are pedestrians in London. Pedestrians, whether natives or tourists, seem to look with puzzlement at pedestrian lights, and there is a certain aggression. The other night I cycled down a street in Piccadilly with the lights in my favour, but the pedestrians were streaming across the road. I threaded my way through them carefully but I was called all kinds of names beginning with B and C, which I would not repeat in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08040274000035"></a>Speaking personally on the health aspect, I can say that for someone with my condition cycling is probably the very best exercise. Every six months I go for a check-up with my diabetes specialist. He has told me that I am the only one of his patients who cycles regularly, which is because of the fear factor that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, described. My doctor said that he would cycle to his clinic in Marylebone High Street if he felt that he could arrive safely. He has also said that I am more likely to die cheerfully as a result of falling off my bicycle than by succumbing to the effects of diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p>

<a name="80402-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08040274000036"></a>I am very careful on my bicycle and I have to say that I am pretty horrified at the standard of riding demonstrated by most other cyclists. I do not often see the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who rides with great skill and speed. He even has special gears fitted on his Brompton folding bicycle so that he can move rapidly down Birdcage Walk or wherever he is going. I have a standard machine which I put in my car when I go away. Like the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, I travel to France; when I do, I put the bike in the back of the car, as I did last year when I went to the San Sebastian film festival. San Sebastian, besides hosting a lovely film festival, is a remarkable place. It was the pioneer city in Spain for cycle lanes. Quite apart from being

The way in which cyclists are treated by all other road users is exemplary. When you come back to London, you are back in the jungle again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08040274000037"></a>The Government could do various things. It is all very well having a policy, but you have to have the political will to make the policy work. Cycling is very good for families. A lot of young people today are overweight or even obese, so parents would like to get their children on to bicycles. At the weekends in London&#151;it is a curious thing&#151;in lots of areas the cycle lanes are full of parked cars. This is the fear factor again: why would you take out two small children in a crocodile on your bicycle at the weekend or on a summer&#146;s evening when you must negotiate cars and vans parked in the cycle lanes? I am quite sure that the Minister would tell us that that is all to do with law enforcement and that the law is there to stop that happening. Well, why does that not happen? The cycle lane situation in London is pretty strange and illogical anyway. For example, on Chelsea Bridge, which I frequently go over, bicycles can go one way on the footway on the edge of the bridge, but they cannot go the other way. If you attempt to do so, as I have done from time to time, not only are you likely to be stopped, but you meet angry ladies walking their dogs saying that you ought to know better. That is a disagreeable experience for sensitive parliamentarians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08040274000038"></a>In the investigations that I carried out before speaking tonight into opinions around the House, particularly those of my colleagues, I thought of two cyclists. My noble friend Lord Taverne is still cycling; I would put him forward as a candidate for one of the best preserved and most athletic Members of your Lordships&#146; House for his age. He cycles every day and included cycling in his 2005 book&#151;I admit that I have not read it&#151;<I>The March of Unreason</I>, which is available in paperback. There is an examination in it of the benefits to your health set against the dangers of cycling within metropolitan London. Despite all the things that we are saying, it came out in favour of the benefits by a ratio of 10:1. I think that the Government can help us to increase that ratio. The book describes the cycle, rather amusingly, as,</p>
<ul><a name="08040274000162"></a>&#147;a green car that runs on tap water and toasted teacakes and has a built-in gym&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000139"></a>If that whets the appetite of noble Lords who want to find my noble friend Lord Taverne&#146;s book, I daresay that it is in the Library; they will be cheered by what they read.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08040274000039"></a>Various other aspects of cycling that create problems for cyclists have already been mentioned, such as the business of theft, of course. You almost write down your bike because you know that it will be stolen if you are not careful. If you leave a folding bicycle&#151;such as a Brompton, as is owned by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and me&#151;outside for two minutes you are at risk, so you carry it into shops with you. You carry it everywhere. People are very understanding about that, although it is often a bit of a squash in a small tobacconist&#146;s where you are looking for the <I>MotorCycle News</I>, which is often what I am doing. But you have to do it, otherwise you run that risk. They are expensive items to replace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08040274000040"></a>The success of the French system is amazing. I was in Paris during the rugby cup and saw at close quarters how their pool system, which started in Lyon, works. You pick up a bike on a card system where the first half-hour is free and you pay &#8364;7 for each subsequent hour or two hours. It is not cheap, but the bikes are very high quality; I examined them closely. They are now used widely. The system also means that people, visitors and locals, use these bicycles on a regular basis. Some of them are not very experienced and they wander around the roads in a way that would shock experienced cyclists in your Lordships&#146; House. To motorists it is a salutary lesson: you must give cyclists a wide berth. In any case, there are draconian sanctions in France against cars that are seen to be a menace to cyclists. If you hit a cyclist, you can get your collar felt, to use the vernacular. That does not exist here. There is definitely room for improvement. The contrast with Europe must be looked at; we have many lessons to learn.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08040274000041"></a>The main points for the Government&#151;and I would be interested in the Minister&#146;s remarks when he replies&#151;are that we must alter the law to give more protection to cyclists from vehicles of all kinds if we want to support the Government&#146;s excellent initiative. We must revisit the design of cycle lanes and see whether they are logical. We must improve them where possible. We must deal with the potholes, which the noble Lord, Lord Young, has described; they are an absolute menace and a disgrace. I would not expect to find them in Entebbe or Dar es Salaam. I never rode a bicycle in those places, but many of the roads here are shocking.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08040274000042"></a>Will the Government think of devising a promotion scheme to back up their policy which explains the benefits of cycling clearly and positively, whether in leaflets or posters? It should not cost too much. Will they also stress cyclists&#146; responsibility for the consideration that they get from other motorists? It is terrifying that any cyclist should go out without lights at night. He is putting at risk not only himself but other people who are driving cars and other vehicles. He may be in a position of facing homicide charges. That is utter selfishness and should be dealt with harshly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08040274000043"></a>I am over my time but, before I sit down, let me say that nobody has mentioned bells. I do not have one, but now that I have reminded myself I will go out and get one. In London, we ought to encourage cyclists to use a bell, so that they can shift these pedestrians out of the way before you arrive and they abuse you. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for giving me a chance to speak on this subject. I could not get in on a Question the other day; the matter has been remedied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08040274000045"></a>We have heard some of the evidence for the health benefits of cycling. They are impressive. We know that greater physical activity is directly linked to the prevention of a range of chronic diseases, including heart disease and stroke. On heart disease, it would appear that the older the participant, the greater the benefit. So, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, rightly said, it is never too late to start.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08040274000046"></a>Eight years ago, a study was published in Denmark involving thousands of cyclists. It showed that even after adjusting for other risk factors, those who did not cycle to work had a 39 per cent higher mortality rate than those who did. A study in Germany five years ago looked at the effect of cycling on breast cancer in pre-menopausal women and found a direct correlation between amounts of cycling activity and lower risk. Those cyclists who commute, say, for a 30-minute journey each way, are fulfilling the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s recommendation for daily exercise. You burn calories, you lose weight and you feel better.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08040274000047"></a>There has been a mass of studies about the benefits that would ensue to the nation if more people were to cycle regularly. Cycling England has translated those benefits into money terms. The savings to the NHS and the savings to traffic congestion amount to hundreds of millions. It has done similar calculations on the benefits to the environment. A 20 per cent increase in cycle journeys could mean 54 million fewer car journeys, which would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 35,000 tonnes. That is a worthwhile prize in anyone&#146;s terms. The prize is proving elusive. In the national cycle strategy published in 1996, the previous Conservative Government made a rather bold pledge; to double the number of bicycle trips by the end of 2002 and to quadruple the number of trips by the end of 2012. Not only has this not begun to happen, but in 2005 the Government conceded in their White Paper that it was not going to happen and that the original target could not be achieved. How could they tell? It was easy enough, because the statistics were actually moving backwards.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08040274000048"></a>The frustrating part is that the present Government came to office and did many of the things that they needed to do to give cycling a real boost. They endorsed the previous Government&#146;s strategy, and they put in train some good initiatives at local authority level which, with a bit of a push from Ministers, should have gathered speed. But, somehow, the momentum was lost. That could not be more unfortunate in view of the public health imperative. We have a state of affairs in England, as noble Lords have referred to, in which almost a quarter of the population is obese and where rates of diabetes, to name but one serious medical condition, which has already been mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, look set to reach unparalleled levels over the next 10 years unless people start living healthier lifestyles.</p>

<p><a name="08040274000142"></a>which was in the White Paper. Despite all that, rates of cycling have actually fallen from where they were a decade ago by about a fifth and stand at just 1 per cent of all journeys. The number of 11 to 15 year-olds cycling to school has also gone down very considerably in the past 10 to 12 years. How the Government have allowed that dismal situation to come about is not particularly difficult to diagnose; they took their eye off the ball. They did not manage to hold local authorities properly to account for delivering on the targets. The ball was picked up again in 2005, when Cycling England was created and when Sir Ron Eddington was asked to carry out his transport study, which contained a number of useful conclusions for cycling policy. But even today, progress around the country, with the signal exception of London, has been very limited indeed.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08040274000050"></a>That is not to say that it was ever going to be easy. When my noble friend Lady Chalker was transport Minister in the 1980s, she made the profound observation that the best encouragement that we could give to cycling would be to make it safer. There is no doubt, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said, that worries about road safety are a major reason why people do not use their bikes for commuting and other short journeys and why parents will not let their children cycle to school. Although the number of non-fatal casualties has gone down by about a third over the past 10 years, the number of fatalities has been rising since 2003, despite the background of fewer cycle journeys. We are still talking about more than 16,000 cyclists a year being involved in road accidents; but it does not have to be like that. The experience in London over the past few years shows that, with a bit of careful investment, the accident rate can actually come down, even when the amount of cycling goes up; as it has done quite dramatically. Someone writing in the <I>New Yorker</I> magazine described cycling in the city as, &#147;anarchy without malice&#148;. There may well be a bit of anarchy around, but it does not seem to be responsible for much of the road casualty figures.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08040274000051"></a>The other main barrier to progress is perhaps less easy to overcome. There is an inherent problem with cycling; it is not exactly &#147;cool&#148;. It will probably not be seen as cool until we have role models who promote it in a way that resonates with those disadvantaged groups in society who most need to get on their bikes. At the moment it is the relatively affluent and educated sections of society who cycle, and we need to get the message to those at the opposite end of the social spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08040274000052"></a>Earlier this year Ruth Kelly announced a really welcome boost for cycling in the form of a grant of &#163;140 million to Cycling England over the next three years. That decision gives me cause to hope that, after all, the Government have not entirely given up on the target set by the previous Conservative Government. But money like this needs to be properly targeted if it is to achieve its purpose. How is it likely to be spent, what achievement from it may we hope to see and over what timescale?</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08040274000053"></a>Perhaps I could put one or two ideas to the Minister as a small contribution to his deliberations. Cycling England and other bodies all agree that the  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>best benefits to health, as distinct from all the other benefits, come from persuading older people to cycle. One way to do that could be to promote the use of electric bicycles. Unfortunately, however, there is a problem with electric bicycles. I wonder whether the Minister is aware that the present law is seen as being confusing and somewhat arbitrary because it would appear to include some electric bikes within the definition of &#147;bicycle&#148; but not others. Would he consider clarifying the law so that all electric bicycles, including the so-called &#147;twist and go&#148; variety, are classified as bicycles and not as motor vehicles?</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08040274000054"></a>My second proposal is one that the Government could consider encouraging among local authorities. As noble Lords have said, cycling could play a major role in our efforts to reduce traffic congestion, particularly in some of our larger towns and cities. Has the Minister considered copying some of the best practice on the Continent, such as the V&#233;lib initiative in Paris? I understand that there are now more than 700 pick-up and drop-off points where bicycles can be rented free for the first half-hour and for very little thereafter, and then can be dropped off at any of the other points in the city. It is one of the initiatives that my honourable friend Mr Johnson has promised to introduce, should he be elected as Mayor of London, but it is clear that it is an idea that could be rolled out in other cities.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08040274000055"></a>I hope that after a decade of disappointment we will now start to experience the fruits of the Government&#146;s renewed good intentions in a way that HG Wells would have approved of, and that both our environment and the health of the nation will be the joint beneficiaries.</p>

I congratulate not only the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who is a keen advocate of cycling, but all those who have taken part. We do not spend enough time talking about issues such as this. That reflects that it has been neglected&#151;not by the Government, I hasten to add, but more generally&#151;to acknowledge and celebrate the merits of cycling in our culture. It is only a generation ago that probably most people cycled to work, to their factory or their office.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08040274000057"></a>I grew up in the flatlands of Essex and cycled every day, and so did those I grew up with. It was part of how you were. Much as we talk now about the contribution that cycling can make to reducing our carbon footprint and tackling the obesity timebomb, my generation did not see it that way at all&#151;we just thought it was a fun thing to do. Acquiring the skills of cycling was part of growing up.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08040274000058"></a>I assure the House and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that the Government are fully signed up to appreciating and promoting the health and environmental benefits of cycling. Indeed, our support for and funding of Cycling England, which has its own appointed experts in health and environment on its board, in 2005 to assist in formulating programmes to give life further life to a cycling strategy is clear evidence of that. In  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>October 2007 the Government published <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System</I>, which responds both to the Eddington study on the transport contribution to improving economic growth and productivity and to the Stern review on reducing carbon emissions. Meeting the transport needs of a modern economy while delivering those important CO2 reductions is a challenge, but not an insuperable one. Cycling is an important alternative to the car and one of the key low-carbon transport options we will need to employ in meeting the climate change challenge.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08040274000059"></a>On top of that, as all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate have observed, there is the challenge of the obesity timebomb that the Foresight report highlighted. That has been responded to by the <I>Healthy Weight, Healthy </I><I>Lives</I> cross-government strategy for England. It is clear that cycling can offer a significant contribution to addressing all these challenges and, through government departments working together and recognising our shared objectives, we have already started to deliver on the plans set out in <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System.</I></p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08040274000060"></a>In January this year, we awarded a record &#163;140 million to Cycling England after considering its already notable achievements and upon the evidence in a report by the economic consultants SQW on <I>Valuing the Benefits of Cycling</I>. This provided evidence of a 3:1 benefit, much of which relates to health and the environment. The noble Lord, Lord Young, observed the benefit of that cost-benefit ratio in those terms. The six-fold increase in Cycling England&#146;s budget is further evidence of the Government fully understanding and accepting the case put forward by Cycling England and others interested in promoting greener travel options. As part of a joined-up approach, the Department of Health is contributing &#163;15 million towards cycling, demonstrating its recognition of what cycling can do to improve the health of the nation.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08040274000061"></a>So what are we planning to do with the additional funding? That is the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The first aim is to give children an opportunity at an early age to set a blueprint for life. These primarily have to be good health and a recognition of the importance of the environment. With Cycling England, we have pledged to give an additional 500,000 schoolchildren the opportunity to undertake high-standard on-road cycle training, to address some of the issues that the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, drew attention to, of core practice among cyclists. We have agreed also to provide 250 additional links to schools, connecting 500 schools via traffic-calmed or traffic-free routes, in addition to the 295 links already provided to over 600 schools since 2005. We have also agreed to double the number of &#147;cycling to school champions&#148; to work with around 400 schools, to maximise the benefits of these combined programmes. We are therefore giving the next generation the skills to improve their health and providing improved infrastructure to ease parents&#146; understandable fears over allowing their children to cycle to school. It will also give children greater independence while at the same time reducing the need to ferry children around by car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08040274000062"></a>Cycling England announced in February &#163;47 million to extend the Cycling Demonstration Towns programme, including creating the first large cycling city. Existing demonstration towns such as Darlington, where the numbers of those cycling to school has quadrupled, and Aylesbury, where the number of people saying that they are using a bike as one of their main modes of transport has risen from 3 per cent to 14 per cent, demonstrate to all what local authorities can achieve. This investment will provide around 3 million people with levels of spend on cycling seen only in the very best European cycling cities.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08040274000063"></a>The assessment criteria for the new demonstration areas includes the requirement for local authorities to show how their bids contribute to the aims of the <I>Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives</I> strategy and to think strategically across all departmental remits, such as environment, transport, education and health, and most importantly to show high level leadership and commitment. Cycling England, together with the Department of Health, are already working with two primary care trusts in Nottingham and Northamptonshire in the Community Health Improvement programme. By working with staff and those most at risk to poor health, such as the middle-aged and deprived communities, through cycle training and cycle rides they will be able to demonstrate to other care trusts what can be achieved.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08040274000064"></a>Cycling England also published <I>Cycling </I><I>and</I><I> Health</I> in 2007 and distributed it to local authorities and primary care trusts, which provides all the evidence in one document, with some practical ideas on how the two can work together. It does not end there. We have given Cycling England a remit and funding to find new solutions to encourage adults and at risk groups to cycle more, particularly for the journey to work and through leisure.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08040274000065"></a>On the topic of the journey to work, the Department published guidance on the Cycle to Work scheme in 2005 and at the same time negotiated a group consumer credit licence to ease the burden upon business in setting up the scheme. Since then, around 100,000 people have participated.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08040274000066"></a>In addition to our work with Cycling England, our successful initiative Sustainable Travel Towns is entering its final year of a five-year project and has so far seen a 10 per cent reduction in car trips and around a 30 per cent increase in cycling. That is on a target population of more than 180,000 people. The main tool used to achieve that is personalised travel planning, and I would like to point out this is not a &#147;nanny state&#148; intervention on how people should travel, but provides tailored information to enable people to make voluntary alternative travel choices to the car.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08040274000067"></a>A trial in one of the towns, Peterborough, showed that in a three-mile rush hour trip into the city centre, the cyclist took 15 minutes, had free parking and took some exercise burning off around 200 calories, while the car driver took 22 minutes, had to pay for parking let alone fuel and running costs and of course had no exercise. Providing that kind of tailored information can motivate people to make cycling the preferred option, especially in an urban environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08040274000068"></a>We recognise that we must improve cycling facilities in order to tempt more people to take this option. We are doing precisely that through Cycling England's free advice service to local authorities on the design of cycling facilities and through guidance such as the <I>Manual for Streets</I>, which promotes the highest priority to be given to pedestrians and cyclists in the design of residential streets.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08040274000069"></a>Finally, the Government implemented the local transport plan process in 2000 to enable local authorities the opportunity to develop their transport priorities and recognise that we share some, such as reducing congestion and improving air quality. Through that process we have asked local authorities to develop a cycling strategy as it can clearly contribute to improving not only people's health but the environment. Enabling local authorities to recognise their priorities has since been strengthened through the second local transport plans and local area agreements.</p>

<a name="80402-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08040274000070"></a>In summary, Cycling England's programme and other initiatives such as Sustainable Travel Towns have given insight and inspiration to all local authorities as to what can be achieved in terms of improving health and contributing to a better environment, while the local transport plans and local area agreements provide a framework for them to achieve precisely that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08040274000071"></a>Some of the contributions this evening were truly inspirational. I certainly cannot match the exploits of the noble Lord, Lord Young, with his trip from Land's End to John O&#146;Groats. If someone in your Lordships' House is giving a lead and showing himself to be a role model, the noble Lord, Lord Young, is the number one candidate. He has done his bit for the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08040274000072"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, has done his bit for health. His was a wonderful practical example of how one person can adjust their lifestyle to improve their life expectancy. The noble Viscount is willing and more than capable of picking up that baton and also receiving a prize. I also congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on his contribution in terms of adding to our wisdom on the subject and making the links with health. He also asked two very good points, one of which I shall follow up&#151;he made an interesting technical point about the position of electric bikes. I have heard that before, but I shall write to the noble Earl about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08040274000073"></a>Like the noble Earl, I, too, am attracted by the pick-up and drop-off schemes. I will not become an advocate of Boris&#146;s mayoral candidacy, but I know that our good friend Ken Livingstone, with his the big injection of funds for cycling in London is more than his equal to claim to be the cyclist&#146;s friend. Ken recently committed to pick up on all good ideas, and we will see that as being one of the most urgent to assist with after the outcome of the mayoral elections is secure. I congratulate all noble Lords who have participated. I have greatly enjoyed this debate and if we can spread a little more sunshine in the world of the cycling fraternity then we will do your Lordships' House and the nation a good service.</p>

I am quite clear what I am trying to do, which is to prevent the crisis in prison overcrowding from getting worse than it already is. For that purpose, we must confine the indeterminate sentence to those who have committed really serious offences. That means offenders who are serving a tariff of four years or more; anything less than that will achieve nothing.

When he replies to what further debate there will be&#151;I do not suppose that there will be further debate&#151;I hope that he will explain why, in the Government&#146;s view, two years will be enough to solve the problem.

We are attempting to strike a balance between ruling out cases that are simply not serious enough to be considered in this light and allowing the courts, as I said, to detain very worrying offenders, even if their immediate offence is not so serious as to deserve an extremely weighty sentence. I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, went on to describe the potential problems that he saw with persons sentenced under those provisions given the pressures on the Prison Service. I understand that, but the Government have taken, and are taking, steps, as I described earlier, to increase the resources and the priority that are given to the programmes that need to be established to enable these prisoners to satisfy the requirements of the Parole Board.

But surely the purpose is not just to exclude trivial offences from the ambit of indeterminate sentences, as the noble Lord said. We must go further than that if we are serious about reducing prison overpopulation. Nothing less than a four-year measure will do that, whether it be four years as the tariff or two years as the tariff&#151;I entirely agree that there is confusion about that. I have tried to work out what the two-year measure actually means: whether it is the equivalent of four years less a 50 per cent reduction&#151;because, as we know, all sentences of a certain kind are reduced by 50 per cent&#151;or whether it means two years literally. We must come back to that. I am afraid that I am not satisfied that merely excluding trivial offenders will make any difference at all to the present problem.</p>

It has always been our intention that this approach should apply equally to offenders who are liable, due to their youth, to a maximum penalty of detention for life or custody for life, rather than imprisonment for life.

It contains the Government&#146;s definition of dangerousness, which, as anyone who has had anything to do with dangerousness will know, is an extremely elusive subject.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08040274000109"></a>Under Section 229 as it stands, the court is bound to assume dangerousness in certain circumstances. That is the effect of subsections (3) and (4) of that section. I need not go into details on that. It is a good example of the Government&#146;s determination back in 2003 to impose their will on the judges. But subsections (3) and (4) are now to be repealed&#151;that is a good thing, too. Instead, we are left with subsection (2). All that it does is to say that the court must take account, when assessing dangerousness, of,</p>
<ul><a name="08040274000164"></a>&#147;such information as is available about the nature&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000143"></a>of the offence and that it may take account of any information about the offender, including any previous convictions.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08040274000110"></a>I have to ask whether the Government really suppose that judges have not always taken previous convictions into account when assessing dangerousness. Of course they have. What, then, is the point of telling judges that they may do what they have always done? If Clause 17 passes into law, Section 229 will serve no purpose at all. The Government&#146;s attempt in 2003 to define dangerousness has failed and they should recognise that fact. I hope that between now and Third Reading saneness will prevail. There is simply no point in maintaining the shadow of the old Section 229  on the statute book. It should be repealed forthwith. I beg to move.</p>

He argues&#151;as always, with great persuasiveness&#151;that, having butchered it, there is nothing left. Perhaps I may argue that there is something left and that it is important to leave it in the statute. I shall do so as briefly as I can.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08040274000112"></a>Without Section 229, the courts would have no statutory framework at all for making an assessment of risk. They would have no specific entitlement not just to look at the circumstances of the trigger offence but also to take account of all such information as was available about the pattern of behaviour of which the offence formed part. That is a matter of particular relevance to a court which has a special responsibility for assessing an offender&#146;s prospective dangerousness and it is a hallmark of public protection sentencing.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08040274000113"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord will not mind my citing the case of R v Considine, which I am sure he knows extremely well. The reference is Court of Appeal, 2008, Volume 1 of the <I>Weekly Law Reports</I>, page 414. In it, a strong court of five judges had to decide issues surrounding the use of information that was not proven evidence but related to what information a court could use in making its assessment of risk. In that case, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against an IPP given to an offender for making two threats to kill and having a knife in a public place. The question on appeal was whether the assessment of dangerousness for the purposes of Sections 225 to 229 had been based in part on inadmissible material.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08040274000114"></a>The court noted that Section 229 specified that the court may take account of any information before it about the offender. It also noted that similar language is used in Section 229(2)(b) and (c), which apply to persons with no previous convictions, and those two paragraphs would remain in Section 229. The court held that,</p>
<ul><a name="08040274000165"></a>&#147;as a matter of statutory construction, relevant information bearing on the assessment of dangerousness may take the form of material adverse to the offender which is not substantiated or proved by criminal convictions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000144"></a>We do not agree with the suggestion that Section 229 is unnecessary and that courts would be entitled to look at all such information anyway. The information that a court can take into account is affected by the purpose for which the court is considering it.</p>

<a name="80402-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08040274000115"></a>The Court of Appeal interpreted Section 229 and the special public protection policy function that it serves. It held that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account information that would have been excluded if he had been considering the punishment element of the sentence to be imposed. When assessing the risk of dangerousness, the court does so not for the sake of punishing the offender but for the purpose of protecting the public by determining whether the offender is dangerous and thus potentially liable to a public protection sentence. We argue that this policy dimension is served by the language that remains in Section 229 and that it should be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08040274000116"></a>I take the point made by the noble and learned Lord about previous convictions. We think that there is an advantage in making it clear to criminal justice agencies and to the general public, if not to learned judges, that previous convictions are, of course, very relevant to the assessment of risk. We believe that makes it transparent and encourages confidence. I rely, in arguing with the noble and learned Lord, on the information parts of Section 229(2); in other words, new subsections (2A) and (2)(aa).</p>

I shall look at the case to which he has referred. It is important for the House to appreciate that the courts have been passing life sentences for the protection of the public for as long as I can remember. They have never needed any statutory authority to make an assessment of dangerousness. Clearly established in all the textbooks is the fact that a life sentence for the protection of the public can be, and always has been, capable of being passed on three conditions: first, that the offence was one which of itself carried the maximum sentence of life imprisonment; secondly, that the particular offence was itself sufficiently grave to justify a very long sentence; and, thirdly, necessarily, that the court had to be satisfied from the offender&#146;s criminal record, from his past history or from any relevant medical evidence that he was a grave danger to the public. No statutory authority was required for that. That is what the courts have always done. That is why I suggest that Clause 17 now serves no conceivable purpose other than stating what the courts already do, but I shall certainly look at the case that has been referred to.</p>

As one does in such circumstances, I turned to the Explanatory Notes, which say that under this clause the judge must distinguish between three things: first, serious offences; secondly, exceptionally serious offences; and, thirdly, offences with,</p>
<ul><a name="08040274000166"></a>&#147;a very extreme degree of exceptionality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08040274000145"></a>Those are the very words that one finds on page 38 of the Explanatory Notes, which explain the need for the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08040274000126"></a>The judge is required to identify something which is exceptionally exceptionable, to use a phrase used by Mr Garnier in the other place. When judges are required to do such things, does that not illustrate what a quagmire we have got into when Parliament takes a hand in sentencing? When I became a judge 30 years ago, sentencing was difficult, as it must always be, but at least there was a framework which we could all understand. Now sentencing has become a nightmare: it is a nightmare for counsel; it is a nightmare for judges; and it is a nightmare for which Parliament must take a very large share of the responsibility. Clause 19 is a good example of the kind of nightmare in which we all now get involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08040274000127"></a>The purpose of Clause 19, so far as I can ascertain it, is to provide for two types of case which are, on any view, likely to arise only very rarely in practice. I will not attempt to describe them, but leave it to the Minister when he replies. The one thing of which I am absolutely sure is that, by enacting Clause 19, we are only going to make the nightmare worse. We will provide yet more opportunity for judges to slip up&#151;heaven knows there are enough opportunities for that already&#151;and more opportunities for appeals to the Court of Appeal.</p>

He wisely handed that over to the experts at the Bank of England and was much praised for doing so. I respectfully suggest that he now do the same for sentencing. Why does he not accept that the judges are the experts here, guided as they are by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, set up under the  2005 Act, and decisions of the Court of Appeal? Of course, Parliament has a role to play in the broad field of sentencing&#151;there is no doubt about that&#151;but nobody could justify Clause 19 on the ground that it deals with broad grounds of sentencing policy.</p>

Those ingredients are infinitely variable from case to case and do not lend themselves sensibly to the exercise of ticking boxes. When the Minister winds up, which he will do in about 30 seconds so far as I am concerned, I hope he will identify the deficiency in the current practice of the judges that in the minds of the Government make this clause necessary.</p>

This is labyrinthine, if I can use another metaphor. It can have the result that happened in Cardiff when a Crown Court judge of great experience&#151;the Recorder of Cardiff, who has since been made a High Court judge&#151;followed previous directions of this nature to the letter and was criticised for his sentence by the Home Secretary and, as I recall, the Prime Minister, who simply did not understand the nature of the legislation that their own Government had passed. One can see that so readily happening here when the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, may be called upon in the Ministry of Justice to criticise a judicial decision when somebody is simply following the maze that he is creating.</p>

Whatever criticism may be made of the Government or my department, my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor has clearly signalled his intention to work hard to establish the right and proper relationship with the judiciary. Thinking back to his appointment last summer, I do not think there has been one instance when he has criticised the judiciary. That signals the intent.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08040277000003"></a>I gather from noble Lords that they do not like this clause. I recognise that there is the question of what is in the clause and the more general question about judicial discretion. I shall deal with the clause first and then come on to the important question of the right relationship between Parliament and the judiciary, which has been at the heart of a great many of our discussions tonight and during other stages in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08040277000004"></a>This clause is designed to give courts wider discretion to set suitably high tariffs for offenders who have received a life sentence for a particularly serious crime. I should emphasise, as other noble Lords have done, that it is intended to apply to exceptional cases   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1130"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only rather than to routine life sentences. It will apply where an offender receives a discretionary life sentence; that is to say, any life sentence other than a life sentence imposed for murder under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It will not apply to sentences of imprisonment for public protection; that is to say, indeterminate sentences.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08040277000005"></a>Section 82A of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 specifies that when setting tariffs for discretionary life sentences, courts shall take into account the seriousness of the offence, remand time and early release provisions for determinate sentences. There has been concern that that results in a method of calculating the tariff that can undermine public confidence because the courts determine the punishment part or tariff of the life sentence by using the appropriate determinate sentence as a starting point, which is then halved to take account of the fact that an offender with a determinate sentence will be released on parole at the halfway point of the sentence. This exercise in some very serious cases can seem to result in what appear to be disproportionately short tariffs. An example is the case of Sweeney. Sweeney was sentenced to life imprisonment for the offences of kidnap and sexual assault of a child under 13. Following the usual calculation, his tariff amounted to six years.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08040277000006"></a>This clause will mean that where a particularly serious crime has been committed by a person over 18, judges will be able to calculate tariffs without taking into account the parole arrangements that apply to standard determinate sentences. Under the current law they must do so, which means that the final tariff is assessed as half of what the full determinate sentence would be. This clause&#151;the Case A&#151;allows the court to apply some reduction less than 50 per cent or to make no reduction at all, as appropriate in the particular circumstances of an individual case. The Case B element of this clause reflects case law and allows a court to apply a smaller reduction to the tariff, though not less than one-third. </p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08040277000007"></a>The exceptional cases to which this is relevant have historically been ones where an offender already serving a determinate sentence is sentenced for another offence to an indeterminate sentence. For technical reasons, the tariff of an indeterminate sentence should not run consecutively to the tariff of a determinate sentence, but, for reasons of justice, it may be important to ensure that the later offence will result in the prisoner serving extra time in custody. Case B is simply to maintain case law; it brings nothing new to sentencing practice. It is Case A that introduces the new discretion for exceptionally serious cases. The Government believe that the clause will meet a gap in the current law where the type of sentence that would normally be imposed on a determinate basis would not be adequate.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08040277000008"></a>I fully accept that that refers to cases in exceptional circumstances. I also understand concerns raised by noble Lords that Parliament should not seek to micromanage the performance of the judiciary, in whom we have great confidence or, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said, go towards a tick-box approach. That is not our intent at all.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08040277000009"></a>I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, when he says that it is Parliament&#146;s duty to accept the broad parameters under which the courts work by legislation and then for the judiciary to have discretion within that framework, and to have regard to judgments given by superior courts and the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council&#151;which, as noble Lords know, is an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice. I also say to the noble and learned Lord that the Sentencing Commission Working Group published its consultation on establishing a structured sentence framework on 31 March. That arose from the Carter recommendations, which suggested that there was a need, in thinking through criminal justice policy in future, to ensure that all the relevant elements were brought together, so that there was consistency of purpose. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will want to respond to that consultation.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08040277000010"></a>I fully accept that it is one thing for me to stand here and say that I agree with the noble and learned Lord that Parliament should set the broad framework and then we ought to allow the judiciary to get on with the job. He will then point me to legislation that he thinks does not meet the case. Of course there are instances of that. There will be reasons why Parliament seeks to be more precise in certain ways.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08040277000011"></a>It is interesting to look at our various debates so far. By my reckoning, noble Lords have argued against greater judicial discretion in about six or seven cases; whereas, in another five cases, noble Lords have argued for greater judicial discretion. In a sense, that is part of the parliamentary process: we tend to pray in aid whatever argument we can discharge to make the case for the point that we believe in.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08040277000012"></a>Although in general all noble Lords will sign up to increased judicial discretion, clearly, as legislation goes through, there are areas where they say, &#147;On that matter, we do not think that there should be greater judicial discretion. We want to give a clear indication to the judiciary of what they should be doing&#148;. In our debates on youth justice, many noble Lords have been concerned that there is too much judicial discretion. We can see why Parliament is sometimes tempted to fetter the judiciary.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08040277000013"></a>I am not trying to excuse the Government from their responsibility to ensure that there is a proper balance between parliamentary direction and judicial discretion; I am trying to say to the noble and learned Lord that it is often easier said than done. The sentencing framework to which I referred and the consultation that has just been held will, I hope, provide us with a sensible way forward that meets the Government&#146;s needs and those of noble Lords who wish to reinforce the discretion of our excellent judiciary.</p>

That may shed some light on it. The mere fact that he has to offer to write to us shows that this is the sort of clause that should not be in legislation. It is intended to cover the appearance of injustice in only one case&#151;the Sweeney case, to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred&#151;where there was no injustice at all because the judge did exactly what Parliament said he must do. It therefore illustrates both aspects of my argument. It is a marvellous example of Parliament interfering where it is not wanted. Parliament is now asked to give judges greater discretion, but the discretion should not have been removed in the first place. It is a very good example of Parliament interfering in such a way as to make the judges&#146; task even more difficult than it already is. I hope that the clause will be considered for a second time in the Ministry of Justice. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08040277000019"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, after the extremely elevated tone of the previous debate, I almost hesitate to introduce this amendment. Nevertheless, I will introduce it. This is one of a family of issues which the Government advanced, I think, following the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, on Report in another place. I am not going to speculate on the reasons why a number of these measures were introduced; I am simply going to introduce my amendment, which I can do briefly as I did in Committee.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08040277000020"></a>I am asking the Government to insert after Clause 19 the following new clause, entitled, &#147;Increase in maximum term that may be imposed on summary conviction of offence triable either way&#148;. The substance reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="08040277000038"></a>&#147;Section 282 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) (increase in maximum term that may be imposed on summary conviction of offence triable either way) shall come into force on the passing of this Act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08040277000034"></a>In other words, all we wish to do is to bring into law a matter which the Government always intended to bring into law as a result of the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The amendment would in effect implement a clause that originally appeared in the Government&#146;s Act. I am not sure why the Government have not yet implemented this clause.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08040277000021"></a>One of the factors that I think lay behind the Government&#146;s intentions in 2003 was a scheme called custody plus. We know that, for a variety of reasons, it has not been possible to introduce that yet. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what the Government&#146;s intentions were with respect to it. I have no doubt that factors such as resources, finance

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08040277000022"></a>Quite independently of custody plus, we think that, in itself, the substance of the proposal in the 2003 Act is inherently desirable. I suspect that the Government are trying to walk away from this because they fear that the consequence of it would be more people going to prison. I see no reason why that should be so. Magistrates have a sentencing structure in which to operate. In so far as I have had experience of watching magistrates&#146; courts in operation, I have no doubt that they will abide by the appropriate guidelines in their sentencing policy. We think that this is an important power for magistrates to have. For that reason, I beg to move.</p>

Section 282 of the 2003 Act was designed to enable magistrates&#146; courts, as the noble Lord implied, to give custody plus sentences in respect of these offences. There has never been any intention to increase the sentencing powers of the magistrates&#146; courts in this way as a freestanding measure. We have, as noble Lords by now will have gathered, no date for the implementation of custody plus. Let me be frank: it is a question of resources as much as anything else. </p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08040277000024"></a>As I explained, the increased custody limit would not actually result in any longer period of actual prison time under a custody plus sentence. Magistrates&#146; courts would be able to impose 13 weeks for one offence, which is the same as the three months&#146; prison time that they can currently give. We have never espoused the principle that the magistrates&#146; courts should be able to hand down more actual prison time. It would mean more time for supervision under the custody plus measures.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08040277000025"></a>If Section 282 were to be implemented without the rest of the custody plus legislation&#151;the noble Lord has made it clear that he thinks that there is merit in it in any event&#151;the magistrates&#146; courts could give 12 months&#146; actual prison time for one offence. That would be a very substantial increase&#151;a radical change&#151;and an important alteration in our criminal justice institutions and principles. We do not think this is appropriate or necessary. Even at this late hour, perhaps I may pose a question to the noble Lord. What is the maximum total sentence that he is suggesting the magistrate should be able to pass in all, given that there might be consecutive sentences? If the maximum of each one can be 12 months, where does it end without custody plus?</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08040277000026"></a>The magistrates&#146; courts are lay courts, which do a wonderful job. They represent the community, but it has never been their role to deal with the most serious and dangerous offenders, who may require long custodial sentences. On a previous occasion, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, argued that it is logical for magistrates&#146; courts to have increased powers in respect of triable either-way offences, as against summary-only offences. We do not agree. The logical  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>position is that magistrates&#146; courts and the Crown Court have their own areas of expertise, relating to the seriousness of the offending. The point about offences triable either way is that they can span a range of seriousness. At the lower end they are absolutely suitable for magistrates&#146; courts to deal with and more serious cases are suitable for the Crown Court to deal with.</p>

<a name="80402-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08040277000027"></a>Anyone who has practised in the criminal courts knows that magistrates&#146; courts can and do send cases to the Crown Court for sentence if they think that the case is sufficiently serious and falls outside their sentencing powers. We do not believe that it can be argued that the proposed amendment is necessary to ensure that offenders receive their just deserts. As I assured noble Lords in Committee, Clause 53 will ensure that the power to direct is available undiminished under Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act when it is implemented. I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08040254000020"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08040254000266"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Lord Adonis):</b></b> I am today announcing the outcome of a review of the suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08040254000021"></a>In June 2004, the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, Margaret Hodge, announced the suspension of adoptions in response to concerns raised and investigated by officials from the DfES (now DCSF) who visited Cambodia, by the British embassy in Cambodia and, separately, by other stakeholders about the intercountry adoption process in Cambodia.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08040254000022"></a>A review of the suspension was announced last year and was carried out by my department. The purpose of the review was to update the information on which the suspension was based, to find out what concerns, if any, remain valid and whether there are any other concerns about practices taking place.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08040254000023"></a>The review work assessed the current situation in Cambodia regarding intercountry adoption, including what changes, if any, to practice and legislation have been made in the three years since the temporary suspension was introduced. The review also took account of Cambodia&#146;s accession to The Hague Convention (on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993).</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08040254000024"></a>On 12 December, the UK lodged an objection to Cambodia&#146;s accession to The Hague Convention, in accordance with Article 44 of the convention. Cambodia&#146;s accession to the convention therefore has no effect as regards relations between the UK and Cambodia.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08040254000025"></a>Evidence from the review demonstrates that: adoption legislation, practice and procedure in Cambodia remain insufficient to ensure the proper protection of children and their families; lifting the suspension at the current time would expose Cambodian children and their families to an increased risk of improper practices which are contrary to the principles of the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (The Hague Convention) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08040254000026"></a>The suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents therefore still remains in place. I will of course consider the effect of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Cambodia in keeping the suspension under review.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08040254000027"></a>I am also announcing today the outline timetable for the implementation of the statutory provisions relating to the restrictions of adoptions from abroad in the Children and Adoption Act 2002. I intend to implement Sections 9 and 10 and, in so far as they are not already in force, Sections 11 and 12 of the 2006 Act in summer 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08040254000028"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08040254000267"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b></b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation, Universities and Skills (Ian Pearson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08040254000029"></a>I am today placing in the Library of the House copies of a study by the Intellectual Property Institute (IPI) into the effect on the UK art market of the introduction of the artist&#146;s resale right (ARR).</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08040254000030"></a>The directive 2001/84/EC on the resale right for the benefit of the author of an original work of art was adopted in 2001. This required a new right, &#147;artist&#146;s resale right&#148;, (often referred to by its French name droit de suite) to be introduced into the United Kingdom by 1 January 2006.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08040254000031"></a>Due to concerns over the potential impact that the introduction of ARR might have on the UK art market, the UK Government successfully secured a number of concessions within the directive to lessen its impact. These were:</p>
 a cap of &#8364;12,500 royalty on any one sale;a commitment from the EC that it would make it a priority to negotiate internationally to make the relevant article of the Berne Convention mandatory so that the right would be introduced in the USA and Switzerland (on which little has yet been done nor it seems is likely to be done); anda derogation to 2010, extendable upon request to 2012, allowing the UK to delay applying the right to works by deceased artists.
<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08040254000032"></a>The implementing regulations were brought into force in the UK on 14 February 2006. ARR entitles artists and, for 70 years after death, their successors in title, to a percentage of the sale price whenever original works of art are resold in transactions involving art market professionals.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08040254000033"></a>The purpose of the study, commissioned by the UK Intellectual Property Office, was to provide:</p>
an assessment of the impact on the UK art market of the introduction of artist&#146;s resale right (ARR);an assessment of the costs, both to business and collecting societies, of administering the right; andan assessment of the benefit to artists in the introduction of the right. 
<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08040254000034"></a>The Government are considering this evidence to develop our understanding of the impact of ARR on UK creativity and the UK art market.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="08040254000039"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80402-wms0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08040254000270"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b></b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08040254000040"></a>I am today laying the draft Heritage Protection Bill and Explanatory Notes for pre-legislative scrutiny. Copies of the related impact assessment are available in the Vote and Printed Paper Offices.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08040254000041"></a>This is a draft Bill for England and Wales, which sets out the legislative framework for a unified and simpler heritage protection system that will be more open, accountable and transparent. The new system will provide more opportunities for public involvement and community engagement in understanding, preserving and managing our heritage. As the impact assessment makes clear, the main benefits of the reforms introduced by the Heritage Protection Bill are not best expressed in terms of the financial balance sheet, but are better understood in terms of public value and sustainability. The reforms set out in this Bill will enable us to preserve the historic environment and manage its transition to the future, in the light of both present values and in the interest of future generations.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08040254000042"></a>The draft Bill is based on the proposals set out in the White Paper, <I>Heritage Protection for the 21</I><sup><I>st</I></sup><I> Century </I>(March 2007), which itself was based on three key principles: the need to develop a unified approach to the historic environment; maximising opportunities for inclusion and involvement; and supporting sustainable communities by putting the historic environment at the heart of an effective planning system.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08040254000043"></a>The draft Heritage Protection Bill contains provisions for a single system for national designation (&#147;registration&#148;) of terrestrial heritage assets to replace the listing of buildings, scheduling of monuments and registering of parks, gardens, battlefields and, in Wales, historic landscapes.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS102"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column WS102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08040254000044"></a>In England, we will be transferring responsibility for national designation of all these assets to English Heritage; in Wales that responsibility will remain with the Welsh Ministers. There will be new heritage registers, one each for England and Wales, containing details of all nationally designated heritage assets, as well as World Heritage sites in England and Wales. There will also be formal appeals or review mechanisms for registration decisions, and provisional registration to give &#147;interim protection&#148; to historic assets while they are being considered for registration, as well as wider formal consultation on applications to register.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08040254000045"></a>Alongside this unification of designation, we will be unifying and streamlining the associated consent processes, with the introduction of a new heritage asset consent to replace listed building consent and scheduled monument consent, and the merger of conservation area consent with planning permission. In England, the new heritage asset consent will be administered by local planning authorities, allowing the management of the historic environment to take place at local level; in Wales, the draft Bill will provide flexibility to allow central decision making where appropriate, recognising the different levels of capacity in Wales.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08040254000046"></a>We recognise the need for effective conservation and management of the historic environment at local level to be knowledge-based, and for the records of our historic environment to be available to as many people as possible. This Bill will secure the basis for informed stewardship of the historic environment, within and beyond the planning system, by placing local authorities under a new statutory duty to maintain or have access to an historic environment record (HER). HERs are a comprehensive resource on the local historic environment, containing information on archaeological sites and finds, historic buildings and historic landscapes, complementing and enriching our existing collections of museum, archives and libraries. In keeping with this drive towards greater accessibility, the new heritage registers will also be available online and new records will be simpler, clearer and more detailed.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08040254000047"></a>The draft Bill will also introduce a new statutory framework for voluntary management agreements between the owners of heritage sites and structures and local or other authorities. These agreements will free owners from the need for repetitive consent applications for similar works, reducing the bureaucratic and administrative burdens for owners and local authorities alike, and providing greater certainty on the long-term management of the site.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08040254000048"></a>Striking the balance between flexibility and the need to ensure protection alongside conservation and management characterises our proposals to reform the marine heritage protection system in England and Wales. We have broadened the range of marine historic assets that can be protected, ensuring that there is greater consistency&#151;where appropriate&#151;with the terrestrial system, and brought greater flexibility to the licensing system. As we have done for terrestrial designations, we have also built a formal consultation process into the registration of marine heritage sites and ensured protection for those assets formally being considered for designation.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08040254000049"></a>These reforms will give us a heritage protection system that is open, flexible and accountable. Our heritage is an important source of national and community identity; people recognise its value and work hard, voluntarily and professionally, to ensure its conservation and pass it on. We are increasingly recognising the value of the historic environment in contributing to the Government's wider agenda in terms of place-making and promoting economic prosperity through regeneration and sustainable use of existing resources. The proposals in the draft Heritage Protection Bill will enable us and future generations to benefit from a thriving, well managed, sustainable and widely enjoyed historic environment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08040254000050"></a>The draft Bill we are publishing today follows long and extensive consultation.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08040254000061"></a>On 4 February 2008, I laid before Parliament a Written Ministerial Statement about payments under the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives scheme (LABGI) in the light of legal challenge (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 47WS). I am now in a position to announce the methodology the Government intend to use, to make additional payments to local authorities for years 1 and 2 of the scheme and to make payments for year 3 of the three-year scheme.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS105"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column WS105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08040254000062"></a>For years 1 and 2, the Government propose to make additional payments to eligible local authorities using all Valuation Office Agency change codes which record an increase in rateable value and which were not previously used in LABGI calculations. This will ensure that all codes that could contain elements of business growth are taken into account. As a result, we propose that additional payments totalling approximately &#163;50.9 million should be made to authorities (approximately &#163;13.5 million for year 1 and &#163;37.3 million for year 2).</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08040254000063"></a>For year 3, the Government intend to replicate the revised methodology for years 1 and 2 of the scheme in year 3. As I indicated in my Statement of 4 February, it is necessary at this stage to retain a portion of the year 3 funding as a contingency and I intend to retain &#163;100 million.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08040254000064"></a>A further announcement about the distribution of the remaining funding will be made in due course. This funding will be allocated to local authorities in full, in line with the policy purposes for which LABGI was designed. The exact methodology will be confirmed once any uncertainty associated with legal challenges has been resolved.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08040254000065"></a>The Government, therefore, are able to allocate around &#163;246 million to authorities at this stage for year 3 of the scheme. As in previous years, it will be necessary to apply a scaling factor to the calculated allocations in year 3 to ensure that the funding distributed does not exceed the amount available.

In discussion with interested parties, we have drawn up a proposed model for how best value would work and we are now consulting publicly on this. </p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08040254000073"></a>The proposed best-value model would apply to all services funded by probation boards and trusts.  It would enable boards and trusts to demonstrate, in a transparent way, the value for money of their services, and to drive improvements in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their service delivery.  Best value reviews would be based around five areas&#151;consult, compare, challenge, collaborate and, where appropriate, compete.  The reviews may result in the competition of services, but only if they have shown that that would be the most efficient and effective delivery option. The best-value process is neutral as to the final result.  By delivering efficiency savings, best value will provide value for money to the taxpayer and, by improving the effectiveness of service delivery to offenders, it will contribute towards our aim of reducing re-offending.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08040254000076"></a>We are gravely concerned about the situation in Gaza. The closure of Gaza&#146;s crossings is contributing to the collapse of the economy. There are shortages of essential humanitarian supplies such as medicines, foodstuffs and hearing aids. Restrictions on supplies of fuel and electricity have led to widespread power cuts and water shortages. While we fully understand Israel&#146;s security concerns, we do not support the decision to close Gaza crossings. The Foreign Secretary and I have called on Israel to open them, and to lift all restrictions immediately on humanitarian supplies and electricity. While resolving the humanitarian situation is in the hands of the parties concerned, we are doing what we can to help alleviate the situation.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08040254000077"></a>In order to address the humanitarian situation, to support the Palestinian economy and to meet the urgent funding needs of the Palestinian Authority, we intend to provide an additional &#163;30 million in support to the Palestinians in 2007-08, taking our total contribution to &#163;63.6 million for this financial year. This is part of the pledge of up to &#163;243 million over three years, linked to political progress, which I announced at the Paris donor conference last December. The UK is leading the international community in following through on its Paris pledges promptly, providing funding when it is most needed before other pledges come through.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08040254000078"></a>This new funding will strengthen the Palestinian Authority&#146;s ability to take forward reform at a critical time. It will help pay teachers, doctors and engineers, keep basic services running and meet the budget

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="08040254000080"></a>DfID&#146;s support for Gazans includes our agreement to provide &#163;100 million over five years to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). UNRWA provides healthcare, housing, education and food to Palestinian refugees across the Middle East. Seventy per cent of people in Gaza are refugees who will benefit directly from this assistance.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="08040254000083"></a>Before October 1998, there were no checks in the system to prevent the sale of school playing fields. Local authorities could sell school playing fields and use the proceeds for whatever purpose they saw fit.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="08040254000084"></a>Since 1998, under Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, all local authorities and maintained schools in England have needed the consent of the Secretary of State before they can dispose of a school playing field or any part of a school playing field.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="08040254000085"></a>Published guidance sets out the criteria for giving consent and makes it clear that a disposal will only be allowed if the sports and curriculum needs of schools and their neighbouring schools continue to be met. Community usage of school playing fields is considered in decisions and any sale proceeds must be reinvested in outdoor sports facilities where possible, or, if not, in indoor sport or education facilities.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS108"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column WS108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="08040254000086"></a>In addition, since July 2001 all applications to dispose of school playing fields have been scrutinised by an independent school playing fields advisory panel. The panel comprises representatives from Fields in Trust (formerly the National Playing Fields Association), the Central Council of Physical Recreation, Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="08040254000087"></a>The panel advises the Secretary of State on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria for giving consent. The panel brings a rigorous independent scrutiny to the assessment process.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="08040254000088"></a>In November 2004, the rules governing the sale of school playing fields were tightened so that the sale of a playing field is an absolute last resort with local authorities having to demonstrate that they have exhausted all other sources of funding. Sale proceeds must be used to improve outdoor sports facilities where possible and new sports facilities must be sustainable for at least 10 years.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="08040254000089"></a>This Government have not committed themselves to end the sale of surplus school playing fields in any circumstances. What we did commit to end was the previous position of putting local authorities in a position where they had to sell those fields simply to pay for essential repairs. Our record levels of capital investment in schools&#151;from under &#163;700 million in 1996-97 to more than &#163;8 billion by 2011&#151;have also helped bring that situation to an end. One thousand one hundred completely new schools have already been built&#151;with brand new sports facilities and outdoor play areas. Another 2,450 schools have made massive improvements to sports provision, with newly built sports halls, all-weather pitches, gyms, playgrounds or changing rooms.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="08040254000090"></a>This Government legislated to ensure that school playing fields are sold only where they are genuinely surplus to local needs, including those of neighbouring schools. This Government have ensured that the proceeds of sales are invested mainly in providing new sports facilities, including new grassed pitches, all-weather pitches and sports halls.   Where no sports improvements are needed, the money from sales must be used to improve educational facilities.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_204"></a><a name="08040254000236"></a>On 17 December, the Secretary of State for Transport announced to Parliament a number of immediate measures to improve the security of personal data handled by the Department for Transport and its agencies. This included the precautionary requirement that any bulk transfer of personal data not by electronic transmission should take place through point-to-point transfer by a secure courier.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_210"></a><a name="08040254000244"></a>I announced plans last September to set up an independent regulator of qualifications and tests. In December, along with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, I announced, for consultation, more detailed proposals. Subject to legislation, the new Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual) will act as independent guardian of standards across the tests and qualifications system in England. The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) will develop curriculum, assessment and qualifications. I wish to update the House on progress with these plans.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_211"></a><a name="08040254000245"></a>As we develop and reform qualifications and tests, it is critical not only that they are of the highest quality, but also that they are seen so to be. The new arrangements that we are putting in place will help to achieve this, underpinning high-quality qualifications and tests with high levels of confidence. In making this change, we are building on the principles that underpinned the establishment of, for example, the Monetary Policy Committee and the Statistics Board, which have improved public trust in the systems they regulate through a combination of independence, clarity of remit and a transparent accountability framework. The joint command paper (Cm 7281) <I>Confidence in Standards: Regulating and developing qualifications and  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS114"></a><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column WS114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assessment</I><I>,</I> published in December, sought views on the roles and powers of the independent regulator and of the development agency for curriculum, assessment and qualifications into which QCA will develop. The consultation period closed on 10 March. The proposals were generally well received, and there were lots of valuable and detailed points on which we will need to reflect as we develop our detailed proposals. We will publish a formal response to the consultation paper by mid June.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_212"></a><a name="08040254000246"></a>In the mean time, we will continue as planned to make those changes we can achieve within the existing legislative framework, so that we can secure benefits from the reforms as soon as possible. As a first step, the Office of the Qualifications and Examination Regulator will shortly be established on an interim basis carrying out the QCA&#146;s regulatory functions across this spring and summer test and examination period. While working within current legislation, Ofqual will be operationally independent. These interim arrangements will be an important step towards the new regulatory landscape that we are developing, and in themselves will contribute to confidence in the standards of the tests and qualification system in England.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_213"></a><a name="08040254000247"></a>In the consultation paper on the reforms, we confirmed that we were setting in motion an appointments process for a chair of the regulator. Following a process overseen by the Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments, I am delighted to tell the House that Kathleen Tattersall OBE has been appointed to be the first chair of the new independent regulator. Kathleen is the chair of the Chartered Institute of Educational Assessors (which today receives its Royal Charter). Until 2003, she was director general of the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA), having been chief executive of a succession of awarding bodies over the previous 20 years. She will join the QCA board and lead Ofqual in its interim form. Subject to legislation, she will become the regulator&#146;s first chair when it is established as an independent statutory body. Kathleen Tattersall and Ofqual&#146;s acting chief executive, Isabel Nisbet, will play critical leadership roles in setting up the new organisation, setting its strategic direction and developing the new regulatory framework which it will operate.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_214"></a><a name="08040254000248"></a>Setting up a new regulator will help ensure that learners of all ages and their teachers feel that their hard work and achievements are properly recognised. We are confident that these reforms to the regulatory landscape will both provide greater transparency in the arrangements for regulating and developing qualifications and tests, and secure the confidence in standards on which they depend. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_215"></a><a name="08040254000250"></a>I made a Statement on 11 March in which I set out concerns about compliance with the school admissions code and admissions legislation, based on an internal review of the published admission arrangements of schools in a sample of three local authorities. I explained that my department was verifying the findings with the local authorities and schools concerned, and that we would present the detailed information to Parliament once we had given them the opportunity to respond.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_216"></a><a name="08040254000251"></a>I have today passed the results of this exercise on to the schools adjudicator to inform the work he is doing to ensure full compliance with all statutory requirements for admissions in 2009.

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_217"></a><a name="08040254000252"></a>I have also today published draft amendments to the Education and Skills Bill for consideration at Commons Report. The effect of the amendments will be to require local authorities to report to the schools adjudicator on admission arrangements in their areas; to extend the adjudicator&#146;s powers so that he can act where he considers that any admission arrangements are not compliant with the statutory requirements; and to improve the process of consultation on admission arrangements in order to ensure that parents and communities can contribute to the development of admissions policies for their schools. Copies of the draft amendments have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_218"></a><a name="08040254000253"></a>We are publishing today a step-by-step guide to the admissions and appeal processes for parents. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. The guide contains straightforward advice for parents on all aspects of choosing a school place for their child, and sets out what they can do if they have concerns about the legality of a school&#146;s admission arrangements. A copy of this guide will be made available for every parent applying for a school place in 2009.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_219"></a><a name="08040254000254"></a>My department will publish further detailed proposals in the early summer to improve the application and allocation process for parents and to further strengthen the admission system so that it works for all children. This will include an improved process for ensuring that parents and communities are consulted on admission arrangements for their schools and improvements to admission forums.</p>

<a name="80402-wms0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_220"></a><a name="08040254000255"></a>The steps I have taken today will help ensure that every parent has a fair chance of getting their child a place at a school of their choice, and that no parent or child will be disadvantaged by unfair admission arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_222"></a><a name="08040254000258"></a>So far, 10 areas have benefited from this pump-priming funding, enabling them to analyse their current and emerging congestion issues and consider how demand management could form part of the solution. In March 2008, we announced that we were extending the commitment to make available up to &#163;200 million a year out to 2018-19, in line with our long-term funding profile for transport, and inviting authorities to bid for further pump-priming development funding for 2008 and 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_223"></a><a name="08040254000259"></a>I am today announcing the first successful area to benefit from this additional funding.

We welcome the guidance and would encourage local police forces and returning officers to be vigilant in identifying any suspicious or fraudulent activity at the May elections.</p>

Some 260 of those employers were already working with Jobcentre Plus to implement their initial delivery plans, and a list of those employers has been placed in the Library. Jobcentre Plus is working through LEPs at a local level with many other smaller and medium-sized employers, and with some sites of larger employers who have not so far made a central commitment to work through LEPs.</p>

This means that where applications involve issues of flood risk, they have to be decided in line with the policies on flood risk set out in the local authority's local development documents (LDDs) or other development plans. LDDs should be consistent with national planning policy, including Planning Policy Statement 25 Development and Flood Risk (PPS25). Section 20(5) of the Act requires LDDs to be tested for their soundness at independent examination. Local authorities are also required to carry out a sustainability appraisal of their LDDs as part of their plan preparation, in order to inform decisions about site allocations. Where flooding is an issue the local authority should prepare a strategic flood risk assessment as required by PPS25 to inform the sustainability appraisal. The policy in PPS25 would be a material consideration in determining the soundness of the LDD.</p>

At the planning application level, applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposals with the local authority as early as possible, to check their compliance with the local authorities' policies. There is a statutory requirement on the local authority to consult the Environment Agency on planning applications in flood risk areas.</p>
