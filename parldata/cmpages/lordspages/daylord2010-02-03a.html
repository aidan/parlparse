<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what estimate they have made of the number of people injured as a result of the recent bad weather; and what has been the cost to the National Health Service of treating those people.</p>

<a name="10020377000002"></a><b><a name="100203-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10020377000224"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The NHS is well versed in dealing with operational challenges such as adverse weather, and these are factored into local contingency plans, including the cost of treating patients. It appears that the system has held up in recent times. We have not made any estimate of the number of people injured as a result of the recent bad weather as this is a matter for the local NHS, and it is too soon. However, provisional hospital admissions data for autumn and winter 2009-10 will be available from the NHS information centre in spring 2010.</p>

Does she agree, however, that it is almost certain that the number of people injured during the recent cold weather through slipping on snow and ice represents a much greater cost to the health service than the grit and salt that would have prevented those accidents? While I am not in any way criticising local authorities, which were faced with a sudden and unexpected winter, would it not be better in future for the Government to encourage local authorities to look at this in the round and say that more salt and grit stored in case of need would save a lot of injuries and a lot of pain and distress to people?</p>

I note from the Statement made by my noble friend the Secretary of State for Transport that the challenge that was faced in relation to grit and salt was actually about demand outstripping supply, rather than whether PCTs had given extra support to the local authorities to increase gritting.</p>

<a name="100203-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="10020377000005"></a>My noble friend will be pleased to hear that we are working with the Local Government Association to understand the impact of gritting patterns. We are looking at where people had their accidents-which parks, pavements, corners and car parks-because that is the most sensible way of working out where we need to spread grit and salt in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="10020377000009"></a>Accidents happen during cold weather, but I am more concerned about the excess winter deaths where hypothermia is a main factor. That is still a great concern to me. Why has this problem not improved over the past 10 years? The figures are still roughly the same as 10 years ago. We are still among the worst European countries. Why have the measures introduced by the Government so far not brought down excess winter deaths from hypothermia?</p>

Indeed, the name of the campaign that we launched in September was "Keep Warm Keep Well". I point out that this Government have increased the allowance for winter weather. We have had a campaign aimed at financially disadvantaged older people, disabled people, their carers and families with young children on low incomes to give them the information that they need and advice about eating and exercise-because it is not just about keeping warm-home heating, energy efficiency and the details of grants and benefits available. It is a very important campaign, which will have helped this winter.</p>

My original Answer made the point that we plan for this. I pay tribute to the staff in the health service for how they dealt with this, how they coped and how they ensured patients continued to receive care. Nurses walked miles to get to work because of the transport difficulties. Staff slept in hospitals to ensure that they could be there for duty the next day. Indeed, this was a great example of British co-operation-different organisations such as the coast-guards, Mountain Rescue and local paramedics helping people in remote areas.</p>

Reforming the CAP will improve the industry's ability to respond to consumer demand.

I make the obvious point that some regulations are essential. A substantial amount of the pollutants in our water comes from farms, so regulation is necessary there. Of course, some regulations result from European directives and we seek to bring pressure to reduce their impact. I agree with the noble Baroness that we should work with the industry to reduce regulation.</p>

We certainly control the quality of imported milk, but the conditions under which it is produced and the health of the animals is a different matter. However, that is exactly the area on which we seek to bring pressure to bear within the framework of the CAP to ensure that Europe improves and reaches the standards of which we are rightly proud in terms of our own animal health.</p>

It is estimated that up to half the food produced in developed countries is not consumed as a result of households throwing it away, supermarkets throwing it away unsold, and restaurants throwing it away. It is estimated that perhaps a third of the fruit and vegetables grown in this country never reaches consumers. Is this not an absolute scandal and would not food security in this country be dramatically improved if waste was cut down?</p>

The more advanced countries are more culpable in this respect. The noble Lord will know of the pressure that has been exerted on supermarkets with regard to their waste, and their response to it, one aspect of which is looking at the absurdity of sell-by dates which lead to some perfectly edible food being wasted. The noble Lord is at one with the Government in our determination to reduce food waste. In a world where some are going hungry, it is scandalous that we should have the levels of waste that we have in this country and in other advanced countries.</p>

The House will recall the unusual circumstances in which we passed the control order legislation five years ago after an all-night sitting. Do the Government have any alternative plan-plan B, as it were-if Parliament decides not to renew the legislation when it comes up for renewal next month? If so, could the Minister let us know what that plan is?</p>

None of us likes control orders. I did not like them when I came into post and I specifically asked whether there was any way of getting round them. A detailed study into this was done by the Security Service-SO15 OSCT-and control orders were the least worst option. There are a very small number of them-12, according to the last quoted figure and fewer than that now. We use them on a carefully selected basis.</p>

<a name="100203-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10020377000045"></a>I believe that they are necessary for the security of the nation. We do not like them and we have a lot of safeguards in place. Three High Court judgments have upheld individual control orders since the House of Lords judgment. Mr Justice Wilkie said of one of the cases that there was overwhelming evidence of past involvement in terrorism-related activity and future intentions to be so involved. It would be remiss of our Government not to look after the security of our nation. Control orders are absolutely necessary and I will fight tooth and nail to keep them because there is no easy alternative at the moment.</p>

The European Convention on Human Rights cannot, and the 1998 Act did not, prevent this Parliament, if so advised, passing legislation which is incompatible with one of the convention articles, provided that the intention of Parliament is made clear by an appropriate statement of incompatibility from the promoting Minister, in which case the courts will be bound to accept the legislation as it stands.

<p><a name="10020377000176"></a>Was the interview intended to pre-empt this morning's very disturbing report from Ofgem that we are now in serious danger of the lights going out during the course of this decade? Does the Minister recognise that Ofgem's first recommendation to encourage investment-not mentioned by the Secretary of State-is for greater certainty about the carbon price, something for which many of us have been arguing for quite a long time?</p>

I am sure that we shall all look at it with interest and I am sure that it will contribute to the debate. One must go beyond the headlines, because clearly it sets out a number of scenarios, some of which I think are most unlikely, and it does not give any quantification of the probability of each scenario. The work referred to by my right honourable friend is not in relation to the energy requirements, but much more about whether, going into the future, there are enough levers in the market to ensure that we can make the transition to a low-carbon economy. On the energy crunch, I point out that a considerable amount of construction is taking place at the moment in terms of generating capacity as regards primary energy, increasing import facilities and other measures to ensure that we have the right energy strategy in place.</p>

Is that not a remarkable coincidence? Does that not bring into question the independence of the regulator and how that coincidence can take place in such detail over a period of two days?</p>

It always feels to me that it is very independent. The work to which my right honourable friend referred is very important in relation to the future and ensuring that the market is fit for purpose as regards moving towards a low-carbon energy structure. However, I reaffirm that, as regards the rather alarmist statements which seem to have emanated from the Ofgem report, we are confident that the policies that we have in place will ensure energy security in the years ahead.</p>

As far as the issue of price is concerned, there is no doubt that the cost of climate change policies will lead to an increase in bills, but as the noble Lord, Lord Stern, has shown, it is much more cost-effective to do it at the start, rather than wait for many years to come.</p>

There is a serious problem of energy security and a lack of generating capacity lying ahead, because of the Government's absurd subordination of energy policy to a low-carbon policy focused on wholly uneconomic and impractical wind power.</p>

The fact is that it is absolutely right that as part of our response to the climate change challenge we move towards a low-carbon energy structure, but we are doing this in a way which will secure our energy supplies in the future; it will secure more home-grown energy in the future, and it will be done in a way in that the technology that we will be developing in this country will stand us in good stead and will also enable us to export technology to many countries of the world.</p>

There were four, or possibly five noble Lords present, including myself. I listened with great interest to the noble Lords, Lord Hunt, Lord Marland and Lord Teverson. The noble Lord, Lord Marland, stressed the importance of consultation with local communities. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to the size of the pylons, asking whether he would know one when he saw one. No noble Lord made any comment on the way an individual's health can be affected by a high voltage cable. I considered passing a note to my noble friend Lord Marland, but I decided that it would not be correct procedure to become involved in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10020377000075"></a>The order allows the installation of certain electric lines without the consent presently required under the 2008 Act. Any legislation that removes a requirement for consent is immediately suspicious, as it is believed by many that electrical currents and magnetic fields such as those set up by 400-kilovolt, 275-kilovolt and 132-kilovolt cables may have links to various diseases, ranging from leukaemia to headaches and insomnia. Before the order is approved, can the Minister give an absolute assurance that the health of people living close to these power lines will be carefully considered? </p>

On the specific point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, the balance of scientific evidence to date suggests that exposure to electromagnetic fields below the international guideline levels set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection is not harmful to the health of the general population. I confirm that we maintain a precautionary approach; we have adopted those guidelines and we will keep emerging science under review.</p>

They are: Captain Daniel Read of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps; Rifleman Luke Farmer of 3rd Battalion, The Rifles; Corporal Lee Brownson of 3rd Battalion, The Rifles; Rifleman Peter Aldridge of 4th Battalion, The Rifles; Lance Corporal Daniel Cooper, of 3rd Battalion, The Rifles; Lance Corporal Graham Shaw of 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment; and Corporal Liam Riley of 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment. I am sure that our thoughts are with all of their families and friends and, indeed, all who are serving in Afghanistan at the moment.</p>

<a name="100203-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10020377000078"></a>With the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary. The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="100203-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10020377000079"></a>"Mr Speaker, today I am publishing a Defence Green Paper which paves the way for a Strategic Defence Review, set in the context of the national security strategy, early in the next Parliament. At the present time, Afghanistan is the main effort for the Ministry of Defence. Where choices have to be made, Afghanistan will continue to be given priority. Our forces there are fighting hard, protecting our national security by preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorists.</p>

<a name="100203-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10020377000080"></a>Two hundred and fifty-three British service personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001. Many more have suffered life-changing injuries. Their bravery in the face of a ruthless enemy has been a stark reminder to us all that conflict is difficult and dangerous. We certainly cannot assume that the conflicts of tomorrow will replicate today's, but we must anticipate a wide range of threats and plan for the requirements necessary to counter them.</p>

<a name="100203-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10020377000081"></a>We have come a long way since our last major defence review in 1998, which gave us the platform to modernise our Armed Forces. Looking forward, we will need to make decisions about the role we want the United Kingdom to play in the world and the capabilities that the Armed Forces need to support that role. We will need to balance those considerations with the financial implications in what will inevitably be a resource-constrained environment.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100203-0003.htm"/>


<a name="100203-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10020377000082"></a>This Green Paper does not attempt to answer those fundamental questions. Instead, it is intended to set out our emerging thinking on the future security environment and other key issues facing defence ahead of the review. While there is no external direct threat to the territorial integrity of the UK, there is a wide range of emerging threats for which we must be prepared. We can work to diminish the threat of international terrorism and to counter the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We can work to prevent emerging threats-for example, by improving our  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>approach to cybersecurity-and to contain and resolve the threat from failing states. We can work to ensure that the impacts of climate change and resource competition are managed peacefully. But my judgment is that conflict and instability in this new age will be an ever-present risk. In the face of these threats, no nation can hope to protect all aspects of national security acting alone. We cannot simply defend from the goal line, and our defence posture must reflect this. In the coming decades, our Armed Forces must be prepared if called upon to protect our interests, often in distant places, and, most likely, as part of a coalition of international forces.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10020377000083"></a>The paper therefore reaches two conclusions. First, that defence must accelerate the process of reform and be able to change swiftly to address new and unforeseen challenges as they emerge. We need to be more adaptable in how we structure, equip, train and generate our Armed Forces. We need a more agile defence organisation. We need more responsive strategic planning. So, today, I am proposing that we should legislate for regular defence reviews to ensure that the Armed Forces continue to adapt rapidly to changing trends and threats.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10020377000084"></a>Secondly, the paper concludes that defence must improve its ability to work in partnership with our key allies and security institutions to make the most of our combined resources. Our alliances and partnerships will become increasingly important and define how successful we will be in meeting the challenges that we face. We strengthen our alliance with the US if we strengthen our position in Europe. We will continue to press our European allies to contribute more to our collective defence effort. But make no mistake: this is not about Europe taking precedence over the US or vice versa. The two are mutually reinforcing relationships. In the UK itself, we need to improve further our partnerships with key Whitehall departments and others to ensure the contribution of our Armed Forces is joined up with our diplomatic and development efforts.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10020377000085"></a>In addition to the conclusions on adaptability and partnership, the paper poses six key strategic questions that the review will need to address. These are: where should we set the balance between focusing on our territory and region and engaging threats at a distance? How far are future conflicts likely to share the characteristics of our engagement in Afghanistan and, therefore, what approach should we take if we employ the Armed Forces to address threats at distance? What contribution should the Armed Forces make in ensuring security and contributing to resilience within the UK? How could we more effectively employ the Armed Forces in support of wider efforts to prevent conflict and strengthen international stability? Do our current international defence and security relationships require rebalancing in the longer term? Should we further integrate our forces with those of key allies and partners?</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10020377000086"></a>Although the defence budget has grown by more than 10 per cent in real terms since 1998 and not a penny will be cut from next year's budget, the forward defence programme faces real financial pressure. We need to rebalance what we do in order to meet our priorities. In December, I began this process; I made a series of decisions to ensure that we found extra resources for vital equipment for Afghanistan. This  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_203"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>included 22 new Chinook helicopters, which will provide necessary strategic lift capability for Afghanistan and for other military operations in the years ahead. However, our commitment to reduce the deficit resulting from the global financial crisis means that future resources across government will be constrained.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10020377000087"></a>The report of Bernard Gray into defence acquisition set out clearly the pressures facing the defence budget. It also set out the importance of improving our procurement processes and addressing the shortfalls in our acquisition systems. The <I>Strategy for Acquisition Reform</I>, published alongside today's Green Paper, sets out how we will tackle the challenges facing this major area of defence expenditure. The major reforms it proposes will deliver enduring change by introducing greater transparency. It will ensure that our equipment plans are efficient, strategically focused, affordable and achievable. But it is not just in equipment acquisition that we will need to do better. We are aiming to deliver efficiency savings of more than £3 billion over the current spending review period. We have a strong programme of work to achieve this, including an independent review into the use of civilians in defence by Gerry Grimstone.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10020377000088"></a>Our biggest capability is our people. We rely on the ability of people, both military and civilian, to deliver defence. We need to attract the best people: highly motivated and highly skilled. Our people have already shown their capacity to adapt to new challenges. We must continue to ensure that the structures and training that support them are fit for purpose, including continuing to strengthen joint approaches across the services.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10020377000089"></a>There has been a great deal of interest and speculation about whether any major capabilities will be confirmed in the Green Paper. This is to misunderstand its purpose. I can say that we do not plan to revisit the conclusions of the 2006 White Paper on the nuclear deterrent. We have committed to a wide range of major capability improvements over the past few years, including most recently signing contracts for two new aircraft carriers; and recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the importance of being able to deploy and sustain significant numbers of highly trained and equipped troops in a variety of roles, including providing the air and aviation support that they require.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10020377000090"></a>Unless the defence review takes us in a very radical new direction, it is the Government's position that these capabilities are likely to remain critical elements of our force structure, but we need to know first what roles and missions we expect our forces to undertake in future before we can take final decisions about the capabilities that they will need. These will be key issues for the defence review.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10020377000091"></a>Let us be clear. Change is needed. There are some tough and important decisions ahead. In my view, we must, as far as possible, put aside our special interests, in politics, in industry and in the services, to take rational decisions that benefit the defence and security of the nation.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10020377000092"></a>In preparing the Green Paper, I consulted widely with academia, across government and with the main opposition parties. I am grateful for the help I received. I should like to thank, in this House, the right honourable

Where the defence of the nation is concerned, we must seek as far as possible to reach consensus on the main issues.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10020377000093"></a>I hope that the Green Paper I am publishing today helps that process and leads to a mature and well-informed debate about the future structure of our Armed Forces.</p>

Of course, our thoughts are with those who have suffered life-changing injuries in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10020377000095"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for repeating the Statement. Over the last few days, I have spoken to a number of defence correspondents and experts, and they all appear to have seen copies of the Green Paper, and a number have attended briefings at the MoD. Why are we the last to have seen the Green Paper?</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10020377000096"></a>We on these Benches largely agree with the findings of the Green Paper, and its related paper on acquisition reform. Both are long overdue, and they will provide a good foundation for any future defence review, regardless of who forms the next Government. The Green Paper does a good job in highlighting the types of threats that we are likely to face in the coming years, especially cyber and space-based threats, and in stressing the importance of winning today's war in Afghanistan. However, there are a few areas of concern that I would like to address.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10020377000097"></a>First is the apparent confusion inside the MoD. Last June we were told that there were no plans for a defence review. In July, the Government announced their plans to hold an SDR. Last December, the Government made cuts to the defence budget, totalling almost £1 billion. This month, we are told that the defence budget will be ring-fenced. On Monday, we learned that 10 Downing Street was briefing that the Government are committed to the two aircraft carriers, the full order of JSF, and tranche 3 of Eurofighter. But Paragraph 9 of the Green Paper clearly states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10020377000184"></a>"We cannot proceed with all the activities and programmes we currently aspire to, while simultaneously supporting our current operations and investing in the new capabilities we need. We will need to make tough decisions".</p>

<p><a name="10020377000177"></a>So who is right, Downing Street or the Ministry of Defence? If anything, it sounds like the Prime Minister has finally decided to fund the 1998 SDR-which, according to Geoff Hoon, was not fully funded to begin with.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10020377000098"></a>There is no doubt that some of the challenges with which our Armed Forces have had to contend have been created by the Government's unwillingness to fund that SDR. As we have recently been hearing from various retired service chiefs and former Defence Ministers at the Chilcot inquiry-and just this morning, Sir Kevin Tebbit spoke of a permanent crisis budget at the MoD because of the Chancellor's cutting of defence expenditure six months after the invasion of Iraq-the "constraints" to which the Green Paper refers are not all externally driven.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10020377000099"></a>The Statement refers to efficiency savings over the current spending review period of some £3 billion. Can the noble Baroness give some indication of how this is to be achieved? Will these savings be directed to the front line, or clawed back by the Treasury? The Green Paper says that the MoD will aim to,</p>
<ul><a name="10020377000194"></a>"improve the ratio of personnel who are available for deployment against overall personnel".</ul>
<p><a name="10020377000178"></a>An example given in the Green Paper is that the Army can only deploy 10,000 soldiers, even though its total strength is more than 100,000. What do the Government have planned to increase the readiness and deployability of our Armed Forces, and to ensure the equipment is available to sustain them on operations? This also includes the use of Reserve Forces in future operations. Does the noble Baroness agree that the Green Paper should have made much more recognition of the importance of and contribution made by the Reserve Forces?</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10020377000100"></a>We support the Government's call for a more agile defence organisation. The challenges that Britain and our Armed Forces face need to be revisited from time to time, so we welcome the intention to incorporate into law the proposal for such a review in each Parliament. This is a Conservative suggestion, so it is especially welcome. We also welcome the announcement in the acquisition reform paper to publish an annual statement on the affordability of the equipment programme.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10020377000101"></a>We agree with the Government that an increasingly uncertain world will require our forces to go overseas. While no one state is identified as a direct strategic threat, we know from recent history that some states see armed force as a tool to be used. Britain must not make the mistake of sending any signals that we are somehow less committed to our values and beliefs, nor that our treaty obligations are now worthless.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10020377000102"></a>We support the Government's contention that defence must improve its ability to work in partnership with our key allies. I particularly praise the efforts of our Danish and Estonian allies who serve alongside our forces in Afghanistan and who I had the privilege to meet when I visited Afghanistan last year. We urge our fellow European members of NATO to increase their efforts in support of the alliance's objectives in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10020377000103"></a>We agree with closer co-operation with France. We should view France as our most important European partner and it only makes sense that we work closely in areas where we have shared sets of interests. Although that was widely reported in the press this morning, there is little evidence of this commitment in the Green Paper. Will the Minister please expand on this commitment in her response? Finally, we look forward, as does the Statement, to seeing a more joined-up approach to defence and security across Whitehall, embracing not just the MoD but the FCO and DfID as well.</p>

<p><a name="10020377000179"></a>Indeed, we are in the defence overstretch that we are in today, militarily and financially, precisely because the Prime Minister, particularly when he was Chancellor, showed little interest in defence and kept the chequebook closed. We know that from the Chilcot inquiry, with the then service chiefs apparently considering resignation; from Geoff Hoon's failure to get funding for more helicopters at that stage; and, more recently, from the comments of John Hutton. Spending on defence has steadily declined under this Government as a percentage of GDP to just over 2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10020377000105"></a>We welcome today's Green Paper and the proposed strategic defence review. We, among others, have long been calling for one, but until recently the Government resisted, saying that it was unnecessary. We are pleased that regular defence reviews are proposed. Today's world is increasingly menacing, not only with concerns on nuclear proliferation, but the newer threats from international terrorism, from cyber assault and piracy. Everyone recognises that we cannot go it alone in the future. We have to work with our allies. No longer have we the resources to be the world's policeman. It has to make much greater sense to co-operate with France, which has a defence spend comparable to our own. Some of us have long argued for this, but little real progress has been made. What specific conclusions came out of the meetings apparently held in London last week by the outgoing French Chief of the Defence Staff? The semi-detached, rather Eurosceptic attitude of the Official Opposition towards mainstream Europe will hardly make serious co-operation with the French any easier, should they form the next Government.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10020377000106"></a>We agree that the complex, brutal conflict in Afghanistan has to be given priority and acknowledge that thankfully most of our forces are now much better equipped. We agree also with the double-A thrust of the Green Paper that our forces need to be more adaptable and more agile. We particularly agree with the need to improve the working arrangements between our Armed Forces and our diplomatic and development activities which are so crucial in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10020377000107"></a>Turning to the strategy for acquisition reform, the reality, as Bernard Gray made so clear, is that we are massively overcommitted. As I have said previously, whatever the undoubted merits of the new carriers, was it sensible to go ahead with them before an SDR and when the MoD is, frankly, broke? The acquisition reform document makes the interesting point that 40 per cent of the £20 billion procurement spend is with just 10 companies. Can the noble Baroness confirm that there are severe penalty clauses in virtually all our major contracts which limit room for cancellation or manoeuvre? I support what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, earlier; could she explain how the figure of £3 billion in efficiency savings has been arrived at by perhaps providing a breakdown? Not before time does the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, say in his foreword that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10020377000186"></a>"At the heart of the strategy is a radical commitment to greater public transparency by publishing annual assessments of the overall affordability of our equipment plans".</p>

<p><a name="10020377000180"></a>The independent audit referred to later is a huge step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10020377000108"></a>Finally, I want to ask two specific questions. First, how concerned are the Government about the recent sacking by Secretary Robert Gates of the marine general in charge of the F-35 programme-the designated aircraft for our aircraft carriers-saying that the Lockheed-Martin programme had been plagued by problems, had failed to hit performance targets and that,</p>
<ul><a name="10020377000195"></a>"key goals and benchmarks were not met"?</ul>
<p><a name="10020377000181"></a>Secondly, will she comment on the story this lunchtime which quoted Sir Jock Stirrup, the current Chief of the Defence Staff, as saying that it was, "quite plausible that there could be a consolidation between two services within the next 10 years". What is the current Government's stance on service consolidation?</p>

This is a significant opportunity to have a mature debate about the issues we will be facing in the future, and the Green Paper sets out clearly both the trends in the world that we have to cope with and the threats that we will have to take on board. While I could not possibly commit the business managers to a debate in this House, I am sure that there will be many opportunities for discussion. It is important that people from as many different backgrounds as possible take part in the debate.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10020377000110"></a>I shall start with the last questions put to me. I have a piece of paper which tells me exactly what Sir Jock Stirrup said earlier. He was asked, "Do you think it is plausible that we will have three armed services?". He said, "Certainly it is plausible". It was the questioner who put forward the idea of only two, and as we are not pre-empting anything that the SDR might provide, we are not denying that anything is a subject for debate. But that was the only context in which the idea was put forward; it was not actively put forward by the Chief of the Defence Staff as something that he wants to see.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10020377000111"></a>On the joint strike force programme, there have been difficulties with this complex programme, but it is also a very exciting one. I will not comment on any internal American decisions with regard to personnel because I do not think that that would be wise.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10020377000112"></a>Many different issues have been raised. It is right that we should highlight cyber threats and the like because while it is difficult to be specific about them, and while the public may hear about them, they do not appear to be particularly tangible. We have to keep the entire range of threat in view when discussing these issues. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned that defence experts and correspondents had been talking about the Green Paper as if they had seen it. To my knowledge, it only went to the printers yesterday and late amendments were made earlier this week. But it is true that we consulted widely before finalising the Green Paper. Seminars with academics were held and the Defence Advisory Forum, of which his honourable friend in another place is a member, was involved. So while there were people who knew what our thinking was, the document was finalised very late in the day.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10020377000113"></a>I take issue with one point made by the noble Lord, Lord Astor. He talked about the announcement made in December, which he described as cuts to the defence budget. That is not the case. The defence budget has not changed at all for this current year. Spending will be £35.4 billion in 2009-10 and will rise to £36.9 billion in 2010-11. That money is ring-fenced. On top of that we have the very substantial contribution the Treasury will be making to operations. What happened last December, as the Secretary of State pointed out earlier today, was actually a realignment to ensure that current priorities were met. I think that was the right decision. As has already been mentioned, the lead time for many of the procurement projects is extremely long and that sometimes makes it difficult to adapt to what we need. That is one of the issues that we are trying to face in this Green Paper.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10020377000114"></a>We have said for some considerable time that our Armed Forces have to be more adaptable, flexible and responsive. It is also incumbent on industry and the MoD to be more adaptable, flexible and responsive. When we talk what I think the Green Paper calls a "spiral approach" to contracting-I would call it more an incremental approach-that is probably one of the aspects we have to bear in mind in the future.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10020377000115"></a>We actually have quite a good track record in terms of making efficiency savings within the MoD. Gerry Grimstone is conducting an inquiry; we think it right to bring in external people for this occasionally. It is important that we step up to the mark. I think that we probably can be doing that.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10020377000116"></a>I was very grateful for the acknowledgment that the equipment that we have on operations is so impressive. Everybody involved in operations-the military, the civilians who have been helping, the contractors and industry-has worked exceptionally well together to make sure that our record on the delivery of urgent operational requirements has been very impressive. Some of our allies are wondering how we have been able to achieve that level of flexibility; they have been looking at our procedures and the way that we do things. It is good that we recognise the changes that have been made there.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10020377000117"></a>I am glad that there has been general welcome for the idea of legislation to make sure that we have timely strategic defence reviews. I also welcome what has been said about the need to make sure that all departments link in together. We hear a great deal about the comprehensive approach and it is extremely important to operations. It is also extremely important to our long-term planning. One of our objectives is conflict prevention-how we use our defence diplomacy or what might be called "soft power" before we have a problem to influence areas of the world that are extremely difficult. We do that working with our allies.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10020377000118"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned the Danes and the Estonians. I, too, have met people from those countries; they have been extremely good allies, working well with us on operations and, indeed, suffering significant casualties. We should be happy to recognise the closeness of that relationship and pay tribute to the work that has been done there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10020377000119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned that the outgoing French Chief of Defence staff had been over here recently. The chiefs of defence staff do meet from time to time-when they change over, when they have conferences or whatever. We have a lot of engagement with the French as we do with the Americans and many other countries-at CHOG level, but also at ministerial and other official levels. It is quite right that we should do so and that we should see how we can co-operate.</p>

<a name="100203-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10020377000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned the discussions about working closely with the French. In the Green Paper we make it clear that we want to work within NATO, within the EU and also have bilateral arrangements. The fact that France has now rejoined the military side of NATO helps and is leading to more discussions of the kind to which we were referring earlier. It is the case, of course, that in the defence budgets that Governments have in European countries, only we and the French are big spenders. So it is right to see what we can do there, although, as we have said on previous occasions, collaboration on equipment can be very difficult, because of the alignment of so many factors. However, it is worth thinking about a long time in advance so that we know in which direction we are going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10020377000121"></a>I was asked whether it was sensible to have the carriers before the strategic defence review. You could argue that on a whole range of equipment, but we can never stand still in making those decisions. We have to make sensible decisions and try not to pre-empt the final outcome of a strategic defence review.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para1"></a>

I notice that the Americans are once again embarking on their four-year defence review. I welcome that change, particularly because the circumstances have changed enormously since 1998, when there was no involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq as we have now. There is no question that the current financial situation of the Ministry of Defence is the worst mess it has ever been in anybody's recent experience. So the challenge is very great.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10020377000124"></a>I agree with one thing very much. When we have our forces engaged in dangerous circumstances, they must have total priority. That is a welcome change after eight years in which they were not given the priority for the equipment. The Secretary of State's Statement mentions the helicopters for which we have placed an order, but they will not be available for the next two years, when we urgently need them now.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10020377000125"></a>On the Minister's last comment, to say that the decision on the carriers and the fighter aircraft does not pre-empt the rest of the defence review does not make much sense. The following paragraph in the Statement to the paragraph that describes the issue of the carriers being determined appears to reopen the subject. I should be grateful if she would clarify that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10020377000126"></a>In the kindest way, may I say that, when somebody comes to consider the results of this review, it would be very helpful if we did not have an annual change in the Secretary of State for Defence, as we have had in the past five years? Whichever Government are in power, I hope that the person in charge will be someone with some real experience in defence and will be allowed to stay there for a reasonable length of time so that they can carry this thing through. It is simply not fair to our Armed Forces or to all those involved in the defence of our country to have this continual change at the top.</p>

I looked at the statistics on the gaps between defence reviews in the past and that is not dramatically unusual. There has been an update as well, from time to time. When we were involved in such operations as Iraq and Afghanistan, perhaps that was not time to take a full defence review, which is why we had the updating papers on that. Certainly the circumstances are very different from 1998, although I noticed that there is a paragraph in the defence review published in July 1998 that says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10020377000187"></a>"There is an increasing danger from the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical technologies. As Iraq has amply demonstrated, such regimes threaten not only their neighbours but vital economic interests and even international stability".</p>

<p><a name="10020377000182"></a>So there was some anticipation of some of the problems that later came to dominate, although I do not think that it was anticipated exactly how.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10020377000128"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord acknowledges the priority that I referred to for equipment. We should all welcome the reports that have been made about equipment on operations. Members from this House and the Select Committee in another House have talked about the very significant movement on equipment. It is not a question of buying equipment off the shelf; it has taken a great deal of effort on the part of everyone involved, industry included, to upgrade and make the changes that have been made.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10020377000129"></a>In terms of carriers and equipment, we have a dilemma. I can either stand here, take one project at a time and say, "Yes, we are going to do that after the review, no we are not going to do that", or I can say, "I am not saying anything about any of them". The whole point of the review is to consider what you need for the future. The statements we have made have been on the basis of our assessment at the moment. If, as I said in repeating the Statement, there was a radical change of approach as a result of that review, then it might be that other changes would be necessary.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10020377000130"></a>In terms of the annual change, as the noble Lord called it, of the Secretary of State for Defence, I do think it is unfortunate that we have not had the level of continuity that perhaps would have been liked. However, the current Secretary of State for Defence has been a Minister in that department for a considerable time and has the respect of all those who work in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10020377000132"></a>I should like to be clear on one thing. Although the Minister may be technically correct in saying, "not a penny will be cut from next year's budget", is it not true that because of the current Ministry of Defence overspend-caused, largely unavoidably, by overspill from operational requirements in Afghanistan and the inclusion of certain items of equipment, some for political reasons, for which proper strategic decisions on capability have not yet been made-at this very moment the Treasury is clawing back from defence's cash flow no less than £1 billion in this first year? This money has to be found from somewhere, and usually involves considerable penalties, particularly in the longer term.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10020377000133"></a>Finally, as economy of effort is one of the principles of war, how would the Minister actually measure affordability, much mentioned in the Green Paper? Presumably with defence of the realm and security, this country can afford what it believes it truly needs. Is the intention merely to leave it to the Treasury to come up with less money than the year before?</p>

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="10020377000134"></a><b><a name="100203-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10020377000306"></a>Baroness Taylor of Bolton:</b> My Lords, I acknowledge the deep experience that the noble and gallant Lord brings to this debate and I am flattered that he thinks that some of my comments were sensible. He was right when he used the word security as well as defence. These days, it is extremely difficult to draw a line between defence and security, and the Green Paper makes it clear that much of what we have been thinking about looks to the national security strategy which has been drawn up recently.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10020377000135"></a>However, I disagree with the noble and gallant Lord about the money. It is a straightforward fact that in 2009-10 the ring-fenced budget from the Treasury to the Ministry of Defence was £35.4 billion. The ring-fenced budget for 2010-11 is £36.9 billion. There are no cuts, and the Treasury is increasing its contribution from the reserve for operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10020377000136"></a>There is still, and there always will be, a question of affordability. That is one of the reasons why it is important that we have a discussion about the Strategic Defence Review in the context of the challenges we face throughout the world. That is also why it is important that the Green Paper sets out those changes and trends that are taking place in the international arena and refers to the specific threats we are facing. At the end of the day, we will as a country have to make decisions about affordability.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10020377000139"></a>Much will be made about resources, and none of the potential governments looking for support in the coming general election will find it comfortable to make those choices in the Ministry of Defence. But it is important to bear in mind that, since the last Strategic Defence Review that I supervised in 1998, the defence budget has increased in real terms by 10 per cent, and if one takes into account the money devoted to operations, by more than 24 per cent. Every single urgent operational requirement has been met by Her Majesty's Treasury. That is an important component part of where we are, but where we are going to be will depend on a number of tough decisions that have yet to be made.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10020377000140"></a>I want to make two points to my noble friend. First, we must re-emphasise constantly the fact that in future this nation will not be able to deploy a full spectrum of capabilities. In future, in dealing with myriad challenges and threats, we will have to do things with others, especially with our European allies in NATO and the European Union. That must be seen as part of a practical policy going forward.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10020377000141"></a>Finally, I disagree with the Government in one respect in this exercise. I do not believe that we should have a Strategic Defence Review in isolation. We need a strategic security review that looks at the security of this nation and involves the Foreign Office, the Department for International Development, the Home Office and elsewhere in order to establish what the priorities really are and what important part defence will play in that overall strategy.</p>

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="10020377000142"></a><b><a name="100203-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10020377000308"></a>Baroness Taylor of Bolton:</b> First, I repeat what was said in another place and thank my noble friend for his contribution to the Defence Advisory Forum. My noble friend's credentials in this matter are well known and important. He is right when he reminds us of the priority of Afghanistan. That comes out of the Green Paper and from the Statement made in another place earlier today. The work that we have done there has been quite remarkable in terms of getting everybody to work together, including other government departments. This country probably invented the term "the comprehensive approach", and bearing in mind my noble friend's last point, it is important that we keep that in mind in all discussions. I agree that it has been beneficial for the Defence Advisory Forum to take a long view and act in a non-partisan way. One of the Green Paper's strengths is that it is analytical and not partisan. That is one of the reasons why I am hopeful that we can have that kind of long-term approach. This is extremely timely because other countries are thinking about what they should be doing and NATO is undertaking its strategic review. I am sure that there will be a lot of interest in what we have been saying.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10020377000143"></a>We all acknowledge that decisions about resources will not be easy. Nobody is talking about committing to increasing spending, but it is important to recognise, as my noble friend did, the significant contributions from the Treasury on top of the core defence budget.

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10020377000144"></a>My noble friend mentioned a disagreement about the actual wording and asked whether we should not have a Strategic Defence and Security Review rather than a Strategic Defence Review. That was something that we picked up on rather late in the day. As I said earlier, the distinction these days between defence and security is extremely blurred. Throughout this document we make reference to the national security strategy because we have made the psychological leap that the two are so well connected. However, we have not put it on the front of the document. I assure him that the point has been registered and is well understood by many people in the department.</p>

Does she agree that, if we require our Armed Forces to protect our interests often in foreign parts-I am quoting from the Statement, and a quick look at Annex A provides graphic justification for those words-then it is imperative that we retain elite specialist amphibious troops, embarked in commando ships with carrier-borne aircraft, surface vessels and submarines in support. This sort of task force, often working with allies, provides our country with its greatest flexibility. Using that platform, we can run the gamut of operations from humanitarian to all-out combat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10020377000147"></a>I am very pleased that the noble Lord was able to draw attention to Appendix A, which I recommend that people look at. It explains the whole range of operations that our Armed Forces have been involved in. It does not list them all but it does, as he says, go from armed conflict to humanitarian. The range is vast. People may well be surprised by the number of operations because very often they are carried out very quietly and they do not get the public acclamation that perhaps they deserve.</p>

Everybody acknowledges the work of the TA. We have seen from operations recently that it has very often been in the front line. I am afraid we have had casualties and deaths among the TA. Very often it has been able to provide niche capabilities where there might otherwise be a shortage. We acknowledge the work that goes on. We do think that if TA soldiers are to be deployed then training is absolutely essential. We welcome and have been looking at the links that the TA have with the mainstream, full-time Army. It is important that we continue to do that.</p>

I very much welcome the Green Paper and suggest that perhaps the most important point in it concerns bipartisanship. This is a great breakthrough and, given the contributions of the noble Lords, Lord Astor, Lord Lee, Lord King, and others, I think that she has buy-in from this House. I wonder whether my noble friend could take this a stage further. I have long felt that defence should be much more bipartisan, but I find it strange that the Executive take the decision and that legislators, who really are able to represent bipartisanship, are often excluded. In moving forward, can my noble friend think of ways in which we could involve parliamentarians in this process because the buy-in of parliamentarians would help the buy-in of citizens and would help our military forces?</p>

I know that he has been involved in defence for many years, having been our spokesman on this issue when we were in opposition. He is right to emphasise the need for bipartisanship on an issue as important as this. He asks how legislators could be more involved. I think that it is up to the House to make that decision. As I said earlier, as a former Chief Whip I would hate any Minister to make a commitment about debates, but were there to be a debate on this topic, it would be very welcome.

That is new and is something in which I think parliamentarians will take a great deal of interest.</p>

This amendment deals with the issue of dual mandates, which was clearly a matter of concern on Second Reading and in Committee. I am sure that the debate this afternoon will give another clear indication, if one were needed, that this issue remains important.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10020377000158"></a>I think it would be appropriate if I briefly mention the political process before turning to the detail of the amendments before us today. The Hillsborough talks established by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach last week have now continued for eight days. With good political will, we believe that the parties should soon be able to reach a reasonable agreement.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10020377000159"></a>Turning to the amendments, I listened carefully to the debate in Grand Committee and undertook to reflect on the issues raised by noble Lords. Since Grand Committee we have drafted two amendments that I believe are an appropriate way of using this Bill to address the issue of dual mandates and that offer a reasonable compromise.</p>

<a name="100203-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10020377000160"></a>The amendments tabled in my name would mean that if a salary is payable to an MLA as a Member of either House of Parliament or as a Member of the European Parliament, he or she will not receive a salary as an MLA. This would mean that politicians are unable to benefit financially purely as a result of being elected to two legislatures. The reduction in salary would take effect as soon as the Bill's provisions are commenced: it is not predicated upon the establishment of the independent body. The amendments would also have an effect on pensions. For any period when an MLA's salary is reduced to zero, he or she will not accrue pension benefits. The amendment would apply only to salaries, not allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10020377000161"></a>I believe that consensus is of particular importance today. It is important in relation to the talks that will continue this afternoon at Hillsborough and it is important in relation to the issues that we are debating in this House. As I said at the outset, the Government believe that these amendments offer a basis for consensus. Sending a message that we in this House are able to reach agreement on this sensitive issue of dual mandates would be most valuable. I beg to move.</p>

She indicated in Grand Committee that she was listening to the mood of the House. The mood then, and before that at Second Reading, was clear. The issue of double mandates-or double-jobbing as it is known in the Province-is a potent one. Of the 18 MPs who Northern Ireland constituencies send to Westminster, 15 are also Members of the Assembly-16 before Strangford became vacant. The problems inherent in such a doubling-up of roles are well known, and the noble Baroness has rightly taken account of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10020377000163"></a>In Grand Committee, the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, made the pertinent remark that far too little new political talent comes out of Northern Ireland because the seats are already occupied. I made the point in Committee that the demands of the parliamentary timetable mean that it is unlikely that an MLA can be an MP at the same time effectively. Regardless of how dedicated they might be, the positions simply demand too much to be combined in one person.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10020377000164"></a>These are not new arguments and the parties here and in Stormont are all familiar with them. All parties agree that the practice should come to an end. The Kelly report, which the Government have committed themselves to implementing, strongly recommends an end to the practice of double-jobbing. We on these Benches, along with our partners in the UUP, took the view that there was no good reason to put it off until 2015. We had an opportunity in this Bill to do something about double-jobbing, so we tabled our amendments in Grand Committee. Those amendments are still on the Marshalled List today.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10020377000165"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for having the courage to concede the point by bringing forward her own amendments. That is not to say that I think the Government's proposals are perfect. My brief says that the amendments are silent on allowances. I think that is wrong and that the noble Baroness explained where allowances fitted in. However, a little clarity when she sums up would be helpful. The noble Baroness explained that if an MLA is also an MP, he still has constituents to serve, even if he is not getting both salaries, and therefore needs his allowance to be continued. Noble Lords will be aware of the view that the public take of politicians' allowances and expenses. I wonder if the new dispensation under the Government's proposals will escape the public's notice or meet with a little warmth. My brief also says that the Government's amendments do not mention pensions. However, the noble Baroness did mention pensions and I am quite clear where the Government stand on pensions. I thank her for that clarification.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10020377000166"></a>Having looked at what the Government's amendments do not deal with, I will now turn to what they do. Amendment 1 deals with MLAs who are also MPs and who are eligible to receive a Westminster salary. If a person falls into that category-and not all MPs from Northern Ireland are eligible to take a Westminster salary-his MLA salary will drop to zero, although a separate salary is still payable if he is a Minister in the Assembly. Therefore, he will receive his full Back-Bench MP's salary, expenses and allowances for Westminster, Stormont administrative allowances, and possibly a ministerial salary. The noble Baroness expects that the disincentive of losing the Stormont MLA salary will be enough to encourage a double-jobber to step down from one legislature or the other. That, at least, is her hope. It is the intention of our amendments to make it clear that future Governments will not tolerate double-jobbing in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10020377000167"></a>Our Amendment 2, which I moved in Committee, would go further. It would withhold all salary and expenses from an MLA until he stepped down as an MP. It was not-and I wish to make this clear in the light of some criticism of the amendment in Grand Committee-ever designed to dictate to the electorate who they could and could not vote for. Our amendment, like the Government's, is an incentive. It is a firmer incentive than the Government are offering, but we are both looking to reach the same ends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10020377000168"></a>Our approach has never been to single out one party for favour or discrimination, but has been one of principle. We wish to see the constituents of Northern Ireland properly and fully represented in all the forums in which they are entitled to be. We wish to see a fair and wise use of public funds to remunerate the elected representatives. It is because we have held fast to those principles that I tabled the amendments in Grand Committee, retabled them on Report and was prepared to test the will of the House on them. I believe that the mood of the House was behind those principles. However, the Government have tabled their amendments and we must give them due consideration. I have already said that they are not perfect, and explained why; but I recognise that the noble Baroness and the Government have made an effort to meet us. She and her colleagues, here and in another place, are genuine in seeking the same ends as we do, which will benefit Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10020377000169"></a>I told the noble Baroness in Grand Committee that I would not relish the prospect of defeating the Government on a Northern Ireland issue. We on these Benches have at all times sought to be helpful to the Government when dealing with Northern Ireland. We have engaged with them constructively and in a spirit of bipartisanship; and over the years that I have been doing this job, I have made many friends on the government Benches, as I hope the noble Baroness will agree. I wish to continue to do so, and because I recognise the work that the noble Baroness and her officials have done, I will support her amendments and will not press those in my name. However, I will make one final short comment. I will remind the Minister's noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, of his time in Northern Ireland, when he was one of

I will politely ask him to cast his mind back and remember the dangers of attempting to play party politics at Westminster with Northern Ireland.</p>

I thank the Leader of the House for her introduction. She mentioned the contemporary political context of the Hillsborough negotiations. The Bill may be of only academic interest if there is no agreement at those talks between the DUP and Sinn Fein. It is also ironic that we are discussing double-jobbing when the MLAs are performing so badly at single-jobbing and are not getting on with settling their outstanding differences.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10020377000171"></a>According to today's <I>Irish Times</I><I>,</I> Peter Robinson is finding extreme difficulty in getting enough support from within his own party. These intra-party differences are a microcosm of the wider splits in the ranks of unionism, and all seriously obstruct the proper workings of the devolutionary settlement, which is now in extreme jeopardy. I hope that I am proved wrong about that. When the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, suspended Stormont some years ago and everybody thought it was for a short time, I said that it would be for a very long time. It was for five years. I hope that my prognostications now will not prove as accurate as they were then.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10020377000172"></a>The Government have attempted to address the problem of double-jobbing. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, they have not gone as far as we would like, or as the Kelly report advised when it said that two or more mandates were not advisable. We have seen that starkly today. So many MLAs are also MPs and they cannot concentrate their minds on the real business at hand, but one must accept it. If an electorate wants to have a representative in more than one forum, that should be its right; but it should not be encouraged.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10020377000173"></a>We went along with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, at Second Reading and in Committee, and I added my name to his amendment. We demonstrated to the Leader of the House how strongly we felt on that issue. I am extremely grateful that the Minister has gone as far as she has in proposing her amendment. I associate myself with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and would not seek to divide the House; we will accept the government amendment.</p>

First, as I have seen close-up, it accords strongly with the mood of the people in Northern Ireland. The parties have recognised that-some more readily than others-by their acceptance of the principle. Secondly, and perhaps even more fundamentally, it has become very clear over time and underlined by the present crisis, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, has said, that there is a need in Northern Ireland political life for wise heads and minds focused on the affairs of the Province. If these provisions succeed in encouraging such a focus, it will redound to the strength of the political process, which needs all the strength it can get, and the durability of the institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10020386000002"></a>Many have criticised the Assembly structure as being seriously and fundamentally flawed. I understand those criticisms very clearly and share many of them myself. However, I quote the old saying that the best is the enemy of the good. I have no doubt that stability in Northern Ireland is assisted by the existence of a functioning and durable Assembly with all its flaws. Even a poor Assembly is better than no Assembly. If this Bill achieves that, it will be for the public benefit.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10020386000003"></a>It is right that the provision should be put into effect without delay. There has been some foot-dragging in the process and those who would like to have deferred it coming into effect for quite a long time-indeed, a number of years-should be resisted. Those who dragged their feet are perhaps like St Augustine, who in his famous prayer said:</p>

In effect, she has moved, in substance, to deal with the issues which were raised-there could be a quarrel about some detail but very little. It is a substantial shift and we are very grateful indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10020386000005"></a>I want to say why this government amendment is so necessary. On Monday this week in the other place, there was a debate on Afghanistan. In that debate, you could hear the accents of every region of the United Kingdom-Scottish, Welsh, Midlands, south of England and north of England-but no Northern Irish voice. That is not the fault of the Members of Parliament, most of whom, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has said, are also Members of the Assembly. That is why the issue old double-jobbing is so crucial. We in this House all accept that they had important business in Belfast and at Hillsborough which required their attention. Indeed, the double-jobbing situation is an accident of a complicated peace process and no reflection on any individual, but it is now time to move away from that system.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10020386000006"></a>None the less, it reveals a fundamental point, because the people of Northern Ireland contribute to the war in Afghanistan, as do all the other regions of the United Kingdom. Young men from Northern Ireland fall in that conflict, as do young men from Scotland, Wales and England. It is a fundamental issue that the opinions and the tones of their Members of Parliament are heard when these issues come up.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10020386000007"></a>This problem relates not only to defence issues, but to broader United Kingdom policy issues-economic, social and national security-on which in recent times, because of the domestic pressures that exist in Northern Ireland, we have not heard Northern Irish voices at Westminster. We need to make a break from that-we need to make a break quickly-and the provisions that the noble Baroness is advancing today are part of that work.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10020386000008"></a>For the health of democracy throughout the United Kingdom, we need to create a condition in which the voices of all the regions are heard in our Parliament on matters that affect all the regions of the United

I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for doing that. We have had a situation that the mastery of two or three themes of the current sectarian debate in Northern Ireland could put an individual into the Assembly and into the Westminster Parliament. No mastery of any other political issue is required. That again is something we have to make a break from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10020386000009"></a>We need to move forward in the context of Northern Ireland, and I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for her proposals which will help to do that and to bring new people into politics.</p>

However, I declare at the outset that I am a Member of that much-maligned Northern Ireland Assembly which, in the opinion of some, is not doing its single job very well. That criticism is ill founded. This House should just stop and take stock.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10020386000011"></a>The Northern Ireland Assembly has delivered much good for Northern Ireland, despite the criticism that easily falls from the lips of some today. Those who stand in this House today and criticise have very little knowledge of the past 35 years that Northern Ireland has come through. I emphasise that we needed the experience of parliamentarians from the House of Commons to give guidance in the early years of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and I hope and pray that the Northern Ireland Assembly will continue to exist.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10020386000012"></a>There is no doubt that there are difficulties, but I believe that with good will those difficulties can and will be overcome, despite the scepticism of some here today. I suspect, unfortunately, that there are those who would like to see the demise of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I do not have a lot of problems with what the Minister has said today. They are all noble targets and my party has already put forward very constructive ways of taking this issue forward. We will not be making any issue that the Government are trying to, for instance, short-change the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10020386000013"></a>Let us not forget that those who are double-mandated went to the people and were elected. I do not accept for a moment that there are seats in Northern Ireland that are continually filled. Those seats, at any election are declared vacant for each and every person who wishes to put their names forward. The people declare, they make their decision and return whom they will on the ballot paper. I ask noble Lords to take that into consideration. Having said that, I understand the comments from around this House today; I understand where the Minister is coming from and I do not have a lot of problems with anything that has been proposed here.</p>

It was a two-way situation; sometimes, having listened to a case the Floor of the other place, they could convey the argument to the Assembly, and vice versa. However, I accept now that we must move on.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10020386000016"></a>Sometimes in Scotland and Wales, at a general election an Assembly Member is elected to the Westminster Parliament. Those who are in opposition to that Member's party might then say, "We want a by-election". Sometimes, a by-election can cost the taxpayers a great deal. Also, all sorts of people can come out of the woodwork and say that they have a great affiliation to a certain community when they do not, but are just trying to win a by-election. Therefore, if an Assembly Member wins a seat at a general election, there is a case for keeping both posts but not necessarily both salaries. I would certainly support the amendment.</p>

Before I turn to the amendments tabled by other noble Lords, perhaps I might answer some of the points that have been made in this short but interesting and useful debate.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10020386000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was absolutely right when he outlined the situation on allowances and ministerial pay. Allowances will continue to be paid because we believe that while double-jobbing continues-and some people may still wish to represent two constituencies-people should be able to serve both of their constituencies while they are the Member for them, and should therefore receive the requisite allowances. However, as the noble Lord said, we hope that ensuring that politicians are not able to benefit financially, purely as a result of being elected to two legislatures, will act as a sort of a catalyst for them ultimately to choose which constituency they wish to serve. As the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Morrow, said, the electorate clearly have a role to play in whether they wish people to serve in two constituencies.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10020386000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned party politics and asked me to take a message to my noble friend. I believe that we must remain non-partisan on issues pertaining to Northern Ireland, as do all of my honourable and noble friends. We believe that it should continue as it always has continued.</p>

I also hope that his earlier prognostications do not come to pass now because, like the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, I am sure we would all agree that we want the talks to continue and succeed. Yes, we want to finish the job of devolution, but we also believe that the Assembly itself is doing a good job and want it to continue for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10020386000022"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, for pointing out that the amendments accord with the mood of politics and the parties in Northern Ireland, and I am glad that he believes that the

I assure him that there will be no more foot-dragging because, as I mentioned earlier, the reduction in salary will take effect as soon as the Bill's provisions are commenced.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10020386000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, as ever, makes a very persuasive case for getting rid of double-jobbing. He is right to say that the voice of the elected representatives of Northern Ireland must be heard in both Chambers of our Parliament on matters that affect all regions and nations of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10020386000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morrow, was right to point out why we have double-jobbing and why it was necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, who has great experience, explained how we have benefited from it in the past.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10020386000025"></a>The effect of the amendments tabled in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Smith of Clifton, would be that any new provision on salaries and allowances made by the independent body must ensure that MLAs who were paid allowances or a salary as an MP or MEP would be unable to claim their MLA salary or allowances. The Assembly would also be under a duty to amend its existing determinations dealing with salary and allowances to make such provision. I believe that the intention would be to prevent people performing both roles. Without the office costs allowance, which pays for constituency offices, MLAs would not be able to represent their constituents effectively. Therefore, the Government are concerned about the amendments because, as I said in Committee, it is our view that the best way forward is for the political parties in Northern Ireland to come to an agreement about how to bring dual mandates to a close.</p>

<a name="100203-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10020386000026"></a>The Government also have practical concerns about how these amendments would work. They are drafted in such a way as to be somewhat ambiguous as to their effect. Furthermore, there is a prospect of MLAs with a dual mandate being returned to the Assembly at the next election, which is scheduled for 2011, but finding early in the new mandate that they are unable to represent their constituents properly because they may become unable to claim the office costs allowance. We believe that there is an inherent risk in these amendments. As our compromise solution indicates, we have a large degree of sympathy with the principle behind the opposition amendments, but the manner in which they attempt to achieve their objective is unacceptable. However, I am delighted that both noble Lords have signalled their intention to agree with the Government's amendments.</p>

The period of six months that it specifies is not set in stone. The important point is to establish for how long the Minister envisages these orders being in effect. It would make sense for there to be a statutory time limit. If the appointed manager cannot remedy the failure in, say, six months or a year, it may well be impossible to solve the problem. This gives rise to the question of what the core role of the manager will be. The six or 12-month period should be adequate if the main role is to ensure the proper running of the registration of domain names and to ensure that abuses in registering names are stopped, rather than to look after the financial health of the registry. This amendment, or a similar one, would reassure those who are concerned that these powers should not allow a Government to step in permanently via the back door, using the excuse of a serious failure to carry out, in essence, nationalisation. I beg to move.</p>

The order could still be running after a registry changes its constitution and could be made up in very many different ways-it could be quite difficult for any directors who are left in place if the manager is foisted on them for a very long time. There may be issues of corporate governance and other company law, which may have to be complied with and which the manager may not be specifically tasked with, so there could be conflicts of interest in running the company. Section 450 of the Companies Act, the duties of directors, stakeholders and other interests all have to be taken into account, so there should be some sort of time limit to sharpen people's minds.</p>

The amendment would artificially limit to six months the time that is available to the manager to remedy the failure of a registry. I assure the noble Lord that the Secretary of State would have no interest whatever in keeping the manager in place any longer than was strictly necessary to complete this task, but there might be circumstances in which more than six months were required.

Will the Minister take into consideration the pay of the manager-or indeed, possibly managers-whom the person will be replacing, or will the new manager be paid on public servant scales? The power to reclaim the remuneration from the registry makes the sum which is decided potentially more controversial than it might otherwise be. This in turn raises again the issue of what the Government see as the function of the new manager, which I referred to when we discussed the previous amendment. Will his role be more one of ensuring that domain registry ceases to abuse its position, or more that of the traditional company doctor? This will have a bearing on the remuneration package, on which the shareholders or beneficiaries of the registry might have strong views. I beg to move.</p>

The clause allows for the order to include these steps. Further, the Bill is clear that the purpose of the manager's appointment is to secure that the steps identified by the Secretary of State are taken. We want the shortest possible intervention necessary to restore the efficient and effective functioning of the domain name and organisation. That is our clear intention, and I hope that in the light of this assurance, the noble Lord will feel capable of withdrawing the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="100203114000011"></a>Amendment 228A would make it a requirement on the face of the Bill to ensure that the manager limited his actions to ensuring that the registry remedied the failure, and any consequences of the failure, which have been set out in the order appointing the manager. Those are the two explicit circumstances in relation to the role-ensuring that the registry remedies the failure, and any consequences of the failure. I can further assure the Committee that the Secretary of State would have no interest whatever in the manager doing anything other than correcting the failure of the registry. The clause already makes it clear that the manager is being appointed solely for the purpose of securing that the registry takes the steps that the Secretary of State considers appropriate to remedy the failure.</p>

This amendment seeks to limit the authority of the appointed manager to deal with the rectification of a specific problem or problems. It would not be desirable or justifiable for the appointed manager to involve himself in matters which are not related to the task for which he was appointed to carry out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="100203114000015"></a>As the Bill is drafted it could be interpreted that once the manager is appointed, he could extend his activities into all sorts of areas which might have nothing to do with the problem he had been appointed to deal with. Since the Secretary of State will already have identified the matters for concern, there should be no need for the manager to have discretion to wander into areas that were not intended. If, on carrying out his appointed role, the manager finds that he needs to extend his activities, there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State from issuing a further order or orders to extend the remit of the manager.</p>

As it reads at the moment, should the manager have to go in and sort things out, there is provision for the registry's directors to be prevented from exercising any of those functions. One can rightly see why one might want to restrain them from interfering, but it would seem to be all or nothing. I should like to insert the words "any of" the registry's directors so that they can select, because one or two of the directors may have expertise in a particular area that could assist and not obstruct the manager. Giving the Minister the discretion to pick and choose among the directors, although he can still restrain all of them if he wishes to, gives much more flexibility to this clause. I beg to move.</p>

In many, perhaps even most organisations, each director, especially the executive ones, carries out a different role. It is possible that some of the directors may still be of value to the appointed person in his role in the registry when the others are no longer required. It would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater to insist that they, too, must be excluded because of their less helpful colleagues. There is also the matter of continuity. Getting rid of everyone at the top without a proper handover period might create problems.</p>

It was pointed out to me that should there be an appeal and the courts end up taking an interest, the issue will probably have got quite complex and could be tricky-there could be points of law and all sorts of things involved. If this then involves the removal of the powers of the directors or even the directors themselves, they would not be able to appeal as members of the company any more, and there could be difficulties. It was therefore felt that it would be wiser to have such an appeal or whatever held at High Court level, where there is the expertise to consider things properly, rather than at county court level. A county court judgment might still be good but might be less considered; I am given to understand that there would be a problem appealing from it. Again, this amendment seeks to help the Minister so that, if things come to these dire straits, there is a better outcome overall.</p>

<a name="100203-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10020386000057"></a>First, I should point out that the amendment will create an anomaly between England and Scotland, where in the case of the latter the sheriff-the equivalent of a county court-will retain jurisdiction. This definition of the court is derived from the Companies Act 2006. In that case, Parliament chose to give jurisdiction to both the High Court and the county court. An effect of this amendment would be to appear to put domain registries in a different category from all other companies.</p>

<a name="100203-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10020386000058"></a>I assure the noble Earl that no prejudice to registries would occur were the Secretary of State to apply for directions to the county court rather than to the High Court. Indeed, as he is no doubt aware, the Civil Procedure Rules give a wide discretion for a case to be transferred from the county court to the High Court if necessary. Furthermore, it may be considered a waste of resources to require every application to be made to the High Court.</p>

Channel 4's existing remit is set out in Section 265 of the Communications Act which, as it is unamended by this Bill, will therefore remain in force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10020386000062"></a>Subsection (3) of Clause 265 states that Channel 4 programming will be that which,</p>
<ul><a name="10020386000110"></a>"appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society".</ul>
<p><a name="10020386000093"></a>The new remit, however, says that, "taken as a whole", Channel Four Television Corporation must appeal to a culturally diverse society. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain how these two slightly different definitions will work in practice. Does it mean that Channel 4, the licensed channel, will continue to do this type of programming, but other output on digital channels or the internet would be released from this possibly expensive obligation?</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10020386000063"></a>Amendment 233ZA would ensure that, under this new remit, Channel 4 will continue to meet its existing public service obligations on its core channel. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee that the new remit will not give licence to the downgrading of Channel 4 public service programming. Various commentators have already questioned the quality of some Channel 4 programmes. While not seeking to dictate what is and is not appropriate, it is important to remember that Channel 4 is a public service broadcaster and any further downgrading would be unacceptable. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment, which deletes the phrase "taken as a whole", arguably requires all such content to appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society. We consider the crucial question is whether Channel 4C's content viewed in the round meets the test. Requiring every single programme to meet the test is surely unduly restrictive.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10020386000065"></a>For example, the new functions include a specific requirement for Channel 4C to provide,</p>
<ul><a name="10020386000111"></a>"relevant media content that appeals to the tastes and interests of older children and young adults".</ul>
<p><a name="10020386000094"></a>Such content might well not appeal to older audiences. I heard what the noble Lord was suggesting and I want to disavow entirely any suggestion that this is about downgrading. It is recognising that certain programmes cannot meet the universal test when they are directed at particular audiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10020386000066"></a>On Amendment 233ZA, the Bill contains no provisions affecting the existing statutory requirements for the Channel 4 television service, nor will it alter any of Channel 4's licence obligations. Subsection (a) of Amendment 233ZA is therefore redundant. We are not about the businesses of changing the remit-the legislation under which Channel 4 meets its obligations.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10020386000067"></a>As for subsection (b) of Amendment 233ZA, the Government recognise the concerns expressed at Second Reading largely on the Liberal Benches that the new Channel 4C functions should not lead to any dilution of public service provision on the Channel 4 television service. The noble Lord has echoed that today. I want to give reassurances on that. This legislation is not about downgrading the output of Channel 4.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10020386000068"></a>Channel 4, like the other commercial public service broadcasters, is largely dependent on advertising revenue to fund its public service content. As all Members of the Committee will know, that revenue has been under significant pressure in recent years as a result of structural changes in the communications market aggravated by the economic downturn. Throughout this period, Channel 4 has continued to meet its public service obligations, though with a reduced content budget.</p>

I want to meet the anxiety on the Lib Dem Benches and those of the Official Opposition. That is not our purpose. However, to require Channel 4 to ensure current levels of provision, irrespective of any future developments, is not reasonable or practical. Both Ofcom's review of public service broadcasting and the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper made clear that, if Channel 4 is to continue to play a significant public service role in the future, it will need to do so beyond the narrow confines of a single, linear television channel. I am sure that the noble Baroness is at one with the Government on that concern. In straitened circumstances, and, given the changes in technology, for the foreseeable future, Channel 4 has to have a different outlet apart from just the television channel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10020386000073"></a>I declare an interest as deputy chairman of Channel 4. During the four years I have been on the board, there has never been any discussion about production being brought in-house. Whether or not the existing terms of trade will be debated and discussed over the coming years is an issue that has all sorts of ramifications. However, none of the discussions of the Channel 4 board have even suggested bringing production in-house. I want to reassure the noble Baroness on that.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10020386000074"></a>I think I am being helpful in raising the broader issue-I was waiting for the Minister to raise this. One of the biggest decisions we made on the Channel 4 board was a decision to take Channel 4's PSB obligations for education online. In hindsight, it was one of the best decisions that we ever made. It was made after a lot of discussion. The truth was that audiences for Channel 4 education were diminishing. Frankly, the young people who the programmes were aimed at were increasingly not around at the time that they were available. It has been an unalloyed success. It is that type of flexibility, and that opportunity, to deliver the best possible programming to audiences when they are there, and in the means that they may have access to, that has made the channel a much more significant player in the education space than was previously the case.</p>

Clause 21 establishes that Channel 4 must participate in distributing films by means of electronic communications networks. Does this mean that it is compulsory for Channel 4 to invest in streaming films over the internet? I can appreciate why it should be allowed to, but is it right that this should be a compulsory requirement?</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10020386000079"></a>As is widely acknowledged, Channel 4, like any other commercially funded broadcaster, has seen its revenues decline in the past year or so, meaning that it has less money to invest in content. Requiring Channel 4 to spend money on films, as set out in the Bill, is adding a further burden on top of the many others this Bill introduces. I am sure the Minister will argue that this clause simply enables Channel 4 to invest in new ways of distribution. If that is the case, it is welcome. However, I am concerned that the language, as drafted, is creating an obligation which might be difficult or impossible for Channel 4 to comply with.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10020386000080"></a>As drafted, Clause 21 appears to require Channel 4 to spend money not only on programmes in which it is already investing, such as Film 4, which does indeed make high-quality British films, but in the broadcasting and distribution of films made by other people. I think that is the UK Film Council's job. Is the duplication necessary? Again, it could add a lot of expense to a depleted budget. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="10020386000081"></a><b><a name="100203-0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="10020386000394"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I hope that I am not suffering under any illusion as regards this being a probing amendment to identify the position relating to C4C and Channel 4. I make the obvious point that C4C can, and already does, provide a wide range of films, on Channel 4 and on its digital channels, in particular on its dedicated film channel, Film 4, and on-demand. I think that noble Lords widely appreciate the value of a great deal of that work. Proposed new subsection 198A(2)(c) does not give C4C any new powers to broadcast or distribute films, but seeks to ensure that it includes in its services films that reflect UK culture. I am sure that I take the whole Committee with me on that objective.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10020386000082"></a>Concerns are sometimes expressed that new-media ventures by the BBC and C4C risk crowding out commercial competition and stifling innovation. I leave the BBC out of the argument for the moment, as I have no wish to prolong this debate or to get hares running. It is important to bear in mind that C4C receives no public funding and competes with other providers on a commercial basis.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10020386000083"></a>With regard to UK films, there is little evidence that leaving provision to the market will ensure that they receive the kind of exposure that we want to see. The C4C brand will help to raise their profile and to build the audience for UK films, which will benefit the wider industry. Again, I hope that all noble Lords share that objective. There have been glories in the British film industry in the past, but we all know the extent to which the industry has been under pressure. Channel 4 has a role to play in building up the audience for UK films. We can all recall one or two of its outstanding successes.</p>

<a name="100203-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10020386000084"></a>We believe that enshrining in statute C4C's commitment to showcasing films that reflect cultural activity in the United Kingdom on various platforms-television as well as online-is very significant. Making it one of C4C's priorities emphasises the contribution that C4C plays in this economically and culturally important sector. The Government believe it is important that C4C's duty should extend to third-party films; that is, films which C4C has not participated in making. This will ensure that C4C showcases the widest range of

I am not seeking applause this evening, merely the recognition from the Opposition that they have probed and that the Government's position is a proper one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10020398000002"></a>Since its early days, Channel 4 has had a strong track record in international content across a range of genres. Some would say this is a defining feature of its output. Notable examples include: "Channel 4 News", which has a higher quotient of international stories than most other news programmes and has a tradition of widening the international news agenda; "Dispatches", Channel 4's current affairs strand which has a good record of consistently covering, and returning to, difficult international stories, especially on Iraq and Afghanistan; and "Unreported World", which covers stories from around the world which do not feature on the usual news/current affairs agenda. Some recent programmes have looked at child widows in Nepal and child rape in Liberia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10020398000003"></a>It is significant that Channel 4 has recognised that non-news and current affairs content is equally important. "True Stories", More4's award-winning documentary strand showcases the best documentaries from around the world, many of which give a real insight into the lives of people in other countries. Recent programmes include: "Afghan Star", an entertaining and insightful film about a "Pop Idol"-style contest in Afghanistan, and "The Glass House", a powerful film about women and girls in Iran who have been the victims of domestic violence or cruelty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10020398000004"></a>Channel 4, to its credit, has a knack of approaching global issues with a popular and innovative touch which enables a range of audiences to connect with stories and people from around the world. This is particularly evident in its drama output. Highlights include "Sex Traffic", a pioneering drama highlighting the issue of trafficking women for prostitution, and "Slumdog Millionaire", the multi Oscar award-winning film from Film4, which documented the lives of children in the slums of Mumbai and was one of the most popular films in British cinemas last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10020398000005"></a>The central importance of international content was recognised by Channel 4 when it launched its <I>Next on 4</I> mission statement which identified four core public purposes: to nurture new talent; to champion alternative voices and perspectives; to challenge people to see the world differently; and to inspire positive change in people's lives. No fewer than three of these purposes have been incorporated into the Digital Economy Bill. However, it is both surprising and disappointing that the original wording of the third purpose,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="10020398000052"></a>"To challenge people to see the world differently",</p>

<p><a name="10020398000048"></a>has not been kept in the Bill. No one has explained satisfactorily why this purpose has been dropped. In comparison, the BBC charter has as one of its six purposes:</p>

<p><a name="10020398000049"></a>Making this ambition explicit in the charter has had a huge impact. It is true that Channel 4's new functions will also include a requirement to contribute towards the fulfilment of the public service objectives, as defined in new Section 264A of the Communications Act 2003, but we must be clear that this refers only to news and current affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10020398000006"></a>This short amendment will preserve the international content in other genres-drama, film, documentary, and specialist factual. While I appreciate that the current Channel 4 regime recognises that international content is a key part of its output, and I am reassured that it has no intention of cutting back on it, I fear that, if a duty towards internationalism is not specifically included in the Bill and enshrined in legislation, a future Channel 4 regime may see this as an area ripe for cuts. So I urge the Government to support this simple amendment and strengthen Channel 4's remit for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10020398000009"></a>I have tabled this probing amendment because of concern on these Benches about the situation that children's television finds itself in. A gap in the market has opened up as a result of ITV withdrawing from this area, which has meant that £30 million a year is no longer being invested in UK-made children's TV. It particularly affects those children in the age group that has left behind the likes of CBeebies, but does not want to watch repeat programmes such as "Come Dine with Me" and "Escape to the Country", which are not part of the 10 to 15 year-old diet. We know them as the "Grange Hill generation".</p>

This group needs to be identified in the Bill, in order that it does not, as now, fall below the radar. I beg to move.</p>

It has been very good news to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that some of the material for children that has gone online has proved a great success. I should like to see more children's programming in general and therefore am concerned that this might be a slight restriction if it is put in the Bill. I hope that I am wrong in my interpretation, but it is something to bear in mind, because the more that Channel 4 can do in this direction, the happier we would all be.</p>

Perhaps it would be helpful to have an explanation-I am sure that there are cogent reasons-why the age range of 10 to 15 has been chosen.</p>

It is a difficulty that the Government also have. We are not against the broad thrust of the amendment. There is clear agreement about the problem that has been identified and which C4C has a duty to address. Pre-school and young children are, as Ofcom's review of public service broadcasting noted, broadly well served. Those of us who are grandparents can testify to that. Grandchildren invite grandparents to watch television with them. The trouble is, in my experience, that once they get beyond the age of 10, they do not want grandparents watching with them, and therefore we know a great deal less about those children's programmes, such as they are, than about CBeebies and others.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10020398000014"></a>Although there is broad agreement about the problem, there are different views about how we solve the issue of definition. Ofcom's review referred to children of primary school age and above, whereas its 2007 research report <I>The Future of Children's Television Programming</I><I></I>looked at nine to 12 year-olds. We are all wrestling with definitions. We know the broad target group that we want to see programmes provided for, but the problem with legislation is that excessive provision could be restrictive. C4C's report <I>Next on 4</I><I>, </I>published in March 2008, proposed a new public service role for the corporation in relation to children's content, targeting 10 to 15 year-olds. The <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper identified as a priority the plurality of public service content for children, especially the over-10s. We are all thinking very much along the same lines in seeking to address the problem. While 10 to 15 is broadly the age range that the Government have in mind, we would not want to be too prescriptive in defining older children. Focusing C4C's remit on 10 to 15 year-olds could limit its flexibility to provide content for children outside this age range or content for more narrowly targeted age groups. Within its duty to provide content for older children, we would also want C4C to refocus its output if developments in the wider provision of content for children were to make this appropriate.</p>

That is the group Channel 4 is being asked to cater for. Obviously, 10 to 15 is a problematic age group. I hope that my two nephews and one godson who are about to be 15 do not read this debate, because they would be extremely upset to be grouped with 10 year-olds.

If this paragraph is removed, Channel 4 will be limited to investing in television programmes, digital television channels and on-demand services. That is to say, internet-based services would not be part of Channel 4's duties, except in so far as to ensure that their content was available online through catch-up services.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10020398000018"></a>The amendment highlights the fact that the clause would require Channel 4 to invest in services provided by the internet where there is a person who exercises editorial control. The most obvious type of internet service where someone exercises editorial control is a newspaper website. Is it the wish or the intention that Channel 4 should invest in these, because that is what this definition would appear to allow for? It is questionable whether some of the projects that Channel 4 currently invests in through its 4iP project are appropriate or relevant for a broadcaster. Recent projects include a Facebook application to show users how their lifestyle will change the way they look over time, and an iPhone application that helps people to exercise more. Both projects could be described as having a public service role, but are they the sort of things that Channel 4 should be investing in? I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on these types of investments and whether he thinks that the current drafting of the Bill allows Channel 4 to go beyond the limits of what most of the public would consider reasonable for a public service broadcaster. I beg to move.</p>

I hope to help the noble Lord, Lord Howard, get his head around the challenges to Channel 4. First, no public funds come into Channel 4; it exists entirely within the commercial marketplace, which presents its own challenges. More important than that is what has happened with the explosion of digital opportunities that the channel is attempting to take advantage of. We are discovering that by putting programming together with the opportunities that that programming allows online we are getting a dramatically increased impact in terms of our public service obligations. That is so particularly in the area of health. The noble Lord mentioned the iPhone application linked to exercise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10020398000020"></a>We are beginning to understand dozens of things about the way in which behaviours can be influenced by a programme. A programme can generate the initial interest but behaviours, ironically, are generated more by the online opportunity that a programme creates. We think we may have a tool which is of enormous public service interest and public service benefit. It is very early days and we are very much in the experimental phase, but I sincerely believe that some of the experimental work being done, by 4iP in particular, may end up being of enormous national importance and of real interest in helping us to navigate through some of the social problems that we, as a nation, are trying to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10020398000022"></a>In the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper, we made it clear that C4C's current public service remit, limited as it is to the Channel 4 television service, is now too television-centric for the role that C4C should play in Britain's digital media. We consider it has a role to play subject to the obligations which it enjoys as regards its television production. The Government believe that C4C has a vital role to play in offering public service competition to the BBC. I want to emphasise that fact, as my noble friend Lord Puttnam re-emphasised that Channel 4 does not receive public money and so it is in a proper position to compete with the BBC, which receives the licence fee.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10020398000023"></a>As the wider content market evolves, with changing technology and audience expectations, C4C needs to exploit new media to maximise its public service contribution. My noble friend Lord Puttnam gave an illustration of that. If C4C does not offer content to viewers in the formats and on the platforms that best suit them, their ability to contribute to the overall public service offering will inevitably diminish and the organisation itself will be increasingly marginalised. C4C has the right to expect the opportunity to participate in the new digital age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10020398000024"></a>It has been suggested that encouraging C4C to engage in new media operations will inhibit the development of commercial alternatives. Surely, those are displaced. First, C4C will be in the marketplace like the other competitors and will have to compete on an equal footing with them, with the fully commercial alternatives. Secondly, as my noble friend Lord Puttnam

So we have a model of participation in the market which is fair and square.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10020398000025"></a>The amendment would not prevent C4C providing online or other new media content under its existing powers. However, it would affect C4C's new media activities by exempting it from the public service focus provided by the clause as drafted. That would diminish the public value of C4C's new media initiatives. I am quite sure that the public would regard it as such. I hope the noble Lord will appreciate that no advantages are being given to C4C. It does not receive public funds; it is in the marketplace like others; but it would be governed by its remit. That ought to commend it to all parts of the House and I hope it commends it to the noble Lord, Lord Howard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10020398000029"></a>So Ofcom, Parliament and the Government already have considerable regulatory oversight of Channel 4. Why are the Government proposing to introduce the bureaucratic and unwieldy mechanism set out in Clause 22 rather than just incorporating any new requirements into the existing scrutiny system? Section 266 of the Communications Act 2003 is redundant. It requires every licensed public service broadcaster to produce statements of programme policy which take a great deal of time to prepare and therefore cost each channel a great many man hours. These reports, I respectfully suggest, have a limited readership: those who produce the statements, a couple of officials in Ofcom, members of the relevant committees, and I struggle to think of anyone else. The reports contain information that is duplicated in each channel's annual report and they add precisely nothing to the viewing public's experience of each channel. They are a very good example of regulation for regulation's sake. I beg to move.</p>

In the debates leading to the Communications Act 2003, in which I took part, your Lordships were at pains to create a mechanism that provided the public with the opportunity of seeing what their television channels intended to do over the coming year to fulfil their public service remits and how they performed against what they had said they would do in the previous year.</p>

The statements include information on how channels are providing public service content in non-linear ways, most obviously through their websites and on-demand services; how they are promoting media literacy; how they are engaging with public input and feedback. These policy statements are evolving as the communications landscape changes. I do not believe they are redundant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10020398000032"></a>We need to be clear that we are not expecting legions of highly paid executives to pore over output figures for days on end to produce reports. In fact, a check on these last statements suggests that most are well under 10,000 words long. The 2003 Act did not demand rigid calculations, it looked for self-assessment-a reflective look back on how the channel had delivered on core purposes. The statements should, at their best, speak in a way from the heart of the channel about its aspirations for serving the public-its consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10020398000033"></a>We cannot afford to forget, just because times are tight, that we hand a huge privilege to our licensed public service channels. The marketplace for the commercial public service broadcasters is undeniably a challenging one, but the economic context does not devalue the privilege of being a licensed broadcaster on a channel received by the vast majority of the population. With that privilege comes responsibilities, not just to your Lordships or to another place, but to the public as a whole. The simple measurement tool of how the channels are measuring up against those responsibilities is, in my view, not too much to ask.</p>

Channel 4 has been given new, welcome duties under this Bill, and we feel therefore that there has to be accountability. We of course agree with that.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10020398000036"></a>I have of course to defend Clause 22, which the noble Lord is suggesting should be withdrawn from the Bill, because it introduces an accountability and enforcement framework to ensure the fulfilment of the C4C duties introduced by Clause 21. These are based on the existing accountability and enforcement arrangements for the licensed public service channels under the Communications Act 2003. This is a very important clause as far as the Government are concerned.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10020398000037"></a>Amendment 233 would have repealed Section 266 of the Communications Act. Section 266 establishes a framework of annual statements of programme policy for the licensed public service broadcasters. Ofcom has powers of direction to enforce the public service remits and powers to sanction licensees for any breaches of any licence condition. However, the statements of programme policy reinforce the public service broadcasting system by focusing licensees' attention on an overall strategy for delivering their public service remits, rather than concentrating narrowly on the quantitative targets attached to their licences. If the repeal of the statement of programme policy provisions were considered necessary, it would be preferable to do so by secondary legislation. Clause 37 of this Bill amends the Communications Act 2003 so as to permit such a provision to be reversed, also by order. I hope therefore that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, will see that we have made provision for that eventuality, if in due course that is the wisest position to adopt.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10020398000038"></a>Amendment 232C would introduce a new clause requiring C4C to report on its media content duties in its own annual report and accounts. One of the intentions of the amendment appears to be to exclude Ofcom from this exercise. Although C4C needs to provide the first line of accountability, Ofcom certainly has an important role to play, offering both guidance and oversight. That position has obtained for a number of years.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10020398000039"></a>Clause 22 therefore creates a requirement for C4C to prepare and publish annual accounts of media content policy, setting out how it proposes to discharge  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_244"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its new duties over the coming year and reviewing its previous year's performance. It also creates corresponding duties and powers for Ofcom, which ought to be an additional reassurance.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10020398000040"></a>Concerns have been expressed about the creation of additional regulatory burdens, but Ofcom has indicated that the new arrangements will have minimal start-up and ongoing resource implications. C4C likewise has indicated that the new arrangements will not have material cost implications for it, so we can discount that element.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10020398000041"></a>The Government also believe that it would be unduly restrictive to require C4C reports on the fulfilment of its new content duties to be produced to the same timetable as the annual reports. No such requirement applies to statements of programme policy in relation to the Channel 4 service. I hope noble Lords will see that Amendment 232C is not necessary.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10020398000042"></a>The proposed new Section 198B of the Communications Act 2003, as I have indicated, requires C4C to prepare and publish annual statements of media content policy. Like the statements of programme policy under Section 266, the aim is to focus C4C's attention on an overall strategy for fulfilling its duty. The requirement to publish the statement, which will include reviews of the channel's performance against its previous statement, will help to ensure accountability and transparency. I am sure noble Lords opposite will respond positively to this.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10020398000043"></a>New Section 198C will require Ofcom to review and report on C4C's discharge of its duties under Section 198A. These reviews are to coincide with the reviews that Clause 3 of the Bill introduces, under proposed new Section 264A of the Communications Act 2003, on the fulfilment of the public service objectives by other media services.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10020398000044"></a>New Section 198D creates a power of direction for Ofcom if it considers that C4C has failed to perform one or more of its duties under Section 198A or to prepare and publish a statement of media content policy.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10020398000045"></a>In some cases, increasing the obligations on the licensed Channel 4 service, may be an effective remedy for a failure by C4C to fulfil its functions under Section 198A. Clause 22(2) therefore introduces a proposed new Section 271A of the Communications Act 2003. This provides that if C4C fails to comply with a direction relating to a failure to perform one or more of its duties under Section 198A, and Ofcom is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate, it can vary the Channel 4 licence by making or adding such conditions as it considers appropriate to remedy C4C's failure. Ofcom will have the power to vary the licence again if it concludes that any of the new conditions are no longer necessary.</p>

<a name="100203-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10020398000046"></a>That is the significance of Clause 22, and is why we regard it as absolutely essential that it should remain in the Bill. I emphasise that these issues have been carefully thought through by the Government, as there are advantages in having a position where both C4C and Ofcom have regard in their reports to the obligation of C4C. I hope that noble Lords will therefore consider

I respectfully contend that the information which the right reverend Prelate seeks is already adequately provided. I am afraid that the response of the Minister was what we have come to expect from a Government who have passed two Acts allowing for deregulation, but have hardly used them at all. Just as excessive red tape is strangling our private sector it is also, in our view, placing unnecessary burdens on the public sector. It does not sound as though I am going to get a great deal of support around the Committee, but I strongly want to lodge an objection to what we regard as excessive bureaucracy, so I beg leave to seek the opinion of the Committee.</p>

It is a probing amendment to seek assurances on the issue.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="100203101000002"></a>The Royal National Institute for Deaf People told us that around 1 million people use subtitles frequently and 5 million people use them whenever possible. Subtitles are therefore a key tool to help to ensure that millions of people who would not otherwise be able to do so are able to enjoy television programmes. Before digital television arrived, access to subtitles was through teletext page 888. I appreciate that when the digital switchover is completed in 2012, users will be able to access subtitles through their digital services. However, until that process has happened, it would be very reassuring if the Minister could tell the Committee that any move to stop the teletext service will not mean the absence of subtitles.

The code requires commercial public service broadcasters to provide and promote relevant access services for the understanding and enjoyment of persons of sensory impairment. The provision of subtitling is therefore a matter separate from the provision of the public teletext service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="100203101000004"></a>I accept that, because subtitles are provided on the same platform as teletext on analogue, the public may assume that the existence of analogue subtitles relies on the continuing provision of teletext.

This will ensure that public service broadcasters continue to fulfil their regulatory obligations. I trust that with that assurance the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This amendment goes to the heart of the opposition from these Benches to this clause. We do not believe that public subsidy should be used to prop up the current system of regional news. It grew up in the analogue age of broadcasting, and it seems to us on these Benches that when going into the digital age, it is a mistake to seek to maintain what is there, simply because it is there. There may be better, and possibly more radical, solutions. We should be looking at regulatory changes to enable improved models of regional and local news to grow up. In the internet era, people get their news from a wide variety of sources, so it seems strange to make the public pay to keep a half-hour slot on one particular channel.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="100203101000007"></a>There are a number of questions about this particular section of Clause 28, which allows the Government to pay independently financed news consortia, the so-called IFNCs. Is it still the Government's intention to use licence fee money to pay these consortia? I appreciate that the Bill makes no mention of the licence fee, but in the <I>Digital Britain</I> report, and in subsequent statements from Ministers, it seems to be the case that it will be the source of funding. If this is so, can the Minister confirm whether this clause allows the Government to top-slice the licence fee at some point in the future without any further parliamentary scrutiny? Alternatively, if there is some other source of funding in mind, it would be helpful if the Minister could highlight where the funding will come from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="100203101000008"></a>One further aspect relating to the funding of these consortia makes little sense. If they are to be funded by the licence fee or from general taxation, then surely they are not "independently financed" but completely dependent on the Government. We do not believe that using public subsidy in this way will create a long-term, financially sustainable model. I beg to move.</p>

Impartiality and independence are crucial for the news, so surely it is appropriate that this is procured and paid for via an independent body that appoints these providers. That is the Government's intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="100203101000011"></a>The noble Lord pressed me, as I might well have anticipated that he would, on how we intend to pay for these consortia. He is all too well aware that the Government indicated some time ago that we thought that there might be an option for various sources, but we have taken no decision on this and have indicated that we have not. We are aware that some public funding will be needed, and perhaps part of the licence fee could fulfil this role, but we know that there are objections on many sides. There are those who want no support at all for local and regional news but who somehow think that the market will provide it, against all the evidence, and there are those who are anxious that this might be an onslaught on the BBC and its licence fee. The Government have not reached a definitive position on where the money is to come from at this stage, but we are prepared to canvass options. We are, however, certain of the principle, which is where we disagree with the noble Lord and why I hope he will recognise that the Government cannot accept this amendment.</p>

That looks to be a distinctly possible and appropriate resource that has no implications of top-slicing the BBC. After all, the whole concept of the switchover funds is additional to and separate from the licence fee. I know that they are part of the settlement for the BBC, but the BBC has a specific purpose that it will fulfil at a predictable cost, and we are gratified that it looks as though the resources that we had in mind for that may not be used entirely for the digital switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="100203101000014"></a>As I said, we have not reached a conclusion on long-term funding. We carried out a consultation on the matter, and it was fairly clear that regional and local news services were considered to be necessary. The noble Lord mentioned his radical proposals. If the major drive behind the Opposition's amendment is the belief in a commercial market for local and regional news, to say nothing of national news eventually, and a belief in the commercial strategies that are pursued in the United States, all I can say is that the Government-and, we believe, the British public-are very concerned that the independence of news broadcasters should be maintained, and public resources have a role to play in that.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="100203101000017"></a>Amendments 233ZE and 233ZF, which are in the name of my noble friend Lord Lucas, seek to provide that Ofcom prevents a person who is disqualified under the stated paragraph in the 1990 Act from being appointed under Clause 28. That is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="100203101000018"></a>Our Amendment 233B raises an important point about the impact that public subsidy could have on the quality and independence of our regional and local journalism. If these consortia are dependent on public subsidy, is it too sceptical to suggest that the most important people for them to please will be in the organisation that provides them with their subsidy? There is surely a real concern that there is a risk-whether it is perceived or real is, to some extent, immaterial-that their focus will be diluted from unbiased journalism into pursuing subsidy. Instead of concentrating on providing impartial news, there is at least a danger that the consortia will become too focused on doing what the provider of their livelihood wants or what the consortia think the provider wants. Nothing needs to be said, but there is always pressure not to bite the hand that feeds you. Surely it is vital that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the best traditions of our press-namely, its freedom to report entirely independently on public figures and public bodies-will be preserved, before any public subsidy is given.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="100203101000019"></a>Amendment 233C is a probing amendment to ask the Minister whether the Government have taken advice on whether there are any state aid issues with the provision of public funds to regional news organisations. I remind your Lordships that the Government ran into problems when they tried to pay Channel 4's digital switchover infrastructure costs using the licence fee. If the EU managed to prevent this £14 million transfer of funding, surely it would show a similar interest in any spending of state money, which could total around £130 million a year, on regional news. Have the Government resolved such problems with the EU? I beg to move.</p>

Allowing local authorities, therefore, to join IFNCs would automatically defeat this objective. It is against that background that I am entirely happy to agree with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and accept that the disqualifications that he suggests are appropriate. I will therefore be accepting Amendment 233ZF, which the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, spoke to on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

As for Amendment 233B, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, I hope that as we have got the improvement and clarity provided by the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, which I am accepting, it will reassure him that IFNCs will not adversely impact on the independence of journalism, and therefore that the amendment is no longer necessary.</p>

That has been the way in which the policy has been developed so far, and the way in which the arrangements for the independently-financed news consortia pilots, due to start in April, are proceeding. The programmes that emerge from these independent news consortia will be shown on the Channel 3 network. Should funding become available to support their full rollout across England, Scotland and Wales, we would hope that the process for establishing these services continues to involve the agreement and support of the relevant ITV Channel 3 licensees.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="100203106000002"></a>I have always understood that that was the purpose, and intent, of the Government's policy-not to force IFNCs on ITV and STV, but to make them available on the basis that there was no longer sufficient value in the Channel 3 licensees to support the existing nations and regions news services. As currently drafted, however, Clause 28 does not fully capture that intent. It would instead entitle Ofcom to select an appointed independent news provider and to impose that provider on an existing Channel 3 licensee. This is despite the fact that the licensed broadcaster would continue to carry all the statutory obligations and the necessary compliance risk for the continuing provision of the service, including legal and technical risks.</p>

<a name="100203-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="100203106000003"></a>There is also the matter of editorial control. Channel 3 has to protect its brand and to keep its audience. When ITV commissions a programme from an independent production company, it is an ITV executive who has the final say in what is broadcast. This must be so with the news programmes that it carries as well. It is therefore only right that decisions on the approach and implementation of the IFNC schemes should continue to involve broadcasters and proceed only on an agreed basis. My amendment is designed to encourage the continuation of such a collaborative approach. I hope that, in responding to what I have said, the Government will undertake to give further consideration to the current drafting of Clause 28, and look to revise it to take account of the points that I have raised. I beg to move.</p>

The respective Channel 3 licence holders having their say before an IFNC is appointed is an important issue. My noble friend Lord Gordon emphasised that point.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="100203106000006"></a>It would be unreasonable for Ofcom to require a replacement news provider to deliver the regional news on Channel 3 without first consulting the relevant licence holder and receiving representations from that license holder beforehand. We confidently expect that to be done against the obvious expectations of Ofcom and what the clause says. The Government recognise this. We have already provided for such a duty requiring Ofcom to consult Channel 3 licence holders, as set out in new Section 287A(8). The new subsection properly connects the public service licensing regime, under Section 287 of the Communications Act 2003, where Ofcom must consult license holders and receive representations before making any changes, with the powers set out in this new clause. We are linked, therefore, to that Communications Act obligation. This represents a consistent and robust approach to Ofcom consulting each Channel 3 service on the imposition of the new conditions. I am entirely accepting of the thrust of the noble Baroness's amendment, but saying that in fact we have not really accepted that argument. We have addressed our minds to that argument and that is what is reflected in the clause. I hope therefore that the noble Baroness can confidently withdraw that amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="100203106000007"></a>Amendment 233CB also raises an important issue-the impact on plurality and the choice of news provision in the appointed areas. What the amendment would do, however, is to require Ofcom to make an assessment or an evaluation of an appointment in advance of that appointment actually being made. As the Committee will readily appreciate, Ofcom effectively assesses the UK news and media marketplace, and we do not expect that obligation to change in any way. We would expect a determination of impact to follow the selection process.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="100203106000008"></a>I do not think that the amendment is necessary. Ofcom cannot carry out those duties without evaluating the result of the selection process.

It is understandable that they want to ensure that the content made by the appointed person is of a certain quality. However, it is worrying that they would like to shape the character and form of the content. Subsection (2) of new Section 287A to be inserted in the Communications Act 2003 under Clause 28 states that anyone who is "appointed under this section" takes on the regulatory regime of the Channel 3 service. I assume that this means that it would have to produce impartial news content. If so, that is to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="100203106000012"></a>However, if there is any ambiguity around this, allowing the regulator to set the character and form of any news that the appointed person produces sounds rather Orwellian. Are we to be treated to Ofcom's version of events? Will the character of such news be slanted to look favourably on regulators, governments or anything else that the appointed person cares to think about? It is worrying that these news consortia may not in practice be independent and that the power Ofcom has to control the character of their output could result in slanting or distorting news. I am sure, as is the position today, that Ofcom would not abuse its position, but it would be quite wrong to leave open the possibility for the future.</p>

Subsection (5)(c) of new Section 287A to be inserted in the Communications Act 2003 under Clause 28 states that Ofcom may lay down conditions requiring IFNCs to make their news content available to "any other person". Subsection (6)(c) allows Ofcom to ensure that IFNCs help to promote other people's content. At first sight, these subsections would appear to allow Ofcom an extraordinary level of regulatory control over the running of these organisations. Ofcom is able to tell the IFNCs who to give their content to and tell them what media or other content they must promote. These organisations will not exactly be independent if they have their activities regulated to such an extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="100203106000017"></a>Finally, if the IFNCs are required to give their content away, how will they become commercially viable? Their only asset is the content that they make. If they cannot sell it, they will be for ever dependent on public subsidy, or is that the intention? These two subsections appear to confirm that the Government want to see these news consortia run from the centre with no way of weaning themselves away from taxpayers' support. Perhaps the Minister can reassure the Committee that that is not the case. I beg to move.</p>

To that extent, it might not be inappropriate for the IFNC to offer its news service, or its audio version, to local radio stations.</p>

I found an element of contradiction in the contribution put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Howard. He suggested that the news consortia should have freedom for access to other resources. No one is saying anything about that. We are merely indicating that where we are able to identify that local and regional news could not be obtained through the marketplace, here is a structure to enable that to occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="100203112000002"></a>I do not understand how, therefore, he can suggest that Amendment 233E should be commended to the Committee. It would prevent innovation. It is not good for news providers or audiences if there is no scope for development. We are merely recognising the importance of news provision online and the possible

The noble Lord seems to indicate that that should be inhibited, yet he is concerned about public money and support. We believe that the need to find models that continue to reach audiences and more opportunities to provide content relevant to local people, including user-generated content and hyper-local use, has substantial possibilities. However, there has to be a structure that makes it possible. If we accepted Amendment 233E, there would be a great inhibition on that.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="100203112000003"></a>On Amendment 233H, the funding used to sustain plurality in local and regional news should also have the wider benefit of helping high-quality independent journalism to thrive and keep citizens informed. That is why the subsection talks about supporting and promoting the provision of news. Let us make no bones about it: this is also about training and the development of skills. When local and regional news sources flourished rather more than they do now and were not under quite the threat and limitations of the present time, our most talented reporters, investigators and presenters cut their teeth on them. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Howard, will know only too well from his own perspective that a large number of the Lobby correspondents at the other end-we all have reservations about Lobby correspondents on occasion and I cannot pretend that I agree with every one of their contributions and interpretations-came up through local and regional newspapers and news provisions to reach the dizzy heights of being a Lobby correspondent here. All news is demanding in terms of accuracy and objectivity, but by definition political news and commenting on political events make demands all of their own when it comes to objectivity and standards.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="100203112000004"></a>We have no doubt that there will be a need to nurture journalistic activity and to develop multimedia skills in circumstances where the market is not going to sustain the level of training and development that has obtained in the past. We also know the reasons and the enormous problems in that regard. So while I hear what the noble Lord says about his anxieties, I always share in his optimism about what can be achieved if there is a will and a structure that engages enterprise, skill and talent. That is what we are trying to do here and I am afraid that his amendment would limit it. I hope that he will consider withdrawing it.</p>

The breeze I refer to is the lazy belief that increased plurality in the provision of news and current affairs allows us the luxury of reducing our unconditional commitment to impartiality.

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="100203112000009"></a>Martin Kettle, writing in the <I>Guardian</I> on 18 December, finished his article by saying:</p>

<p><a name="100203112000046"></a>James Murdoch, whom I have a great deal of respect for, particularly on his environmental views, had this to say in the MacTaggart lecture delivered on 28 August 2009. Mr Murdoch is a very influential and powerful man, so I shall quote him at some length because I want to do him justice:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="100203112000052"></a>"We must have a plurality of voices and they must be independent. Yet we have a system in which state-sponsored media-the BBC in particular grow ever more dominant ... Above all, we must have genuine independence in news media. Genuine independence is a rare thing. No amount of governance in the form of committees, regulators, trusts or advisory bodies is truly sufficient as a guarantor of independence. In fact, they curb speech.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="100203112000053"></a>On the contrary, independence is characterised by the absence of the apparatus of supervision and dependency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="100203112000010"></a>It would be impossible to sit on these Benches and agree with Mr Murdoch.

I have not spoken in this debate so far for several reasons, so I hope I will be excused if I speak for slightly longer than my noble friend. We are in a dangerous spot. One man's impartiality is another man's oppression. One woman's notion of plurality is another woman's idea of unlicensed, unpalatable excess. It is not easy, but we have to face up to it.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100203112000012"></a>A sense of impartiality, and one clearly recognised to be such, in major news bulletins is essential for the functioning of a democracy. A democracy is difficult enough in a number of ways, these days, as people's demands increase in number and volume; as the state increases its reach and responsibility and as private companies understandably drive harder for profit and control and markets in the new precarious multi-choice media world. We have to address it and we have to get it right. Especially here, in your Lordships' House which, over recent years, has increasingly been called on to defend the basic rights of men and women in this country.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="100203112000013"></a>On the one hand we have an asserted fear that the size and historical clout of the BBC tends to make it an overdominant statist voice, threatening a monopoly for its viewpoint. I do not see or hear that on the BBC news bulletins. Its independence is often tested but it still remains intact. It seems to me largely still to strive towards an admirable impartiality and, on a British empirical common-sense reckoning, it still provides a fine example, well followed by other news bulletins in this country-those on Channel 4, ITV and Sky-although, as my noble friend Lord Puttnam pointed out, there have been siren voices.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100203112000014"></a>This can be seen more starkly across the Atlantic. The United States is worth looking at briefly because of the history of American influence on our media culture. I refer to the discussion now under way in the States on Fox News, which your Lordships will know about. A recent opinion poll suggested that it was the most trusted news operation in the country. After that poll, Mike Hoyt, editor of the <I>Col</I><I>u</I><I>mbia Journalism Review</I>, explored the issue. He said that "fair and balanced" may be the network's motto, but in many respects it is anything but. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="100203112000059"></a>"Fox News is not really a news network it's a commentary network. Its news output is a small island in a vast sea of very conservative commentary".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="100203112000015"></a>Dean Denham, president of Public Policy Policing, the North Carolina-based survey firm that carried out the poll, said the Fox strategy had been brilliant commercially, but its implications were troubling. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="100203112000060"></a>"That people see the network as trustworthy is worrying in terms of the future of reasoned debate in America. A lie screamed loudly will trump a truth spoken quietly".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="100203112000016"></a>Nearer home, qualms about the biased approach of the network have reached the Murdoch family. Earlier this year the PR executive Matthew Freud, who is married to Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, told the <I>New York Times</I><I></I>that he was,</p>
<ul><a name="100203112000063"></a>"ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes's horrendous and sustained disregard of journalistic standards".</ul>
<a name="100203-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="100203112000017"></a>I think those voices are worth listening to. At a time of potential world dislocation and even world destruction on an unprecedented scale an impartial agenda is surely crucial.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="100203112000018"></a>Plurality can produce much-needed variety, but also through ferocious competition it can breed beasts as big as any that the state can produce. The only way is to look at the question constantly and carefully, to question impartiality on these news bulletins and see that it is observed. John Milton was right. He was right in the 17th century and he is right today. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Liberty, which relies on unpolluted information, is the underpinning of democracy. Democracy, as your Lordships know very well, is rather rare and it is a fragile state. It depends on and allows for clashing views. It encourages dissent. It glories in opposition, which perpetually slows it down, but always in the end holds it up. At the centre of democracy is a well-informed electorate. At the core of that is the idea of impartiality. We know what that is, especially when it is not there.</p>

<a name="100203-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="100203112000019"></a>This may need regulation-a word more often held in contempt nowadays. However, regulation has brought this country some of the finest radio and television we have, which holds its own with that in any other country in the world. I urge all sides of the Committee, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Puttnam and myself, to endorse the broad thrust of these amendments and ensure that the notion of impartiality is embedded in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="100203112000022"></a>The Government regard the rules on due impartiality and accuracy applying to TV and radio services as very important.

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="100203112000023"></a>It is interesting how we all spend a great deal of time berating the weaknesses that are identified from time to time in our democratic practices. Reform is ever in the air and I would be the last to want to countenance against that. From time to time it is necessary to step back and recognise those things that we do well that are important in sustaining our democratic traditions. I do not have the slightest doubt that the rules with regard to broadcasting that derive from the origins of the BBC, but now obtain across the field of broadcasting and the media landscape, are of the greatest significance to the society in which we live.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="100203112000024"></a>It is clear that the media landscape is changing significantly and audiences now get their news from a much wider mix of sources, including digital television. Some have argued that because of this multiplicity the due impartiality rule is not needed. We do not agree. The rule of due impartiality for TV and radio services is still critically important. There is space for opinionated news. I listened carefully to what my noble friend Lord Bragg said about the nature of Fox News-a little bit of news among a great deal of opinionated commentary.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="100203112000025"></a>We all recognise that newspapers spend an awful lot of their time on comment. Because, by definition, newspapers are slower to enter the public's consciousness than other forms of projection of the news, they increasingly spend rather more of their time on comment than news. There have always been newspapers which have been pretty opinionated in their stance on matters. The due impartiality rule on TV and radio must continue. It must continue to guarantee that viewers enjoy unbiased, informative news.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="100203112000026"></a>All our surveys and Ofcom's surveys with regard to broadcasting indicate how strongly the British public support the concept of unbiased, informative but impartial news. That concept of impartiality, which both my noble friends have emphasised in their contributions, is of the greatest significance. If television news is considered to be the most trusted of news sources by audiences, there is little doubt that it is thanks to the impartiality rule, which is why the Government are eager that that should continue. Weakening the rule would affect the level of trust that people have in news and would ultimately affect people's engagement and interest in this news. That is clearly not good for audiences or broadcasters and, most of all, it is not good for our democracy. Therefore, it is not in the public interest of a democratic nation. If we look to sustain the due impartiality requirements for news supported by public funds, I hope that that will not only indicate how much I agree with my noble friends but reassure those on Benches opposite about the due

The Government should have a view on what direction of travel they want to be seen to be travelling in. In effect, the maximum fine is less today than it was at the time of the original Bill. However, I am certainly happy not to press that amendment. In withdrawing Amendment 234, I make one point. I am the son of a journalist and was brought up in an environment in which all newspapers clearly differentiated between opinion and news. The <I>Daily Telegraph</I> in particular used to have it on the masthead. That has become a great rarity today. Most front pages of most newspapers contain opinion, not news; you have to seek the news, having got past the headlines which are essentially opinion. That is the status quo-we are not going to change that. But to allow our broadcast news to slip into that type of norm and for that to become a condition into which broadcast news is allowed to drift would be catastrophic for us as a democracy. Again, we will return to that on Report, and I hope that the whole House will be prepared to endorse the broad thrust of where we are trying to go. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In simple terms, I can understand, even if I do not agree with, the argument that this money will be used to provide a regional news broadcast on ITV. Where I am uncertain is how the Government believe that this will help the regional newspaper sector, as has been suggested. If the money is to be used to produce a half-hour bulletin of regional news, how does that help the printed media? They do not currently make such broadcasts, so the money will not go to cover their existing costs. If there is some possibility that newspapers involved in these IFNCs might be allowed to use the money to cross-subsidise their current operations and output, the Government need

There will be some very difficult competition issues to get around if one newspaper in an area uses public subsidy to compete with a local rival. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain what exactly the Government want to see the money used for. I beg to move.</p>

A cardinal point behind the Government's proposals on the IFNCs and funding is to ensure that gaps that appear and cause distress because of the disappearance of local news are filled. In some cases, as the noble Lord will be all too well aware, the issue is not the plurality of newspapers but whether there is one there at all. If there is one, it tends to be the only outlet. We are concerned to see newspapers supported to a degree, when it can be guaranteed that news provision meets the standards that we expect with regard to broadcasting provision.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="100203112000032"></a>Restricting the funding as the noble Lord suggests would be to restrict it to television news only. Of course, it is widely recognised-and this is why the Bill is called the Digital Economy Bill-that the future of digital Britain is very much online. The purpose of the clause is to provide for a convergence of news provision across as many platforms as necessary, and not just television. Restricting funding to Channel 3 News is at odds with the principle behind this clause and confines the news to the old analogue world, when the whole concept behind the Bill is to make provision for the world that is rapidly developing before us. If we limited IFNC funding or provision to broadcast television, we would be propping up an old model and not recognising the change towards a digital future and a digital economy. That is the main thrust behind the Bill and why the Bill rejoices in its title. We are concerned to ensure that we take account of the increased use which undoubtedly our fellow citizens will make of the new technology, in addition to analogue television, and provide the standards of news coverage which obtained for eight decades or so under old television presentation. The BBC was the sole provider for five or six decades, with independent television playing its part subsequently. We are now moving into a digital Britain, and we have to provide for that.</p>

I believe that it has been suggested that this will be of assistance to local newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="100203112000034"></a>My second point is that if there was some subsidy for newspapers, how would one choose which to give it to if more than one newspaper was involved in the same area?

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="100203112000036"></a>As far as newspapers are concerned, the funding would be provided to consortia for local and regional news, which might well include regional newspapers. The consortia would replace existing TV and online news. However, this is not about subsidising newspapers. It is about securing plurality of news syndication so that the values and principles obtaining to television broadcast news are sustained in local and regional news. Against the present background, we see their outlets, support and finances greatly reduced, if not almost collapsed, and it is quite clear that some support is necessary.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="100203112000037"></a>I am not going to get into a debate about whether one newspaper is going to be subsidised against another-that would be an absurd proposition to put forward in terms of how these resources are distributed. There would be significant consortia undertaking to provide news services of a regional and local category, and they would have to meet the criteria which underpin the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="100203112000049"></a>Does this therefore mean that a newspaper which is appointed under this section will be able to spend money on its own website? If this is the case, surely its rivals will have a pretty good argument that they are being driven out of business by a subsidised competitor; indeed, as I commented when speaking to the last amendment, it is a question of who gets the subsidy.

I am indicating that in a greatly changed media environment, and one which is going to change with great rapidity in the foreseeable future, we have to move beyond the analogue world. We have to ensure that where services are needed-we are talking, remember, about news services-they are delivered according to standards which underpin the Bill and the provision of television news, in terms of impartiality.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="100203112000043"></a>I say to the noble Lord that these services are of course likely to be concentrated in areas where they deliver public value-and therefore are wanted-or where there is market failure. I know the noble Lord treats this with equanimity, but the Government do not. In his perspective on this Bill, the noble Lord seems to be oblivious to the fact that the market is not a guarantor of local and regional news provision. This provision, as we are watching, is in steady decline; we know the reasons for this. My noble friends Lord Puttnam and Lord Bragg, who have now departed the Chamber, spoke on news issues regarding earlier amendments. They eloquently articulated the fact that the values regarding news provision ought to be universally obtained; both expressed the extent to which we have a collapse of the market in crucial areas of this news provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="100203112000044"></a>As a sufficient analyst of the contemporary scene, the noble Lord will know very well that there are market failures. If he says he can treat them with equanimity, I say the Government do not think we should. The public expectation of local and regional news of a high standard is legitimate. There is market failure in these provisions: that is why we have this concept of independent news consortia in the Bill, predicated on the assumption that they are there because we have identified a need. I defy the noble Lord to indicate from the Dispatch Box that he cannot see any weakness in the market.</p>

I feel almost guilty in raising such a mundane matter after the high-flown principles we have had so far. I also wish to make it clear that, given the specific nature of this amendment in relation to satellite navigation systems, I have no financial interest to declare. The matter was raised with me in the Tea Room at the other end of the Corridor. I thought that it was of interest and tabled an amendment accordingly. It is a probing amendment designed to ask the Government to look at an area of radio broadcasting that appears to have been completely omitted from the Bill.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="100203113000002"></a>ITIS, the major company in this area, has two concerns. It provides local and national traffic reports to a variety of outlets including satellite navigation systems. Traffic reports to satellite navigation devices go through the same FM bandwidth used by Classic FM at present via an arrangement with Global Radio, the owner of Classic FM. ITIS is obviously concerned that any changes in the switchover of radio from FM to digital-this part of the Bill is called "Digital switchover"-would make its services inoperable.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="100203113000003"></a>Digital technology for satellite devices is being developed, but many existing cars and cars for the immediate future-particularly those in the upper price ranges such as BMWs, Jaguars and Rolls-Royces, which have a longer lifespan than others-have satellite navigation devices built-in to the car. I just use a plug-in whenever I need it, and obviously I could buy a new one, but if you buy a car with a satellite navigation system built in, you cannot do that.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="100203113000004"></a>Each of these devices has its own radio transmitter which transmits on an FM bandwidth voice traffic reports to the driver as he is driving. It will say, "There is a major traffic jam ahead. If you turn left, left, left and right you will avoid it and that will be to your benefit". Obviously, that will cease to work if the FM signal is switched off in the future. The company is therefore concerned that the Government should give some assurance that they have at least looked at the matter and considered whether these services can be continued.</p>

<a name="100203-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="100203113000005"></a>The company is also concerned-although this is a matter for Ofcom rather than the Government-that its AS1 licence has to be retendered for next year. There is only one licence of this nature at present. The doubt about its continuation is causing concern not only with the company but with car manufacturers and satellite navigation companies. It is essentially a matter for Ofcom, but there is a concern that there is no provision in the Bill to give a power to Ofcom to renew the licence without retendering. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment refers to the impact that the digital radio switchover may have on satellite navigation systems that receive traffic information, such as early warnings of accidents or details of congestion, via the analogue radio networks. As the digital radio switchover proposes to move all national radio stations to digital-only, the future of the infrastructure, which these traffic services rely on for carriage, is uncertain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="100203113000007"></a>That does not necessarily mean that these services cannot continue on FM. The Government accept that there is a case for allowing the additional service licences, under which these traffic services are licensed, to continue on analogue after the switchover; not least because it would provide continuity of service for motorists. In fact, Clause 30 already provides for consultation with bodies such as satellite navigation providers. Clause 30 requires the Secretary of State to take account of any report submitted by Ofcom and the BBC under Section 67 of the Broadcasting Act 1996. In addition, on requiring such a report, the Secretary of State is obliged to consult any other persons as he thinks fit. That could include providers of traffic and travel information, the motor industry and, with that, providers of satellite navigation services. For those reasons, we do not believe that the amendment is necessary and hope that, in the light of those assurances, my noble friend will feel capable of withdrawing it.</p>

The amendments are designed to ensure that attention is paid to the local and community radio sectors and the many millions of analogue radio listeners-to which I should add the providers of satellite systems about which the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, spoke. They should all be listened to before any decision is taken about switchover. We on these Benches have not hidden the fact that we remain unconvinced that the Government's plans to switchover in 2015 are realistic. We do not believe that audiences will be ready by then.

I do so because the Bill as it stands provides very little safeguard for those who are living in remote areas, some of them perhaps still relying on long wave, let alone FM, for their radio reception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="100203113000015"></a>I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, made about the <I>Digital Britain</I> report. If I recall correctly the point was made at Second Reading that, when 90 per cent has been reached, there will still be one in 10 people-some of whom would presumably lose access via their radio to all the national, BBC and commercial radio stations-for whom we really ought to have the greatest concern. Short of listening via the internet-which I know the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, though no longer in his place, would be urging us to do-or Freeview, there is nothing that the 10 per cent would be able to do until the DAB signal catches up with the FM one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="100203113000016"></a>Through this and other similar amendments, I hope the Government will come to recognise that there are some very serious reservations about giving the Secretary of State the power to set the switchover date without proper statutory consideration of the wider impact of that decision on those communities who are often disconnected from British society physically, and those small stations that serve them. I am much in sympathy with the amendment.</p>

The more one looks at this whole area, it is quite clear that there is a big problem about when this is going to happen, stretching into the future, causing a considerable number of problems.

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="100203113000020"></a>In addition-here I address the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester-the Secretary of State must, on requiring these reports, consult such persons representing listeners and such other persons as he thinks fit, as provided in Section 67(4).</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="100203113000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard, talked about plans to switchover in 2015. That is a target that we have set, not a precise date, as I hope he will recognise. The experience that we had with the TV switchover, which in some ways was even more fraught with difficulty, has been an outstanding success so far. One of the largest switchovers, in the Manchester area, recently went over without a hitch. We had a lot of preparation, help and assistance. We want to adopt a similar approach.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="100203113000022"></a>It is not just about the 50 per cent of listeners. We have also talked about DAB achieving the same coverage as FM, which is something like 95 per cent these days. We are well aware of the importance of that. I also point out another factor which I think is important. The prices of reasonable quality DAB radios have been coming further and further down. That is important for less advantaged parts of our population. We are aware of the concerns expressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="100203113000023"></a>We believe that the clauses have got it right. We understand the concerns, which is why I have taken time to give some further assurance. Given the breadth of the requirements to consult already proposed in the draft Bill and our commitment to consult widely before setting a date, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary. With the explicit assurances I have given, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="100203113000027"></a>This amendment is designed for two particular purposes: not only to explore some of the detail of this clause, which seeks to implement a very important part of the Bill, but to test the coherence of the Government's policies and objectives in this respect. On these Benches we recognise many of the benefits of moving from analogue to digital; of course we do. However, we believe the Government have been fundamentally poor in the way in which they have communicated their objectives and in the way in which they described both those and the processes involved in switching over.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="100203113000028"></a>We are particularly concerned about the impact on local FM radio and what one might call ultra-local radio in that respect. A great deal of reassurance is needed about the future of FM. It is not just purely about freeing up space on the analogue spectrum for FM by migration from analogue to digital. The Government need to explain other aspects too. Why are we adopting DAB rather than DAB plus, which would allow a much more local feel to our radio experience and enable many more ultra-local radio stations to migrate? The Government also need to explain-the Minister has made an attempt to do so-why the target of 2015 has been set.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="100203113000029"></a>There are other details involved. One of the great forms of reassurance that the Government have tried to give to ultra-local radio FM stations is this notion of a common electronic programme guide. That is a

What timescale is envisaged? The Government need to deliver much more clarity in this respect and other aspects. Will there be adequate supplies of radios that enable listeners to tune in to both FM and digital radio? It is fairly basic: will the domestic consumer be able to have access to those, or will most manufacturers switchover to pure digital?</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="100203113000030"></a>The availability of digital car radios is a particular concern. I shall illustrate where I believe there is some incoherence in this regard. It is almost as if two separate hands wrote Chapter 3b of the White Paper. That chapter is headed, "Radio: Going Digital". Paragraph 20 of that chapter states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="100203113000045"></a>"However, it has always been our intention that the ultra-local services which remain on FM after the Digital Radio Upgrade should only do so temporarily".</p>

<p><a name="100203113000039"></a>Later on, the paper-I leave the Minister to find his own copy-is written in very different terms. It talks about a much longer-term future for FM. Which is it? Will FM be a permanent or temporary part of the radio landscape? These things need sorting out as part of the Bill. Even if you talk to those intimately involved in the digital switchover you will not get a precise answer about whether FM is here for the long term.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="100203113000031"></a>As I understand it, technically, ultra-local radio is far better staying on FM almost in perpetuity, provided the two forms of spectrum can be afforded, and provided the receivers allow the receipt of both FM and digital for the foreseeable future. There is no particular reason why some of these ultra-local stations should indeed switch over. Why should they not be encouraged to stay where they are? That would seem to me to be a very coherent way of expressing government policy. However, of course, many operators want to have a broader canvas for their stations. That is entirely acceptable too. Where they wish to make that investment and have a broader scope for their radio services, that seems to be entirely right and proper.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="100203113000032"></a>The <I>Digital </I><I>Britain</I> White Paper talked about the triggers for the switchover to digital radio. In referring to those, the Minister said that it was not simply the case that half of all listening should be to digital and that the relevant date should not be set until national DAB coverage matches that of FM and 90 per cent of the population have access to local DAB. The clause we are discussing-this is what Amendment 238 is designed to do-does not refer to any of that. All it does is talk about the report submitted by Ofcom, to which the noble Lord, Lord Howard, referred. It does not give any direction to Ofcom. One assumes that Ofcom will refer to the government policy as set out in the White Paper, but there seems to be no duty on it to do that. That seems to constitute a gap in the provisions.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="100203113000033"></a>We on these Benches believe that the Government need at least to give reasons why some conditions are not appropriate. We do not necessarily believe that all of these additional conditions are the right ones, but we do believe that certain of those should be additional to those stated, so that all local stations have digital migration pathways. Currently, more than 120 stations lack viable digital migration pathways. All categories of commercial and BBC stations should be treated  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_271"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equally, creating a level playing field going forward. The switchover date-2015-is based on an assessment of DAB listening rather than digital listening, which includes digital television and the internet, as this will replace FM and AM as radio's broadcast backbone. People are listening more and more to radio over the internet.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="100203113000034"></a>As regards the whole issue of vehicle reception, I think that less than 1 per cent of cars can receive digital signal at the moment. I think the Government estimate that only 10 per cent of vehicles will be able to receive it in 2015. We are trying to get a more coherent policy and a switchover that accords more to the reality of what listeners are doing. There is absolutely no point in the Government being so far ahead of what listeners want to do that they create a reaction against their own plans.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="100203113000035"></a>Amendment 239 is another measure designed to test the earnest of the Government. The Government have rather arbitrarily decided that switchover should take place two years after notice of it is given. Amendment 241 seeks to change that. There are concerns about the speed of switchover. Amending the notice period would allow more time to solve the issues around consumer take-up, such as those involving vehicles, and would allow digital solutions to be provided for all stations which want them. A four-year period would be far more realistic in terms of recognising the considerable challenges involved in the digital switchover. Amendment 239 states that the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="100203113000046"></a>"must ensure that all commercial and BBC radio services broadcasting in the UK have the opportunity to switchover on the same date".</ul>
<p><a name="100203113000040"></a>That is another way of testing the Government's proposals in this respect. Are they saying that at the end of the day all these stations need to switch to digital, or are they saying that FM has a future in the long term? What is the purpose behind the switchover? It seems to me that the Government have not expressed their intentions very clearly. I hope that this is an opportunity for them to do so. I beg to move.</p>

However, he has set in that amendment probably rather an ambitious goal. Some may say that it is too ambitious. It may, of course, have the impact of delaying the switchover date from the much bandied-about year of 2015. However, as we heard from the Minister earlier, that is not a precise date. The amendment may also effectively force something of a reappraisal of how digital radio is rolled out between now and switchover. But, that said, I believe that neither of those consequences would be to the detriment of the well-being of the radio industry.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="100203113000037"></a>The noble Lord referred to Ofcom. In order to make switchover manageable and help local stations remain viable in these challenging economic times, Ofcom has proposed a series of defined areas within which stations in the same commercial family will have more flexibility to share resources and locations. As your Lordships will know, that has been welcomed as a helpful step by many of the large and small commercial stations. Nevertheless, it throws up anomalies,  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>especially where radio groups would be barred from broadcasting to some of their network from locations that are actually far closer to their listeners than those from which they are allowed to broadcast. I say this not to criticise Ofcom's sterling efforts in coming up with solutions to try to make life easier for these vital local stations. The regulator is trying to be flexible and responsive in a rapidly changing arena. Yet that is precisely the point. It is almost as if at the moment we are rushing towards a finishing line when the course has not even yet been chalked out. This amendment helpfully acknowledges that the route to an appropriate digital platform is not yet entirely clear, especially for many smaller stations.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="100203113000038"></a>I have concerns over the specific proposal that sets a target of two-thirds of listening on DAB before switchover simply because it does not quite recognise the mixed radio economy that we are moving towards, to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred. If a growing proportion of us are listening to radio via our computers, mobile phones and digital TV sets, with only a small remnant still listening on analogue, it would be unfortunate if the wording of primary legislation made it such that we could not set a switchover date just because DAB was specified as the only non-analogue platform. But, with those reservations, on the whole I support Amendment 238.</p>

<a name="100203114000060"></a><b><a name="100203-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100203114000419"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I will briefly add my support for these amendments. There clearly has to be a rethink on this whole area. There are so many different interests and people who have been hoping and planning. At Second Reading, I remember my enthusiasm for immediate digital switchover as far as radio was concerned. It would be a splendid way for me to be able to enjoy my journeys up and down to Warwickshire without having to fiddle around and change the frequency on the radio, which is presumably a fairly dangerous practice anyhow. So, although one may not agree with every word, this points out to the Government that there is going to have to be a more up-to-date assessment of where we are and how quickly, if at all, we are going to reach the desired goal of switchover and meet the needs of local radio stations, particularly the commercial ones.</p>

We agree that it is important for the Government to consider a wide range of issues and views before setting a date for digital switchover. We seem to be referring to 2015 as though we have set a date. I reiterate that that is a target. As with TV switchover, the announcement of a target date is essential in uniting the industry in creating the impetus to ensure that progress towards switchover conditions is made. For example, within six months of 2015 being published in the White Paper, progress with car manufacturers had advanced further than in the previous six years. We still believe that 2015 is an achievable deadline and the certainty of a timeframe is in the best interests of listeners and the industry as a whole. However, I stress that it is still a target. We expect broadcasters and network operators to work

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="100203114000062"></a>We do not believe it is appropriate to insert the level of detail proposed by this amendment into legislation as it would fail to grant sufficient flexibility to address the inevitable changes in the market over the next five years. As this amendment raises a number of themes, I will take each of the issues raised in turn. It was an omnibus address delivered with brilliant brio.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="100203114000063"></a>First, the proposed amendment requires a DAB network large enough to accommodate all commercial radio stations before a switchover date is nominated. We believe that this is the right ambition, but impractical in the short term. With over 50 BBC services, nearly 350 commercial stations, and 200 licensed community stations, the current DAB infrastructure cannot support a wholesale move to digital. We believe a mixed landscape of FM and DAB, as set out in the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper, is a better solution. It will allow small commercial stations and community radio stations to remain on FM, which was a point of concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. In the case of community radio stations, it will allow for more services to be launched. On the question of whether FM is temporary or permanent, FM is the right technology for community and small local radio stations for the foreseeable future, following switchover.</p>

We certainly see it for the foreseeable future following switchover. That is pretty generous. We are trying to reassure the noble Lord. It is the right technology for community and small local radio stations. We cannot predict exactly how technology will develop for ever and ever, but we are saying, "for the foreseeable future, following switchover". That is a pretty good guarantee.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="100203114000066"></a>Secondly, this amendment would require DAB networks in the UK to reach the same number of households as analogue. Again, we agree with the principle and we are working with the industry to secure this outcome as quickly as is feasible. However, the definition of analogue coverage is too broad, encompassing long wave, medium wave and FM. It also provides no clarity as to whether it is a high-quality stereo signal or a low-quality mono signal. This amendment would result in multiplex operators and broadcasters bearing the full cost of a near universal DAB network for the longest possible time.</p>

<a name="100203-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="100203114000067"></a>Thirdly, the amendment proposes to require that 67 per cent of all radio listening be to DAB before a switchover date can be set. We agree that the digital radio switchover should be market-led and dependent on the take-up and usage of digital radio. However, this criterion places too great an emphasis on DAB over other digital technologies. The issue is not whether listeners choose to consume radio via DAB, the internet or digital TV, but the extent to which they have access to digital radio technology and are using it. Also required in this amendment is that DAB receivers are  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_274"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>installed in 50 per cent of private and commercial vehicles. We believe there would be significant challenges in measuring success against such a criterion. In addition, such a legal requirement would fail to take account of the adoption of in-car radio converters or future technological developments. Just as we had the development of the digibox in relation to enabling analogue TVs to carry on working, so it is obvious that we will see the price of in-car converters come down and that technology developed. All DAB radios include FM: that was another point that was raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="100203114000068"></a>We are working with car manufacturers with the aim that by 2013, all radios sold with vehicles will be digitally enabled. There are already devices on the market that will convert an FM car receiver so that it can receive DAB, and the market in this area is likely to grow considerably. It is huge: there are millions of analogue car radios. We are trying to cover all the areas of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="100203114000069"></a>Amendment 239 would also require that all commercial and BBC stations have the opportunity to switch over on the same date. It removes the flexibility granted to the Secretary of State to nominate different switchover dates for different services. Although it remains the Government's intention that all services specified by the Secretary of State should switch over on the same date, flexibility is needed to ensure that the switchover can be delivered most appropriately for listeners. With TV, the gradual approach is working well, so we are making a plea here for flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="100203114000070"></a>Amendments 241 would increase the minimum notice period from two to four years. We believe that this would unnecessarily extend the costs of dual transmission for broadcasters, and slow down the rollout of the DAB network. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asked about our motivation. Part of it is the most effective use of the spectrum; another part is to ensure that people are given the best possible service. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said she had to fiddle with the knob on her car radio. It is time that she updated it to one with RDS, which will automatically change the frequency for her as she drives along. I cannot guarantee her a government handout, but it is well worth it.</p>

The advantage of DAB-plus over DAB is the greater capacity that it provides for services on the same frequency, allowing a digital multiplex to broadcast around 20 rather than 10 services, thereby giving more stations the opportunity to move to digital. However, we believe that the benefits of DAB-plus are more than outweighed by the negative impact on existing DAB listeners. Only a very small fraction of the 10 million digital receivers that have been sold are capable of receiving DAB-plus, and any technology change would make these receivers effectively redundant. That would significantly delay the switchover timetable and increase the time during which broadcasters would bear the burden of dual transmission costs. Nevertheless, the Government have been clear about their intention to promote receivers that are capable of receiving DAB-plus and other digital technologies that are used across Europe. This will protect receivers against any change of technology in the future. We are trying to take into account the concern in that area. I apologise if I put that over quickly, but it will be on the record.</p>

I also thank those who took part in the debate; the right reverend Prelate and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. Not every jot and tittle of the amendment necessarily carries all the weight that it should. We are looking for pointers from the Government. Although some of the White Paper sets out the conditions and criteria, they are not in the Bill and there is uncertainty, albeit among a minority of radio operators. The future of FM has not been made clear.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="100203114000076"></a>I take the words "foreseeable future" in these circumstances to mean semi-permanent. There is a fear that FM stations, "left behind" on analogue, will be second-class citizens who will not be there for long-they will be hustled across into digital-when actually, in terms of cost and reception, ultra-local radio is probably best left on FM. It may be that the Government wish to release that spectrum, have a fire sale and flog off FM to the highest bidder-I know not. The Government need to be crystal clear about those issues. The use of the "mixed landscape" wording by the Minister was very healthy; no wholesale move in the circumstances is healthy, as it has been described to us that digital will be a great advantage to the larger national radio stations but not to the smaller ones.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="100203114000077"></a>I understand what the Minister was saying about the vehicle aspect. I hope that he is correct in saying that the ability to convert to digital by various gizmos, which will not cost the public an arm and a leg, will be increasingly possible. I think he mentioned the 2015 gate but I do not know what percentage of in-car use was associated with that. Clearly, there is some considerable optimism about the switch taking place within the next three or four years. That is ambitious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="100203114000078"></a>On two years versus four years, I cannot help reflecting that the two-year period is more, not for the listeners' or the radio operators' convenience, but for the Government's convenience because they want a decision made and they want to be able to consider the

That is the impression given to date. In a sense, two years is a very aggressive period, once the notice has been given, in which to expect that migration to take place. That is the fear behind that short period. Basically it is for the Government's convenience rather than for allowing things to take place in an orderly fashion.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="100203114000079"></a>This has been a very useful debate. I thank the Minister for what he has said. Obviously, some reflection is required. We have all had an enormous amount of correspondence from radio operators and no doubt we shall reflect with them between now and Report about whether further tweaks are required to this part of the Bill.

I invite your Lordships to put yourselves in the shoes of someone running a small FM radio station, serving a population of 100,000 people in and around, let us say, King's Lynn. As it stands, that station's future seems to be to bid for a space on a local multiplex. That would mean that it would begin broadcasting to almost 600,000 people. Such a shift would significantly change the character of that station. Listeners from a much wider area would start to phone in to programmes and would, for instance, start to demand their own slice of news output. The station manager would be forgiven for wishing to stay on the FM band as long as possible, until a better solution was found for smaller stations to find a home on the digital spectrum.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="100203114000081"></a>Consider then the prospect of the only way of going digital to be to join an even larger regional multiplex which covers the whole of East Anglia and serves well over 1 million listeners. That is the kind of situation that is faced by a number of small commercial radio stations if digital rollout continues as planned. Their pathway towards a digital future seems shrouded in a kind of fog, partly because of the large size of DAB multiplex areas and the lack of capacity on some multiplexes. Forcing those small-scale stations to broadcast to much larger areas than their current coverage would alter their feel and alter their connection with their audience. It would undermine the integrity that they hold as local broadcasters and potentially damage their ability to service platforms which stimulate and reflect local democracy and social action. There is also a danger that counter-intuitively such stations would struggle to attract advertising spend from local businesses

So, socially and commercially, beaming local stations to regional audiences is, frankly, not in anyone's interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="100203114000082"></a>As for the lack of space on DAB in some areas of the country, take, for example, the multiplexes currently covering Humberside or, in my own area, of Manchester where there is virtually no space available. Even with just the larger stations currently on board, capacity is running out in some areas. I understand that some stations that gain access are broadcasting in mono rather than in stereo in order to preserve bandwidth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="100203114000083"></a>The limitations of DAB for local and community stations are well acknowledged by Ofcom. Indeed, it is already planning for small-scale commercial and community stations to stay on FM in the medium term as the most appropriate technology for those stations in terms of both coverage and cost. The vacation of FM band space by the removal of national and large local stations would free up more capacity for smaller stations. Ofcom sees this as a natural staging post in radio's digital evolution.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="100203114000084"></a>Nowhere, however, is this halfway house given a firm legal footing. In case my amendment is misinterpreted as a luddite attempt to hold back the march of progress, let me make clear that it is intended as a temporary but crucial platform to support the transition to digital of small-scale local stations, which not only serve geographically defined areas, but also identity-defined and interest-defined groups.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="100203114000085"></a>Your Lordships may remember the furore caused when in 1992, BBC Radio 4 proposed to transfer use of its long-wave frequency to a rolling news service. The BBC reckoned that FM reception was good enough and the vast majority of the country could pick it up without a problem. But those living in remote parts of the United Kingdom, and even in exceptionally hilly inland parts, knew different. The determination to push ahead with cutting Radio 4 from the long wave was met with purposeful if well-mannered resistance, as one might expect from Radio 4 listeners. In fact, I am told that the sight of 200 protestors in tweed and twinsets marching down Upper Regent Street was enough to help the BBC to see the error of its ways. Let us not make a similar mistake.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="100203114000086"></a>After all, FM had at that point been around for almost 40 years. We have had DAB for less than a decade. The future of local radio-which is so crucial to forging community cohesion and identity, and promoting local social action and democracy- should not be left to chance. That must mean embracing a multi-platform ecology which creates a pathway towards digital broadcasting for local radio, retaining space for them on FM until such time as a digital platform offers them the right environment to continue what they do best. I beg to move.</p>

I hope consideration will be given to that, because-and this is not intended as a pun-a signal is needed in this area. We need a very strong signal-not just a digital or political signal-to FM radio, to ultra-local radio, that they have a future which is secure. That is exactly what the right reverend Prelate, whom nobody could accuse of being a luddite, has advocated.</p>

I like that and it sets the pattern for the future rather well. Clearly, this amendment hits on the crucial area of what will happen in the mean time and what is to be done concerning FM. We need some reassurance on this point; I think the Minister said that it would be around indefinitely. At the moment, we know that Ofcom grants only short licences. There have been quite a number of complaints from the radio stations that not to have the certainty granted to them by, say, a 10-year licence means that their likelihood of failure is considerable. That side of things would be helped if the Minister could confirm that FM will definitely be there, and that licences can be given as people gradually go over to digital and more space on FM becomes available.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="100203114000089"></a>We know that there are minimal alternative uses for the FM spectrum besides transmitting radio. It is not therefore likely that the Treasury will want to make vast sums out of it, as it clearly did when it realised its potential. It has already had its fair share from that-or unfair share, depending on how you look at it. Please can we therefore have two assurances from the Minister? We should all try to move as fast as possible and with all encouragement towards the digital switchover, because we can see the disadvantages in having that laggard time that many seem to envisage. Indeed, one person giving us evidence today said that, concerning radio, there was really no possibility of a digital switchover; he was as dispirited as anyone could have been about the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="100203114000090"></a>Any form of encouragement that the Minister can give would be welcome, certainly on the future use of FM and on longer licences.

That is one reason why we believe that those stations are best served by continuing to broadcast on FM. We have also committed to retaining FM for radio after the digital radio switchover. Of course, the Government will not stop any station that wants to and can move to digital, but we will reserve capacity on FM for those which have no obvious route there.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="100203114000093"></a>I want to address a couple of the concerns that the right reverend Prelate expressed. How will we support those stations which remain on FM? In order to ensure that stations on FM can operate and compete with services on digital after switchover, the Government have already said that we are committed to establishing a combined electronic programme guide for radio. That will allow listeners to access stations via the station name, irrespective of the platform carrying the service. Listeners will therefore move seamlessly between bands, selecting stations simply by name; that is currently not the case when listening to FM and AM stations on an analogue radio receiver. We are working with the industry on that issue and encouraging its development.</p>

The Minister in the Commons, who recently announced his resignation, sadly, has given that assurance about the electronic programme, but no date was put on it. It is simply that they are working on it. This is a crucial aspect in retaining people's ability to tune in to FM.</p>

This is a genuine commitment. It is all part of the backdrop against which this debate is taking place. We have set 2015 as a target, but there is not a headlong rush to it. We are trying to ensure a number of things, and this is one of them. I can give a progress report on where we are: it is a clear commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="100203114000096"></a>The right reverend Prelate asked about making FM continue to be attractive to advertisers and listeners. The key to the switchover of radio will be establishing three distinct tiers of radio-local, regional and national-which will provide unique content and are sustainable in their markets. The services that will populate FM will have a distinct role in providing very local material and reflecting the communities they cover. Due to the very local nature of their content and the refocusing of the large regional stations, these services will benefit from less competition for local adverting funding. I hope that is of some help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="100203114000097"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked whether Ofcom will offer analogue licences for longer than five years. The duration of analogue licences is a matter for Ofcom. However, it has suggested that, subject to the outcome of the Bill, it will consult on this issue. We support this process as there is clearly a strong argument for allowing analogue licences over a longer licence period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="100203114000098"></a>I, too, rather like the elegant phrase "a multi-platform ecology". I wish I had thought of it myself. We have not included in the legislation a commitment to retain FM because the Bill is not intended to set out all the details of the digital radio switchover but to enable a  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_280"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>switchover to take place how and when that is appropriate. We agree with the right reverend Prelate's phrase "a multi-platform ecology"-imitation will soon be the sincerest form of flattery on this one. To do this, Clause 30 provides for changes in the licensing terms of those services for which it will no longer be appropriate to continue on analogue once the switchover date is nominated. For those licences where analogue broadcasting is the most appropriate or only means of broadcasting, these powers need not apply and their terms will be unaffected, including the right to broadcast on an analogue frequency. The continuation of FM is therefore already provided for in this legislation and should be read alongside the commitments in <I>Digital Britain</I>.</p>

We want this to be successful. We should take heart from how successfully we have handled the switchover to digital TV. That has been a success story. Lots of concerns were expressed at the beginning, and we had to work to ensure that people who had fears about handling the new technology were assisted. We got it right. I am not saying that that should be a blanket assurance for everything, but we should not forget how well we handled that. It gives us a good background of experience upon which we can build. I thank the right reverend Prelate for this part of the debate. I trust that the assurances that I have given will enable him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="100203114000103"></a>As those of us who have the privilege of sitting on the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications know, there is a huge difference between the switchover to digital television-this has indeed gone very smoothly, although it is not without its teething problems-and the digitalisation of radio. It has been made very clear to us in the evidence that we have received that the whole business of the digitalisation of radio is much more complex. While the Government and all the digital facilitators need to be congratulated

There are some very different and deeper issues that we must look at.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="100203114000104"></a>That said, I utterly agree with the Minister and all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate that we want to keep up the momentum. We really do want to go along with what the <I>Digital Britain</I> report has said and get ourselves going in the technological direction in which we are set. Unnecessary delays are certainly not welcome.</p>

<a name="100203-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="100203114000105"></a>Finally-I think the Minister alluded to this in an earlier debate-there is the issue of manufacturers moving towards products that use a combined station guide, rather as Freeview and satellite television do for television, so that people can choose stations by name, whatever the band they are using. This kind of mixed economy of stations, both analogue and digital, will be the simplest way of getting through the many complexities that are on our path.</p>

My concern is that old analogue radios that are no longer required should be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way. It is clear that many individual parts of such radios have a recycling value, and we do not want piles of radios to be disposed of in landfills or wherever else.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="100203114000108"></a>I read in a newspaper recently that it is likely that there are something like 2.4 radios per household, although I suggest there are a lot more. The older generation quite commonly have many more radios-in different rooms in the house and collected over many years. My wife and I definitely have more than 2.4 radios. Having to dispose of and replace radios could result in financial hardship for many people.</p>

That incentive should be based upon profit from the disposal of the radio. It could be-why not?-that the council will dispose of radios, and that they could give a ticket or voucher to the people handing in the radios, which they could then present to a retailer to go towards the cost of buying a new radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="100203114000110"></a>I hope that the Minister will consider this issue as something of great importance and concern to the older generation, and many who cannot afford to buy new radios, which they do not really feel that they should need. I beg to move.</p>

However, this issue should be considered before any switchover date is nominated. For obvious environmental reasons, a recycling or swap scheme would make sense, and it would be helpful if the Minister could explain whether such a scheme has been considered, and more importantly, who would fund it.</p>

In the context of what I thought I saw in the news-that the department for business was considering a scrappage scheme in this area-it would fit extremely well, if we were to know where the scrapping would take place and how it would be effected, if there were to be such a scheme. That would be an extremely quick way of moving things along, but I am not sure whether it was a rumour or fact that such a scrappage scheme was being contemplated by the department.</p>

There is some doubt as to how many radios are actually going to be available in this way, for two reasons. First, given the number of rooms that we have, a radio is quite a small thing and can be kept around. Secondly, manufacturers are getting very good at the prospect of putting in the chip, or whatever it is, and bringing it much more up to date, so that it can cope with the modern technology to a certain extent, if not quite reaching the digital heights that most of us are one day looking forward to. However, the conservation side of all of this is important, and we should take it very seriously.</p>

I agree entirely with the representation that he makes, that we need a coherent plan to address the environmental impact of the digital radio switchover. The difference between the Government and the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, is that we do not think that it needs to be in legislation. We will certainly need it-a plan will have to be developed. In the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper, we set out our commitment to a full cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment of the digital radio switchover programme before any date is set. These assessments will include a careful consideration of the environmental impact, on which

In fact, work has already begun. Three government departments-DCMS, BIS and Defra-are commissioning an independent assessment of the energy usage of digital versus analogue radio.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="100203114000115"></a>Of course, we have obligations too. The European Union's waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, which we implemented in 2006 by regulations, insists that producers of electrical goods are financially responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment. We know where the obligation is and we know the work that needs to be done.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="100203114000116"></a>As to what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, I always like the fact that the Liberal Benches quite often, when a constructive idea emerges, automatically assumes that it is the Government's idea and initiative. The only problem with that assumption is that it may also involve government expenditure, which raises a different matter. I assure the noble Lord that we are quite interested in his idea of the scrappage scheme. This is an industry initiative and we would need to see details before we could comment further on how that should work. But it is a reflection of the fact that the industry knows where its obligations and its interests lie.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="100203114000117"></a>Perhaps I am looking a little negative, which is never my wont on matters of this kind. Let me make the obvious point-my noble friend Lord Young commented on this on a previous amendment-that we have managed the television switchover in a limited area thus far. We are rather proud of the fact that the planning that went into that and the execution of it is throwing up a relatively small number of problems, sufficient for the position to win general plaudits.</p>

They had to buy a new box to go with that television set. That is very different from radio, although I hope that the industry is looking-it has already done it for the car radio-at a device that would allow a person to listen to digital radio over their existing analogue radio.</p>

I understand entirely that radios create the problem of disposal, which is why the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, has raised the issue. As we know, there will be no little set box placed on top of a radio. There will be disposal, which is an important issue. We are not convinced that financial incentives are necessary. We will look at the matter. No financial incentive was required in the digital television switchover as regards disposal, but my noble friend identified that somewhat different factors were at stake.</p>

The environmental impact is a key part of the digital radio switchover planning.

Let me say that there may be a case for a help scheme, but we are not sure about that yet. What we are sure about is that the obligation for disposal rests with the industry, which therefore is where the costs lie. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, indicated when he mentioned the scrappage scheme that that is a sure indication of the extent to which the industry is looking ahead to a date with a certain predictability about it-not a month or a year, but we know that the process needs to be put in hand-and is planning accordingly.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Cotter, made the point that there are something like 2.4 radios in his household. I always thought that that was the number of children in the average United Kingdom family. Certainly most households have more than one radio, apart from the impoverished or those who live in 12th-century buildings where a radio would look entirely out of place in the décor. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, may be shaking his head because he would have nothing quite so modern and intrusive as a radio in his home. For the rest of the community, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, is probably more typical, and therefore the issue of the disposal of radio sets is a real one, and I am glad that he raised it.</p>

I also thank the Minister for accepting that this is an important matter. It is encouraging that the Minister has said it is important and could well need to be addressed at some future date. I would then expect the Government to follow this through. Going back to the discrete point about the financial aspect, because many in the older generation require radios in different rooms, it would be a financial hardship to have to replace them all. The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, and others said that this is different from digital TV where a box can put on top of the set. With the radio, a number of items have to be replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100203120000002"></a>This Bill provides powers for the implementation of digital radio switchover-a comparable process to digital television switchover which is well under way across the country and due to finish in 2012. Disabled people currently face significant and sometimes insurmountable barriers to accessing digital technologies and services, with blind and partially sighted people facing more challenges than most. The internet, digital television and digital radio all present real opportunities for blind and partially sighted people if action is taken now. However, if not designed with accessibility in mind, these developments will all too soon become further barriers to blind and partially sighted people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100203120000003"></a>The digital revolution is happening more quickly than anyone imagined possible. As it gathers pace the digital divide continues to widen for blind and partially sighted people, distancing them from new services and losing access even to existing ones. The ambitions of <I>Digital Britain</I><I></I>cannot be realised if the Government and industry fail to take steps to develop and deliver new products and services that are accessible to blind and partially sighted people. This Bill could go some way to resolving some of the fundamental issues around accessibility and make further progress on the journey to delivering digital inclusion and digital equality to some of the most excluded people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100203120000004"></a>Research shows that radio plays a fundamental role in providing entertainment, information, inclusion and quality of life for blind and partially sighted people, with more than 91 per cent regularly listening to the radio and more than 80 per cent owning a radio set themselves. As your Lordships might imagine, many blind and partially sighted people rely on the radio, rather than the television, to access news and current affairs, follow sporting events, enjoy music and of course "The Archers".</p>

Digital radio switchover has the potential to improve the quality of radio broadcasting for blind and partially sighted consumers through increased choice and better sound quality. However, current proposals risk excluding blind and partially sighted listeners even from existing services if digital radio sets are not accessible in their operation. Many analogue radios use buttons and tactile dials for tuning. New DAB radios rely on touch screens or inset buttons that can pose real difficulties for visually impaired users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100203120000006"></a>Digital radio switchover relies on the purchase of new digital radio equipment which is currently not accessible to blind and partially sighted people as digital radio sets require the use of electronic programme guides-visual menus-to use the equipment. As has been the case for digital TV switchover, it looks unlikely that accessible digital radio equipment will be produced without government intervention to stimulate the market or to procure accessible radio sets directly. Accessibility is vital. Research shows that visually impaired people are much better able to use radio equipment independently if it has audio output that provides navigational and programme information on core functions, such as channel, station and frequency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="100203120000007"></a>Digital radio will offer a new type of service that requires visual interaction with a screen on the radio to access information such as numbers of phone-in shows, the station, its wavelength and details of music and artist. Presenters will be less likely to give this kind of information, since the equipment will do the job for sighted people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="100203120000008"></a>When the digital TV switchover began, a help scheme was introduced to ensure that older and disabled people or those on certain benefits could continue to access digital television. The help scheme provided a set-top box at a fixed cost, which was installed by a technician, who also demonstrated how to use the box and access the new channels. The equipment provided also met a set of requirements-the core receiver requirements-which laid out the minimum accessibility and usability standards for the equipment, which included ensuring accessibility to disabled people. Unlike the digital TV switchover, there is as yet no help scheme proposed to assist qualifying members of the public such as older or disabled people with obtaining and using digital radio equipment. That could mean that older and disabled people would have no support during the transition to digital radio.</p>

As part of its <I>Are You Really Listening</I><I>?</I> research, the RNIB, of which I am a vice-president, spoke with manufacturers at various points along the supply chain to establish whether digital audio radios can be easily produced with integrated accessibility features to enhance usability.

The manufacture of goods is also excluded from the Disability Discrimination Act and has not been included in the Equality Bill, which means that disabled people have no access to legal redress if a company fails to take into account disabled customers' needs when developing new products. If vulnerable groups are to be enabled to migrate successfully to digital radio, it is fairly clear that a government help scheme will be needed.</p>

That is always a reasonable question, but in this case I am happy to say that there is a ready answer. As we know, the television help scheme is under spent. I know that there is a long line of people queuing up to tell us how to spend the money, but I submit that there could not be a more obvious candidate than a digital radio switchover help scheme. I beg to move.</p>

I went to a conference a few days ago, part of which was devoted to looking at some of the lessons learnt from the TV digital switchover. By and large, because it was planned properly and had a help scheme, although perhaps not as extensive as some of us would have wanted, it has been a success. Certainly, the Granada switchover, which was one of those highlighted, seems to have gone very smoothly. As we know and as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said, the full amount of the money allocated to that digital switchover was not spent, which was a result of the planning and the successful help scheme. The unsung hero in many respects in all this is the voluntary sector; many of us forget that Help the Aged and Age Concern-I am not sure of the new name, or which way round it goes-have been very instrumental in supplementing the Government's help scheme. All that is to say that without a properly thought-through help scheme, I do not believe that the audio digital switchover will be successful, and I hope that the Government take that to heart.</p>

It is clearly crucial to the effective way in which this switchover can be completed, with minimum suffering-I think we can put it as high as that-for those who rely so permanently on their radios. I hope we are going to hear more on that. He has also identified the source of funding for this important scheme. No doubt the Minister will be able to confirm that there is money, and it can be spent in this way.</p>

A couple of years ago, many other noble Lords and I spoke very strongly when such a help scheme was proposed for television;

The noble Lord has spoken very powerfully and informatively about what would be required for the radio help scheme.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="100203120000014"></a>I have only one hesitation; I may be alone in this, and the Minister may be able to guide me in what the legislative processes are. The fact is that at this very moment, the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications has the help scheme on its agenda and is taking evidence about it. My question is simply for guidance from the Minister: I am not sure about the timing. On the face of it, it would make sense if it were possible to hear what the Select Committee is saying on this issue in order to be able to feed that into the Bill and, I hope, strengthen the points that the noble Lord, Lord Low, has made. However, I do not know whether our report will come out in time.</p>

<a name="100203-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="100203120000016"></a>In the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper, we committed to conducting a full impact assessment, including a cost-benefit analysis, of a digital radio switchover. Our experience from the TV switchover shows that such an analysis is essential in identifying which listeners, if any, would be disproportionately disadvantaged by the switchover, and consequently whether a help scheme is necessary and what its scope might be.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100203-0015.htm"/>


<a name="100203-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="100203120000017"></a>I emphasise that this was the right process for TV; in a way I am touching on the point raised by the right reverend Prelate about the Select Committee. We had the cost-benefit analysis and full impact assessment, and the TV help scheme was established and implemented without any statutory duty such as that proposed in this amendment. We recognised the need to assess the situation; we had a full impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis and we agreed that if it proved to be necessary-the noble Lord, Lord Low, might well be right-the help scheme would be established. In short, we accept that a precedent has been set for a help scheme, but it is too early to say whether such a scheme is needed for radio. However, if there is a case, we will take steps to introduce a scheme to support those disadvantaged listeners. There is no way that we want to deepen any digital divide so that those listeners would be disadvantaged by the introduction of digital radio.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="100203120000018"></a>The amendment also raises the issue of the usability of digital radio devices. I want to respond to a concern that the noble Lord, Lord Low, raised in relation to the question of whether the visually impaired or blind would be disadvantaged by the complex nature of digital radio receivers. Those of us who are using digital radio receivers at the moment know that there is a strip of text that gives, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said, information about the station and often about the programme. It is a useful development.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="100203120000019"></a>However, I can reassure the noble Lord that recent developments in DAB technology have sought to address the needs of vulnerable groups and listeners with disabilities. Using iVOX technology, DAB digital radios can tell listeners station names, the time and alarm settings. It can even talk users through setting alarms  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_289"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or presets. With voice prompts, clear instructions and a CD-based audio user guide, developments with iVOX in DAB radio sets will ensure that radio remains easy to use and accessible to blind people. We will work with manufacturers and consumer groups to encourage the implementation of these technologies into affordable devices.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="100203120000020"></a>In the mean time, we have invited the Consumer Expert Group, which advised the Government on the TV switchover, to extend its role to include the digital radio switchover programme. That is another assurance that we are making the maximum effort to assess the need for the help scheme.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="100203120000021"></a>I hope that I have assured the noble Lord, Lord Low, that there is no way that the Government would want to see disabled people disadvantaged by digital radio switchover. We have the right processes in place to assess the need and will support a help scheme if that is what is required. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Low, will feel capable of withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I apologise for intervening in the Committee at such a late stage in discussions on the Bill when I did not take part in Second Reading. There is quite a lot I would have liked to have said at Second Reading but I was unfortunately on the other side of the Atlantic that day, so I apologise for this late intervention. I am grateful for the opportunity to intervene and for the consideration that has been given to the case that I made.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="100203120000023"></a>I was interested in the point about the Select Committee. If it is not too late, it would obviously be useful if groups representing the disabled and the elderly were to give evidence to that Select Committee. I hope that its report may be able to influence the debates on the Bill as it proceeds through Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="100203120000024"></a>I was surprised to hear the Minister say that there was no statutory basis for the digital television switchover scheme because although there was no provision for it in the Communications Act 2003, there was a separate Act that went through Parliament in 2007 that made provision for a digital television switchover scheme. That is significant because that Act provided for the research to be undertaken that would facilitate and enable such a scheme. The research undertaken was on the likely beneficiaries-the numbers of people who would be likely to need additional help with switchover, their characteristics and so forth. Quite a lot of the work that would need to be done for the impact assessment has probably already been undertaken and there would be quite a ready read-across from the one to the other, although I do not in any sense deny that there will be-</p>

I look forward to getting the Minister's letter. I was also very interested and encouraged in what the Minister had to say about iVOX technology. I know about this technology. I have a couple of digital radio sets that employ it and give an audio output of the kind of information that is necessary to use these radio sets effectively. As I said, the problem is not that this is impossible; it is that the market seems to be incapable of delivering it.</p>

<a name="100203-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="100203120000028"></a>It is no longer possible to get the kind of radio set that I am talking about. It was marketed for a short while. Indeed, it was very successful among visually impaired people but, from the manufacturer's point of view, it did not sell in sufficient numbers to warrant continuing with the production lines. So the technology is there but the market is not. If we are to get over that problem, some government intervention is needed.</p>

Now is surely the time for the Congolese Government, with the support of regional Governments and the international community, to take the necessary steps to bring the conflict to an end once and for all. Her Majesty's Government, as the largest bilateral donor, giving £100 million last year, rising to £130 million in 2010, are well placed to take a lead, if the political will is there to support such an effort.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000004"></a>Some of the United Kingdom's most active NGOs, Congolese civil society organisations and the APPG on the Great Lakes Region of Africa are leading a campaign called "Congo Now". The Congo deserves to have a much higher political profile. The UK substantially supported the DRC's first democratic elections in 2006 and we have continued to invest in and support the democratic process since then. It is vital that Congo's next presidential and legislative elections should take place in 2011, following local elections planned for 2010, which have been delayed since 2006.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000005"></a>The war in the east of the country, however, threatens to prevent any future development of the country as a whole. Long-term economic development and infrastructure building remain impossible with the country in conflict. If it worsens, or weakens the Congolese state further, it presents a serious risk to the region as a whole. The LRA has now begun to make inroads into the DRC, with conflict erupting in areas other than the east, particularly in Dongo to the north-west. The Congo is teetering on a knife edge.

On the other, particularly as elections approach and tensions mount, lies the route back into civil war.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000006"></a>Many observers confirm that MONUC remains a necessary presence, providing protection for civilians in the DRC while the Congolese army, the FARDC, is being trained and reformed. It is, however, evident that a military solution alone will not solve the crisis in the DRC. A more joined-up approach is needed and many observers are looking to the Rwandan Government to do more to facilitate that. In this context, will the Minister tell us what steps the UK has taken, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to encourage the Governments of both the DRC and Rwanda to develop and implement options for temporary resettlement of FDLR combatants and their families, either within the Congo or in a third country?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000007"></a>The new MONUC mandate places a much heavier emphasis on the protection of civilians, a move that has been widely welcomed by the international community, but there is still more to be done to make MONUC a more effective peacekeeping force. Operations must be planned jointly between the FARDC and MONUC-something that Kimia II often failed to achieve. The joint protection teams of military and civilian personnel working together have proved to be highly effective but have had logistical and human resources problems. MONUC staff have mooted creating joint operating protection bases, allowing civilians to be stationed in remote operating areas and to work for more sustained periods and more effectively with military personnel. Will the Government make representations to Alan Doss, the special representative of the UN Security Council, to seriously consider this proposal while he is conducting a strategic review of MONUC and before he completes his report, which is due to be submitted to the United Nations Security Council by 1 April 2010?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000008"></a>Furthermore, under the aegis of UNSCR 1894 to advance and ensure protection of civilians, will the Government consider deploying a civilian protection expert group to eastern Congo to inquire into and rapidly report on civilian protection needs and challenges? The need for more effective protection is self-evident. The UNHCR reports that, since December, more that 15,500 new IDPs have been registered in North Kivu, around Kitchanga and north-west of Goma, adding to the appalling estimate of 2.1 million IDPs in the eastern DRC.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000009"></a>There is a lack of coherent and co-ordinated information about attacks against civilians and abuses against children. There is a lack of monitoring of the measures taken by MONUC to implement its strategy on the protection of civilians. A civilian protection expert group could develop measures for the protection of civilians in the DRC and promote humanitarian access and assistance. This would be an important step towards ending impunity for serious crimes in violation of international law.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000010"></a>It is essential that MONUC has the means to carry out its mandate and is provided with the rapid response capabilities and intelligence-gathering support that the mission has requested to meet its new mandate, which strongly encourages enhanced regular information sharing about the LRA. In the light of the new mandate, what

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000011"></a>A main driver of the conflict in the eastern DRC has been the trafficking of mineral and natural resources, with the proceeds controlled by rebel groups and in some cases by the Congolese army itself. The UN Group of Experts report of December 2009 exposed links between UK companies such as Amalgamated Metal Corporation and the purchase of "conflict minerals" sourced in mines controlled by rebel groups and then bought by UK-registered companies. Massive human rights abuses against local civilian populations result. The Global Witness report <I>Faced with a Gu</I><I>n, </I><I>What </I><I>C</I><I>an</I><I> You Do? </I>and the Enough Project's <I>Digging In: Recent Developments on Conflict Minerals</I> both clearly highlight this.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000012"></a>Have the Government raised with the Congolese Government the question of FARDC units and commanders engaging in mineral trafficking? Do the Government support the call by Human Rights Watch and others for the international community to assist with measures to strengthen military justice in the DRC and for the creation of a special chamber to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law? Can the Minister confirm that the Government have met their obligations under UNSCR 1857 to submit to the sanctions committee details of individuals and companies registered in the UK whose trade in conflict minerals is helping to fund armed groups in the eastern DRC?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000013"></a>The United States and Canada are developing draft legislation for disclosure and transparency in mining, oil and gas extraction activities, with the US highlighting precious mineral mining in the DRC such as columbite-tantalite, cassiterite and wolframite. Earlier this month, Norway became the first OECD country to disclose its oil and gas revenues under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. What action are the Government taking to speed the implementation of more effective methods of monitoring and controlling supply chains used by UK firms operating in developing countries? What assistance are the Government providing to the DRC to develop and adopt similar national legislation requiring the performance of extraterritorial due diligence, particularly within the Great Lakes region, to international standards?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000014"></a>In this regard, the Government of the DRC signed the EITI in 2008 and pledged validation by March 2009. Discussions between DRC officials and the all-party parliamentary group have revealed that the DRC will not be ready to validate the EITI as planned. What discussions has the Minister had with his Congolese counterparts in this respect? Do the Government have any plans to further support the DRC's validation of the EITI?</p>

<p><a name="10020383000015"></a>The £6 billion collaboration agreement between the Government of the DRC and the Chinese Government in mid-2009 has raised serious concerns, not least with Members of the Congolese Parliament. Complaints have been made to the APPG over the lack of information on the contract signed between the two Governments and the lack of transparency in the proposed management

What guarantees have the Government received from the Congolese Government about the transparency of the Sino-Congolese deal and the management of the income to the DRC?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000016"></a>The recent report from the UN Group of Experts on human rights concerns and security sector reform made it clear that diaspora FDLR leaders based in Europe are active in the decision-making for rebel groups operating in the DRC and are providing financial assistance through money transfers. Some Governments have made moves to arrest key known rebel leaders, but the UK has been criticised for withholding information about telephone calls made between FDLR leaders in the UK and commanders in the DRC. Will the Minister comment on whether the information requested by the UN Group of Experts regarding the FDLR leadership based in the UK has now been provided?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000017"></a>The Government of the DRC are being pressed to establish a vetting mechanism of human rights records in the appointment process to senior ranks within the FARDC resulting from the integration of armed groups into the army. Those suspected of committing violations should be immediately removed. The International Red Cross reports that four out of five women who go to their clinics for help in the DRC after being assaulted say that their assailant was a member of an armed group, either part of the government forces or a member of a rebel group. What measures are the Government taking to ensure that there is a strong human rights element in security sector reforms in the DRC, with measures to ensure that MONUC disengages support for FARDC units that are allegedly responsible for human rights abuses?</p>

It would be right for noble Lords, in thanking him, also to thank the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes for the work that it has done over many years in ensuring that Members of both Houses of Parliament are aware of the unfolding and continuing tragedy in Congo.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000019"></a>I last visited the DRC in 2004. Some 5 million people have died there since 1998; it is the most deadly conflict since World War II. The United Nations says that the amount of sexual violence is higher in the DRC than in any other country; more than 500,000 women have been raped, with an average in the east of the country of 40 women raped every single day in South Kivu. The extraordinary humanitarian work of Dr Denis Mukwege in South Kivu's "City of Joy", whose daughters describe him as a "doctor without borders", as outlined in the <I>Times</I> on 28 January, stands both as a rebuke to the world and as an inspiration.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000020"></a>Sometimes people ask what needs to be done to save Congo-more precisely, what the United Kingdom could and should do to help. I have four comments to make on that today. First, we should continue to help to drive forward the long overdue political dialogue between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Hutus living in eastern Congo. Military operations  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against these groups have not been able to dismantle them but instead have created massive retaliation against civilians-the case of Kimia II speaks for itself.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000021"></a>In the same way that the Congolese Government have been opening negotiations with Congolese rebel groups, Her Majesty's Government should encourage the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda to open political dialogue with their respective countries' rebel groups in order to stabilise the Congo and Great Lakes region. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what progress is being made to resettle the FDLR combatants, as was agreed by the Governments of Rwanda and Congo in the Nairobi communiqué of 2007. As Alan Doss, the UN special representative, draws up his report on the work of MONUC, to be submitted by 1 April, are we pressing for the better planning of operations between FARDC and MONUC, for the sharing of intelligence information about the whereabouts of key figures wanted for war crimes, for the creation of joint protection teams for civilians and for more resources, particularly helicopters? Perhaps the Minister will also take the opportunity to make clear our continued support for the important work that MONUC does in the DRC.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000022"></a>Secondly, we must address the hidden obstacle to peace, something that the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, referred to. Specific grievances might have sparked specific episodes of fighting, but hidden below this is the more fundamental question: the control of easily appropriable and highly valuable natural resources by armed groups and national armies from neighbouring countries. That remains the biggest obstacle to long-term peace in the region. The Congo has more diamonds, more gold, more cobalt, more coltan and more uranium-to name only some of its phenomenal assets-than any country in Africa. In spite of the lamentable catalogue of crimes against humanity that are taking place, Congo probably remains Europe's and America's biggest supplier of uranium, coltan, cobalt and tin.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000023"></a>We need to deploy every possible diplomatic, financial and military means to end the looting of Congolese resources, which allows armed groups to recruit from their territory and fuel the wars in Congo. When did we last raise these issues with the Governments of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda? How far have we reached with legislation in the United Kingdom, like that in the United States-the Congo Conflict Minerals Act 2009-to pave the way for legitimate companies to operate with transparency and social responsibility?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000024"></a>Resolution 1896, adopted by the Security Council on November 30 last year, mandates the Group of Experts to come up with recommendations for guidelines on the exercise of due diligence to prevent indirect support to armed groups through the exploitation and trafficking of natural resources in the DRC. Can the Minister tell us more about the timetable for the implementation of these guidelines?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000025"></a>Thirdly, throughout the Congo we must surely promote education for all. Education is said to be the cornerstone of personal, social and economic well-being of individuals and a vaccine against the social, historical and political ignorance that often breaks harmony and peace within and between communities. The Congo has a population of around 60 million people, 50 per cent of whom are  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>estimated to be under the age of 18. One in two is said to be unschooled, 100,000 sleep rough on the streets, 10,000 have been recruited into armed groups and another 10,000 live in virtual slavery, mining natural resources for armed groups for as little as $5 a month, while the vast majority live in dire poverty.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000026"></a>The education of women-empowering them and helping them to rise to positions of leadership-should be central to our approach to development. I recently met officials at the Foreign Office to discuss the DRC and tabled a number of Questions, particularly about the position of the so-called shegues, or street children, who are imprisoned at Angenga and Buluwo prisons. What assessment has been made of conditions in those prisons? Can the Minister say how many street children are estimated to live on the streets of Kinshasa? How many are still under arms? The Government recently gave me figures about the funds allocated for schools and education. What percentage of our aid programme does this represent?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000027"></a>Fourthly and lastly, on impunity, to which the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, referred, the Congolese Government comprise military, government and parliamentary officials responsible for dozens of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, as Anneke Van Woudenberg of Human Rights Watch put it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10020383000087"></a>"In Congo, if someone starts an armed group or kills people, they have a better chance of becoming a senior minister or a general than being put behind bars".</p>

<p><a name="10020383000028"></a>I remain to be convinced that a group of people who have achieved political power because of involvement in mass killings and who have used sexual atrocities as weapons of war will ever successfully heal or lead a nation if they are permitted to carry out such atrocities with impunity. As in South Africa, there must be a process of truth and justice. Without it, reconciliation will never be possible.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000029"></a>I hope that the Minister in his reply will tell us what is happening about the extradition of Bosco Ntaganda, for whom there is an International Criminal Court warrant outstanding. When did we last discuss his case with the Congolese? What discussions have the Government had with the Government of Rwanda about bringing Laurent Nkunda, captured in January of last year, to trial and about arresting and bringing to trial Joseph Kony of the LRA? I am sure that we will hear more about that case from my noble friend Lady Cox.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000030"></a>I conclude by saying that we are all agreed that the situation in the Congo is extremely grave: it is a nation in ruin, suffocating in its own people's blood. In an open letter to the Prime Minister, President Obama and others, Vava Tampa, director of Save the Congo, in words that struck me forcefully, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10020383000088"></a>"A peaceful Congo is critically important for the citizens of DRC and the whole Great Lakes region".</p>

<p><a name="10020383000031"></a>That is a message that the whole world needs to hear.</p>

<p><a name="10020383000032"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10020383000107"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for introducing this important debate. The unrest in eastern Congo is a chronicle of yet another region in Africa that has the mineral and  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agricultural wealth to be self-reliant but has never been able to achieve lasting peace.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000033"></a>The conflict in the region is about cultural identity and intolerance. It has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in which millions of internally displaced persons have been forced to leave their homes and innocent civilians are living in constant fear for their lives. The lawlessness in the region is indicative of a country where state institutions that should uphold law and order are desperately ineffective. Corruption permeates all levels of authority. The failure of the Amani peace programme to initiate a strategy for peace in North Kivu illustrates the importance of properly functioning state institutions to any regional initiative.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000034"></a>The militia are violating women as a means of exerting control, humiliation and submission. The abuses in this region are said to account for the majority of the work carried out by international aid organisations. The main culprits in this violent crime are the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda-FDLR-the Lord's Resistance Army and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, or FARDC, who perpetrate more than 90 per cent of the sexual abuses in eastern Congo. They are violating women, young girls and infants as young as three years of age. The level of brutality is alarming and leaves victims with physical and psychological wounds. There is a stigma attached to rape which results in many victims being ostracised from mainstream society in several parts of the region. The majority of victims are therefore reluctant to report their abuse for fear of rejection by their communities.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000035"></a>The militia groups in the region are a persistent danger to all citizens, but especially to women and children in eastern Congo. I strongly welcome the decision taken by the UN Security Council to improve the strategy among its forces in the region to protect citizens from militant attacks. Reports suggest that a significant number of abuses perpetrated against vulnerable citizens in the Congo are not being reported. What recent reports has the Minister received from the Congolese Government concerning the safety of women and children in eastern Congo?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000036"></a>Militia groups are still recruiting child soldiers in alarming numbers. The families of these children are often killed on the spot if they attempt to resist the advances of militants. The Congolese Government adopted the law on the protection of the child, but the departments that have been tasked with implementing the law and upholding the rights of children are ineffective. Children in eastern Congo are born into disadvantage, as deprivation and abuse are commonplace. The UK Government and their international partners must exert greater pressure on the Congolese Government to protect and uphold the rights of infants and young citizens as a matter of urgency.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000037"></a>The UK was criticised in a recent United Nations Group of Experts report on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo for failing to provide information about telephone calls made to UK numbers from Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda military satellite phones and for failing to provide information about payments made to the FDLR website, a point  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also made by the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey. It is clear that the Rwandan rebels are using these funds to co-ordinate and manage their activities in the region. What steps are the Government taking, along with their European partners, to apprehend and arrest FDLR leaders and supporters who are living in the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000038"></a>The lawyer of Laurent Nkunda has recently stated that the former leader of the National Congress for the Defence of the People, or CNDP, is prepared to face trial for alleged war crimes or go into exile as a means of ending his detention without charge in Rwanda. The UN has accused Nkunda and the CNDP of crimes ranging from recruiting child soldiers to sexual violence during his leadership. As the biggest donor to the DRC and the second largest to Rwanda, what plans do Her Majesty's Government have to act on this recent development?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000039"></a>The situation in eastern Congo is an immense tragedy. General elections are to be held next year in the DRC in the absence of United Nations observers. This is of great concern, since corruption and violence are rife. I would like to see the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region take a more substantial role in bringing stability to eastern Congo. Failure to make an impact will result in many citizens fleeing across the border to Rwanda, which is already Africa's most densely populated nation. The absence of a strong state is the main barrier to peace in the region. The Government and institutions are seen as being remote by the vast majority of citizens, who, as a result, often turn to the militants for protection and survival. A lasting solution to the conflict in eastern Congo will not be achieved without reforming the security sector and installing a properly functioning judiciary.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000040"></a>Finally, eastern Congo's mineral wealth continues to play a vital role in sustaining the activities of militant groups. Recent reports have shown a direct link between British companies and minerals obtained from mines that are controlled by militias in the region. The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, referred to this in his speech. This evidence suggests that the UK is in breach of the UN Security Council resolution that states that countries must provide details of organisations that are purchasing minerals from militant groups in eastern Congo. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee what steps Her Majesty's Government will take to ensure that this information is given to the UN sanctions committee in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="10020383000041"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10020383000108"></a>Baroness Cox:</b> My Lords, I, too, warmly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, on initiating this debate, which is particularly timely given the critical situation in the DRC and other countries in the region. My small NGO, HART, or the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust, has been working in southern Sudan and northern Uganda, where we have witnessed the havoc created by the Lord's Resistance Army-the LRA-in those countries. Therefore, I hope that a contribution that highlights the problems caused by the LRA may be helpful in understanding this aspect of the problems facing the DRC today.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100203-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000042"></a>We were working in northern Uganda while the LRA was still creating terror in that region. For 20 years it killed and maimed innocent civilians, displaced more than 1.5 million people and abducted at least 25,000 children, subjecting them to the utmost brutality and forcing them to become child soldiers to fight against the Ugandan army. Eventually, a ceasefire was negotiated for northern Uganda, but the LRA remains a threat to the people of eastern DRC, southern Sudan and parts of the Central African Republic. In Sudan, Human Rights Watch has reported continuing LRA attacks throughout 2009 in central and western Equatoria. October reports confirm this, citing a growing number of abductions by the LRA, including those of children. These attacks have particularly serious implications, since they create fear and instability at a time when the people of southern Sudan face many challenges.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000043"></a>The war instigated by the National Islamic Front regime in 1989 left 2 million dead and 4 million displaced. A comprehensive peace agreement has brought some respite from fighting, but the people are desperately trying to rebuild their shattered land and lives. The CPA also provides for a referendum in which the people of southern Sudan would vote whether to remain part of a united Sudan or to secede. However, there is a fear that the north, which does not want the south to secede, might reignite conflict to prevent the referendum and/or secession. Therefore, there are also great fears among the local people that the LRA might be used for this purpose.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000044"></a>In the DRC itself the LRA is seriously destabilising the fragile peace. The UNHCR released a report on 21 December 2009 that describes how, between September 2008 and June 2009, at least 1,200 people were killed and 1,400 people abducted in an LRA rampage, including some 600 children and 400 women, and at least 230,000 people were displaced. According to a CAFOD field office report, LRA attacks on 17 December in Isiro diocese forced 50,000 people to flee their villages. Reportedly, 30 people were killed, many houses burnt and a number of women abducted.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000045"></a>Numerous military offensives over the past year have failed to bring an end to the LRA's campaign of violence across the Great Lakes region. For example, Operation Lightning Thunder reportedly cost the Government of Uganda £10.5 million sterling. According to the Ugandan Chief of Defence Forces, the operation rescued 195 abductees, but at exceptional civilian cost.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000046"></a>The notorious Christmas massacres were essentially LRA reprisal attacks in response to that operation. In those attacks, 150 Congolese civilians were killed by the LRA on Christmas Day alone and, according to Human Rights Watch, more than 620 people, 160 of whom were children, were killed throughout the operation. Charles Arop, who commanded operations at the time of the Christmas massacre, has subsequently surrendered, and a senior commander, Bok Abudema, known to be second-in-command to Joseph Kony, was reportedly killed by Ugandan forces in the Central African Republic last week. Despite these developments, LRA attacks continue across the region, posing an increasingly destabilising threat.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000047"></a>As has been mentioned, the MONUC mandate specifically calls on regional Governments to co-ordinate efforts to tackle the LRA, strongly encouraging  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information sharing and requesting the UN Secretary-General to encourage more joined-up initiatives across UN missions in the region to combat the rebels. May I ask the Minister what conversations Her Majesty's Government have had with colleagues in regional Governments to encourage a more joined-up regional approach? Are they willing to make stronger representations at Security Council level to support further regional planning and co-ordination to bring stability to the DRC, Sudan and the region?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000048"></a>Porous borders between the DRC, neighbouring Sudan and other countries, combined with a weak state security sector, allow the LRA to roam and attack civilians freely across these countries. Have Her Majesty's Government made any further representations to Ban Ki-Moon about the creation of a regional political office that would focus specifically on the LRA?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000049"></a>While the LRA requires a targeted military strategy to apprehend its top leaders, there also needs to be increased sensitisation at ground level, allowing members of the LRA, or those who have been captured by it-whether abducted children, women sex slaves or fighters-to return home in safety and security. What further steps are Her Majesty's Government taking with the Government of the DRC and other regional Governments to develop not only military but also political and social welfare approaches? Furthermore, what steps have the British Government taken to ensure aid relief for victims, for the rescue and rehabilitation of abductees and for the reconstruction of devastated communities?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000050"></a>In conclusion, I offer two examples of the human reality behind the statistics-the reality of the brutality inflicted by the LRA on its victims. I have talked to many children who have escaped following abduction by the LRA. They have described the horrendous programmes of brutalisation and dehumanisation to which they have been subjected. One girl told me how one day at dawn she was forced to kill another child with a panga and to drink his blood. She said, "I still have nightmares when I remember that terrible dawn when I had to kill my friend, but what could I do? It was him or me". A teenage boy described the fate of his friend who had tried to escape but had been recaptured by LRA soldiers. They staked him out on the ground and the boy to whom I was talking and his friends were forced to cut their friend into pieces. The LRA had also killed the father of this teenager, after he had escaped successfully, as a punishment, so he goes around carrying the burden of guilt for the death of his father. Such unmitigated evil must be recognised and contained, not only for the political danger that it poses to the DRC and Sudan in these difficult days but to bring to justice those who have perpetrated some of the most horrendous crimes against humanity in our contemporary world.</p>
<h5><a name="10020383000099"></a>4.18 pm</h5>

It is the first time that we have had a full-scale debate on the subject since November 2008. At that time, the Government were keen to keep Parliament fully informed and proactive on what is the  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>largest and most expensive of all UN peacekeeping operations, which is expected to continue for at least another year after the expiry of the present mandate at the end of May. The Government should provide time for periodic debates on what the UK is doing to help formulate and act on an effective UN policy. I hope to hear that from the Minister today.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000052"></a>The Security Council urges the DRC Government to establish sustainable peace, effectively protect the civilian population, develop security sector institutions that fully respect the rule of law, ensure respect for human rights, put an end to impunity and put an end to the depredation caused by the armed groups. However, is Kabila capable of delivering on this programme, even with massive international help? He has not stopped his own armed forces committing massacres and gross human rights violations. None the less, as we have heard, MONUC continues to operate closely with the DRC military, except where the unit is suspected of having committed grave violations of international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. Even then, it withdraws support from units only if violations persist. Support for one unit was suspended only after it had killed at least 62, and possibly as many as 270, civilians over the six-month period immediately prior to the suspension of co-operation. Co-operation should be suspended immediately where there are allegations of serious misconduct and resumed only when the unit concerned has been fully exonerated.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000053"></a>One reason for the misconduct is the integration of the CNDP militia commanded, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, by Bosco Ntaganda. He is wanted for war crimes but was made a general in the FARDC after he made a deal with Kinshasa a year ago. Will the Minister confirm that President Kabila has been asked repeatedly to arrest Ntaganda and other alleged war criminals? What answers do we get when we raise these matters? The deal with the CNDP was not effective because the rebels kept their own independent command structures, partly on the excuse that the Government had failed to implement the 23 March agreement. The other obvious reason identified by Global Witness, as mentioned by my noble friend and others, was that by signing the agreement the CNDP gained additional access to mining sites in the Kivus, including much of the lucrative trade in cassiterite, the primary ore of tin required in the manufacture of electronic products. What has happened to the new agreement signed at Christmas under which the CNDP would dismantle its roadblocks? Is it going to hand over the areas that it controls, such as Bisie, the location of the largest cassiterite mine in eastern DRC?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000054"></a>All noble Lords have mentioned the control of mineral resources by the armed groups, which provides them with large sums of money to buy weapons and pay their soldiers, partly cancelling out the UN's $1.3 billion attempt to bring peace and security to the eastern DRC. The illicit mining and export of minerals are the engine of what the Security Council describes as,</p>
<ul><a name="10020383000090"></a>"the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation".</ul>
<p><a name="10020383000082"></a>Its response is for MONUC to support the establishment of trading counters in the Kivus, through which minerals would be traded and taxes levied on the transactions. However, the resolution contains nothing about helping

The next phase of the UN security and stabilisation support strategy is said to foresee the eventual demilitarisation and control of mining areas. Will the UK ensure that it is dealt with in the strategic review to be presented to the Security Council by 1 April?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000055"></a>The Secretary-General says that the new strategy will include completion of military operations against the LRA, a point eloquently raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. However, as she described, the LRA has killed many people in the past year. Even though it has only 100 members in the DRC, they are said to have murdered more than 1,200 people in 2009 and caused 270,000 to flee from their homes. Operations against the LRA were not successful, partly because of the indiscipline of the units involved. I wonder whether the new strategy might include an element that was dropped from the original plan to embed a MONUC company, if not in every FARDC unit, at least in the reintegrated units where the main problem arises.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000056"></a>The Secretary-General says that the LRA is now a regional threat, extending into the CAR and Sudan, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, mentioned, but this is nothing new. Mr Ban wants the mandates of the affected countries to be harmonised, but an even better solution would be a combined operation, with UN logistical support, to arrest Kony and to eliminate the group once and for all.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000057"></a>How can we reconcile the deterioration in the humanitarian situation reported by the UN with its action plan for 2010, which provides for a reduction in support of 14 per cent on the mid-year review of 2009? Is this not a reflection of the current global economic situation rather than the actual needs of the population? There is an appalling legacy of suffering from the brutalities committed last year by government and irregular forces alike, including more than 10,000 cases of sexual violence-again mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox-recorded in the Kivus alone. If access to North Kivu is improved, as the visit by Alan Doss presages, the demand for humanitarian services will increase steeply.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000058"></a>Finally, there needs to be a set of end points to which MONUC aspires as part of the April strategy revision, with target dates for their achievement. The DRC will need substantial aid until it controls and is able to tax its huge mineral wealth, which should be one of the objectives. Once it has eliminated the LRA and FDLR and completed the reintegration of the CNDP, the UN military should pack up and go.</p>

It is also the site of one of the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crises. It has been described as being in the centre of what could tragically be referred to as Africa's world war. I, too, therefore, thank the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for introducing a debate on the conflict in eastern Congo and support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on the African Great Lakes all-party group.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000060"></a>The ongoing, protracted war has claimed 3 million lives at the last estimate, either as a direct result of fighting or because of disease and malnutrition. Continued attacks against civilians are vicious and widespread. Attacks are accompanied by rape and abductions, many of the abductees being made to become sexual slaves or perform forced labour. They often die from their injuries when abused; others are shot or burned to death.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000061"></a>It has been grimly calculated that, for every rebel combatant disarmed during the operations in November 2008 against the FDLR, one civilian has been killed, seven women and girls have been raped, six houses have been burned down and destroyed, and 900 people have been forced to flee their homes. Can Her Majesty's Government say what work the UN is doing to cut off the financing of such rebel groups? Will the Minister update the Committee on the living conditions and situations of the hundreds of thousands of people internally displaced due to the conflicts? Where are they? What action is being taken to make certain that humanitarian assistance for them is being delivered and that further suffering is prevented? How are Her Majesty's Government bolstering the UN's role in Congo so that it can more effectively meet humanitarian needs, reduce the remaining violent conflicts, strengthen security through its police force and generally offer greater protection for these groups?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000062"></a>MONUC was specifically mentioned by noble Lords today. Do Her Majesty's Government believe that it is at full strength, or should it have more troops? Refugees International has said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10020383000091"></a>"MONUC is once again juggling conflicting mandated tasks while facing a critical lack of resources".</ul>
<p><a name="10020383000083"></a>Does the Minister agree?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000063"></a>Among other criticisms, it has been remarked that UN,</p>
<ul><a name="10020383000092"></a>"military operations have not succeeded in neutralizing the FDLR and have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis".</ul>
<p><a name="10020383000084"></a>In fact, FDLR rebels have been able to use vast international networks to bolster their supply of arms and recruit extra soldiers.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000064"></a>How confident are the Government in the UN's new strategy to tackle the conflict in eastern DRC, rather than continuing to provide blanket support for Congolese soldiers? What checks are being made to make certain that these efforts are not being abused? Given that this is a regional conflict, what discussions are HMG having with neighbouring countries about their role in the conflict?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000065"></a>In this very volatile region, of which eastern Congo is the heart, with Uganda on its border, a demarcation exercise is currently taking place over access to oil found in Lake Albert. Given the difficulties that oil has caused and will no doubt continue to cause in the developing world-it has been identified by Professor Paul Collier as "a natural resource curse"-what steps are the Government taking to monitor these events and to make certain that the demarcation takes place according to clear and consensual lines?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000066"></a>The situation in eastern Congo is a humanitarian catastrophe, as we know. It will deteriorate even further if the international community does not strengthen the UN's ability to act on its behalf. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="10020383000101"></a>4.31 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10020383000067"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10020383000111"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, like all noble Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey. I am very grateful to him for bringing this debate before us today and giving us an opportunity to discuss the situation in the DRC. By my calculation, 47 questions have been asked and I doubt whether I shall be able to do them justice in the 12 minutes available to me. However, I have been helped by your Lordships, who have described the human tragedy in the DRC far better than I could and, indeed, far better than my civil servants, who have drafted a speech for me.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000068"></a>My noble friend Lady Kinnock, who is in Brussels today, will be visiting the DRC before the end of the month. I shall ensure that your Lordships' concerns, and indeed suggestions, are brought to her attention, together with the letter that I shall inevitably have to write to cover a number of the questions which have been posed but which I cannot possibly answer in the time available.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000069"></a>As noble Lords have said, there has been widespread concern about the atrocities that continue to be committed not only by some rebel groups-in particular, the FDLR-but also by the Congolese armed forces during Operation Kimia II. We are clear that the situation is unacceptable. Although MONUC and the Congolese army have claimed relative success over the FDLR in the past few months, the humanitarian cost of operations in the region has been unacceptably high, as has been eloquently indicated by your Lordships. We are now moving into the phase of Operation Amani Leo. It has only a five-month mandate but will have a very tight focus: while it will put pressure on the FDLR fighters, it will also strengthen civilian protection.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000070"></a>It is important that lessons from the previous mandate and from the abuse of civilians that has taken place are learnt and that the United Nations, through MONUC, is more effective in avoiding some of the things that have gone on. My brief says that 1.5 million people are internally displaced in eastern DRC, although I think that the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said that the figure was 2.1 million. What is half a million when we are talking of such numbers? The truth is that it is a tragedy for millions of people. Although some of the armed groups are now operating on a smaller scale-the Lord's Resistance Army, for example-they continue, as has been more than adequately expressed, to commit human rights abuses.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000071"></a>We continue to support humanitarian work in the region. The DfID budget spend in the DRC was £47 million in 2009. Of this, £30 million was contributed to the humanitarian pooled fund, which is available to agencies doing aid work within the area. Here, I would rather try to answer some of the questions that have been raised in different forms by a number of noble Lords than frustrate them by giving facts and figures of which they are fully aware.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked how we reconcile the fact that we appear to be spending less money while the problem is increasing. The humanitarian action plan budget is set and reviewed mid-year. In 2009, the budget was increased by that review from $831 million to $946 million. While a slight reduction in the overall amount took place in mid-2009, the  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>humanitarian action plan budget for 2010 of $837 million is still comparable to the original figure provided at the start of 2009, which was $831 million. The important point is that that assessment is based on the needs of the DRC, assessed by the broader humanitarian community in the DRC. It is not a response that has anything to do with the downturn in the world economy; it is to do with those on the ground seeing what can most effectively be spent. As has been acknowledged by noble Lords, we remain a leading and very active contributor and donor, with some £40 million given in 2009 and £39 million already committed in 2010. We continue to monitor the situation and can respond with additional support if that is thought to be necessary.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000073"></a>The mandate of MONUC is, as has been said, short-term until the strategic review, which will be dealt with in April. That relates to the operational part of the continuing mandate of MONUC, which is already determined to be for a year from 2010. The troop ceiling remains unchanged at 21,000. That is the assessment of what is required. UN Security Council Resolution 1906, which supports this, mandates a presence for 12 months from May 2010. We hope that a new mandate will complement a period of progress in the DRC, with positive developments in security sector reform and the re-establishment and reintegration of those who will give up arms and come back into the society that we seek to restore. We do not envisage that a drawdown of troops will arise from the review. It will be an opportunity to reconfigure the resources, based on the judgment of the special rapporteur, Alan Doss, on the most effective way of using those resources.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000074"></a>As this is the first debate on this issue since 2008, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether we could have such debates periodically. I have not learnt many lessons while I have been in this House, but what I have learnt is that you do not make commitments for debates in the House. That is a matter for the usual channels. There are other opportunities, as have been taken on this occasion, for members of the Opposition to initiate debates, through the Thursday balloted debates and QSDs. However, I will take the request and report it faithfully to the Chief Whip.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also raised the question of the ability of the Kabila Government to deliver on the Security Council's demand to protect civilian populations. Other noble Lords made the point that the state institutions of the DRC do not provide for the strong government that is an essential component for that country to gain for its citizens the kind of freedoms, humanitarian support and lives that they deserve. We are supporting the development of the DRC state institutions. The international community has been focusing on that for some time. We are actively pursuing security sector reform to make sure that those institutions comply with human rights norms. The Government of the DRC have also launched their own initiative to tackle impunity, which, as several noble Lords said, remains an issue.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000076"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that there need to be realistic and achievable benchmarks-some way of measuring the way forward. That is what  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we want to see from MONUC, the international community and our own DfID and Foreign Office commitments.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000077"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, talked about resources and, in particular, helicopters. The contribution that the UK makes to the UN peacekeeping operation will be in the region of $100 million this year. While we have no plans to provide helicopters bilaterally, we understand from MONUC that three troop-contributing countries, of which there are 57 in total, will explore the possibility of providing additional cover.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000078"></a>The noble Lord also raised the question of joint civilian and military operating teams. Again, we think that this is a very important way forward. We agree with all those who have said that there cannot simply be a military solution to the problems of the DRC. It will require a military and political solution. He also asked whether there should be a civilian protection expert group to inquire into and report on the needs. The recent UN system-wide strategy for the protection of civilians in the DRC has been developed by the Protection Cluster and MONUC. The aim of that strategy is to consolidate the protection of civilians, report on responses and improve the current actions to be in line with international human rights and international humanitarian law. This work is a response to the MONUC mandate's requirements to report on this. I believe that there is a greater focus and concern, which is certainly reflected in the Security Council resolution.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000079"></a>MONUC has always been committed to tackling indiscipline and human rights abuses within the Congolese army and will continue to withdraw support from units implicated in the carrying out of atrocities. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made criticisms that the action was not moving quickly enough and that there had to be atrocities before you could prevent atrocities-if that is not too unkind an interpretation. The Security Council resolution states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10020383000089"></a>"MONUC military leadership shall confirm, prior to providing any support to such operations that sufficient joint planning has been undertaken, especially regarding the protection of the civilian population".</p>

<p><a name="10020383000085"></a>It,</p>
<ul><a name="10020383000093"></a>"calls upon MONUC to intercede with the FARDC ... if elements of a FARDC unit receiving MONUC's support are suspected of having committed grave violations of such laws, and if the situation persists, calls upon MONUC to withdraw support".</ul>
<p><a name="10020383000086"></a>In practical terms, that means that the support that we are providing is in the form of food, fuel and transport. We will not withdraw humanitarian support in those circumstances. MONUC is working closely with the Congolese army to investigate the human rights abuses of each brigade that MONUC is supporting.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000080"></a>Several noble Lords raised the question of impunity in relation to Congolese army personnel, some integrated and some in the militias. Bosco Ntaganda was mentioned. Our ambassador has discussed with the UN Secretary-General's special representative Alan Doss the arrest warrant required and has received assurances that the UN mission will support the DRC Government in carrying out the warrant. The Government of the DRC have accepted the indictment and are committed to arresting Bosco, but they are concerned to ensure that the timing of this does not derail the fragile  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process of integrating CNDP forces into the FARDC, the Congolese army. We continue to press for Bosco to be handed over to the ICC. In answer to the question whether we recognise the requirement for a special court, we fully support the investigations of the ICC and continue to press the Government of the DRC to hand over Bosco Ntaganda to ICC investigators. We agree that prosecution of human rights abusers and an end to impunity are essential steps in tackling human rights abuses.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10020383000081"></a>I am running into the point when my time is up, although I have probably dealt with only seven of the 47 questions that I have been asked. A voluminous document answering all the remaining questions will be winging its way to all noble Lords who have participated. I repeat my assurance that I shall bring the debate and its contents, suggestions and criticisms to the attention of my noble friend Lady Kinnock before she visits the DRC towards the end of the month.</p>

This debate was initiated by the persuasion and at the insistence of the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, to whom I am grateful. I have always been rather reticent about raising this topic as a subject for debate, simply because it seemed like special pleading from someone who has spent her life in old-age mental health services, but this is a timely point to have this debate-particularly this week, because of the appointment of the new national tsar for dementia, Professor Alistair Burns. He is a canny, delightful and exceptionally talented man and I know that he will go at it with aplomb, if I may say that. Let us face it, he will have a bit of an uphill struggle, given the National Audit Office's recent interim report on the capacity of the Government, the National Health Service and local authorities to implement the national dementia strategy. However, I am sure that he will get a great deal of support from parliamentarians in his new role.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000002"></a>Before I get into my "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" mode, I want to remind everyone how terrible things used to be. Before the 1960s, there were no separate services for older people with mental health problems, which meant that older people with profound mental illnesses stayed in acute hospitals, often for a long time, and just withered away at the end of the ward. They ended up either in Part III homes with the local authority, struggling to cope, or they went to a long-stay asylum or geriatric hospital, depending on whether their modus vivendi was largely horizontal or vertical. It was as simple as that; it was pretty awful.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000003"></a>In the 1960s, a few pioneers started to develop services. It was a marvellous time to be sent to one of the specialist units for training, as I was. It was an exciting time, because we felt that we were in the vanguard of a developing specialty and that we were showing our fusty old colleagues in general mental health services how community mental health services should be working in conjunction with the local authority. It was tremendous fun and very exciting.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000004"></a>I fear that, as much needed funding has gone into general mental health services, services for older people have lagged behind. We used to be more advanced in the UK than anywhere else in the world. I used to travel all over the world talking about our wonderful services. People were amazed at how far we had been able to come. I am ashamed to say that, nowadays, the situation is better in many other countries. That is a real cause for concern.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000005"></a>Let us come to the shocking statistics, so clearly set down in the Royal College of Psychiatrists' position statement published last year, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, asked a Question in the House. There is no doubt that many tens of thousands of people over the age of 65 are missing out on specialist services simply because of the way in which we configure them. This is a tragedy, as many of them risk serious deterioration and will die early as a result of a lack of treatment.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000006"></a>That is in spite of the fact that mental health problems are common in older people. Depression is the commonest disorder in old age. Its prevalence in women tends to stay the same after middle age, but in men it goes up and up. Of course, dementia is almost entirely a disorder of the very aged. Psychosis, which many of us associate with a young onset, is 50 per cent commoner in older people. Suicide is twice as common in people over 65 as it is in people under 25 and we know that at least 80 per cent of people who commit suicide are suffering from depression. However, half of young people with a major depressive illness are referred to a specialist psychiatrist, whereas only one in six older people is so referred. As treatment, by and large, has as great an efficacy among older people as among younger people, and as maintenance treatment can prevent relapse and decrease mortality, this favouring of younger adults makes no clinical sense.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000007"></a>In the past 30 years or so, services have been configured by age. A strict demarcation line was perceived as the only way to carve out the finances necessary to establish a new service. It makes clinical sense, of course, because of the special characteristics of the disorders, which tend to co-exist with physical health problems and are more likely to have an obvious organic medical origin. Also, pharmaceutical treatments are far trickier for them.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000008"></a>I was one of those who supported this age discrimination. I used to tell my colleagues, "Don't you dare treat anyone over 65", because I could then say that the proportion of the budget that went to older people was mine and that all the resources that went to this group of people belonged to my service. It was quite a convincing strategy for getting fair shares. That is how it started.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000009"></a>However, this model has been interpreted far too rigidly. Now we have the tragedy that someone aged  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>64 can access a wide range of support services through adult mental health services, but only one year later, regardless of their need, they will be placed in an old-age service where the same support is not available. If you are under 65 and you have a mental health crisis or attempt suicide, you can have an immediate assessment, treatment at home and a 24-hour specialist team. Over the age of 65, you are barely eligible for anything; you are put on an out-patient waiting list. Over-65s are usually denied access to psychological therapies, early intervention, rehabilitation and addiction services, which nearly all have a strict age cut-off.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000010"></a>The recent imbalance has happened by default. In 1999, the establishment of the National Service Framework for Mental Health saw the beginning of much needed investment in mental health services and the creation of new specialist teams. Two years on, the National Service Framework for Older People had one small section only on this. The difference was that the NSF for mental health came with money and performance management directly from the Department of Health, whereas mental health services for older people came with no money and no performance management from the centre. Clearly, not only have these services been excluded from investment and developments but the increasing numbers of older people have not been matched by extra resource. A report commissioned by the department in 2006 confirmed the failure to make progress.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000011"></a>I and many others have pointed out the inequity of this, but it has taken 10 years to acknowledge that permanent leadership in the department is crucial for at least one important disorder. However, the leadership vacuum in other mental health services remains unresolved. It has been calculated that it would take an extra £2 billion to £4 billion to even up access. This is not going to happen-I am not asking for it-but it points to a deep cultural shift in commissioning towards equality of opportunity for older people, which will mean shifting the resources away from other areas, probably within mental health. What are the Government doing to respond to some of those critical reports that have pointed out the shortfall?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000012"></a>Our ageing population is the biggest challenge, but I am still not convinced that we have leadership within government to tackle it. As part of their ageing strategy, the Government have created the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing, which has ministerial leadership from the DWP and the Social Care Minister. It does not refer anywhere on its website to health. Who will be responsible for driving the equality that we need?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000013"></a>I am hopeful that, if the sections of the Equality Bill related to ageing are enacted, a few test cases will help no end, because exhortation never has. There are many issues that I could raise today, but I point to the need for fair access to and distribution of resources, because what needs to be done is fairly obvious. I ask when it really will be done.</p>

Although I agree that much progress has been made, which we all applaud, I shall concentrate on the difference in the way in which older people and younger people are treated, specifically in mental health, although of course there are younger people in exactly the same situation.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000015"></a>It is estimated that, for every 10,000 people over 65, 2,500-or 25 per cent-have a diagnosable mental illness, 500 of whom will have dementia. That figure is taken from the position statement of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, quoted.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000016"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned depression. We know that, on an average day in a 500-bed district general hospital, 330 beds will be occupied by older people, 220 of whom will have a mental disorder. We also know that depression is the most common health problem in later life, affecting 15 per cent of older people. However, 85 per cent of older people with depression receive no help from the NHS, which is blatant discrimination. It cannot be excused, however much progress we make. Depression is the cause of 80 per cent of suicides. It doubles natural mortality and it is the major reason for admission to care homes. Those figures again come from the Royal College of Psychiatrists' position statement of last October.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000017"></a>We know that, if you are under 65 and have a mental health crisis, you will almost certainly receive immediate assessment and treatment at home from a 24-hour specialist team. I have personal experience of this from the past few months. I saw a crisis team go to everybody who was younger before arriving at nine o'clock at night-having been called at 7.30 in the morning-to see an elderly person who was in a very bad state. An immediate move is made to the younger person, not to the older person.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000018"></a>If you are under 65 and have been admitted to a general hospital, you will probably receive an assessment of your mental health, but if you are over 65, you most likely will not. However, if you have a mental health problem, you are more likely to stay in hospital for twice as long or be discharged to a care home instead of to your own home-again, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has made that clear.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000019"></a>I turn to an issue very close to my heart-dementia. Yesterday, the Alzheimer's Research Trust produced a report that demonstrated that one person in five over 80 is affected by dementia and that every patient costs the UK economy more than £27,000 a year. That makes £23 billion a year overall. However, in the UK, for every £10 spent on research into health and social care, the princely sum of 5p is spent on dementia. Although dementia accounts for over 50 per cent of the combined health and social care costs of cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia, it receives 6 per cent of research funding. A survey of several thousand people with dementia found that almost 50 per cent of carers said that being in hospital had a very negative effect on the person with the condition. The average length of stay, which is about a week, more than doubles for people with dementia.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000020"></a>I am delighted that the Government recently held a research summit on dementia, which I was privileged to chair. A ministerial advisory group has now also been set up. We just hope that, regardless of who wins  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the general election, there will be a political consensus about the importance of dementia. We hope that all the parties will make sure that, whatever happens, this work continues. I hope that the spokespeople from all parties will make that clear.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000021"></a>There is blatant ageism in accessing mental health services. The Healthcare Commission's report <I>Equality in Later Life</I>, which examined six mental health trusts, found that older people were excluded from mental health services received by young people, that there were very low levels of referrals from GPs to specialist units for mental health sufferers who are older and that there was a lack of age-appropriateness throughout. Two out of the six trusts have made a lot of progress towards eliminating ageism but they have taken very different paths in terms of structure. A common feature was the role of clinical and managerial leaders in bringing about change. A lot can be done.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000022"></a>The same report demonstrated that many mental health providers have organised their services into working-age and older adult services, which is reinforced by policy divisions between the mental health and older people national service frameworks. Reaching the age of 65 does not mean that you change very much, but suddenly your services are completely different. In my view, that is very difficult to understand, let alone accept. The unintended effect is definitely a disparity between older and working-age adults. Surely the goal must be that services are based on need, not age, as was made clear by the report to the Secretary of State by Sir Ian Carruthers and Jan Ormondroyd in October this year.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000023"></a>We must aim to achieve age equality partly by taking up the recommendation in the Royal College of Psychiatrists' position statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203103000036"></a>"All professional regulatory organisations will need to review and, if necessary, revise their standards",</p>

<p><a name="100203103000033"></a>and codes of conduct. The statement recommends:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203103000037"></a>"Comprehensive specialist mental health services for older people must be reconfigured and developed, with an urgent need to provide: access to crisis home treatment ... early diagnosis and intervention ... care home liaison ... general hospital liaison",</p>

<p><a name="100203103000034"></a>and, as my noble friend Lady Murphy emphasised,</p>
<ul><a name="100203103000038"></a>"access to psychological therapies".</ul>
<p><a name="100203103000035"></a>Surely the biggest discrimination of all in dementia is that a terminal illness experienced mostly by older people is generally treated as being eligible only for social care funding, rather than NHS care. Why is that? Nothing in the proposed national care plan or the Personal Care at Home Bill will radically alter that, so far as I can see, but we must be fair. An Equality Bill is going through the House, intended to achieve fairness in our society. We need the same fairness, whatever our age.</p>

It is rather humbling to be part of this group from your Lordships' House who are discussing this, because it seems to me to be a group that understands these issues profoundly. I suspect that many of your Lordships, like me, have personal experience of family members who have experienced these problems. People are bringing a great deal of experience to this debate.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000025"></a>I wanted to pick up some points that perhaps go a little wider: how health services are delivered, why we have this problem and what I think those with the political and policy power can do to move it on. I shall make two big general points, which are pretty obvious, and then pick up three more specific points.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000026"></a>The two big general points lie behind what has been said but have perhaps not been spelt out quite like this. The first issue-this is not a personal point-is that this is our future; this is what it will increasingly be about in future. We suspect that there will be more older people with mental illness and co-morbidities. That is another big issue, but those co-morbidities can be lost in people's view of older people with mental health problems. It is our future. It is a growing issue because it will cost us more, whether we plan for it or not-the reality of care will be there.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000027"></a>The second issue is also big and obvious: this will grow in political sensitivity. That is partly because we are all ageing and partly because we now have more relatives in their 80s. As the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, said, we need only to consider the average age in hospital. In my experience in the NHS, when the average age in the entire hospital went above 72, we were in real trouble. That context is fundamental to the future of health services in the country.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000028"></a>Let me pick up the three specifics. First, there are some treatments that work, which people do not always realise, and there is a research agenda, which I know that the Government have recently promoted, to find more treatments. That is vital, because there is sometimes a sense of hopelessness when one thinks about the subject as a member of the general public. That research is not just about drugs; it is also about understanding how we deliver services. As the Nuffield Trust brought out very well in its recent study on dementia, that is about understanding the nature of dementia and what it is like from the point of view of the person with dementia. A great body of understanding and research still needs to be developed and given higher priority if ageism and other problems are to be tackled.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000029"></a>The other specifics are what my noble friend Lady Murphy referred to as the cultural shift: how do you make change and what are the barriers? I agree that part of it is a leadership issue. It is great to see that a new tsar has been appointed and good to hear the noble Baroness's comments about the original national service frameworks coming with money. So there is a leadership issue, but there are other issues as well. The first is, simply, that we still have a health service that is just not configured for patients with these sorts of needs. They are similar to a lot of other patients with continuing care needs, but we still have a health system that is based around hospitals and doctors and has funding and payment mechanisms that reinforce the notion that health is about GP referral to hospital, treatment in hospital and going home. There is a fundamental barrier to paying for good mental health services. Incidentally, this is not an argument against payment by results-for a whole range of areas, payment by results seems to me to work very well-this is an argument for finding some other way to pay for another range of services. That is a fundamental cultural problem about health, not just in the UK but in all developed countries.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000030"></a>The second point, which came out in what my noble friend Lady Greengross said, is that this is also about people. It is not just about telling the Government and the policy-makers that they should pay more attention to this; it is about staff and how people think. We have all seen elderly patients who have come into hospital with a stroke. You know that they should have had a scan as soon as possible, but they may be there for 48 hours before something happens. Some of that is benign neglect, if I may put it like that. It is not necessarily about money-sometimes it may be misplaced kindness in not intervening-but it happens all the time.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000031"></a>The third point, which I stress strongly, is that if the Government-the policy-makers-are going to move this up the agenda, it is not just about more money or more leadership but about staff training. I mean staff training within the specific service but even more within the acute hospital. It is certainly true that 5 per cent of our patients spend 65 per cent of the money and that most of those patients have continuing care needs. One wonders whether 65 per cent of medical education is devoted to people with continuing care issues. I suspect that it is not; I see my noble friend nodding at me.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100203103000032"></a>These are big changes. My contribution to this debate is to say that this is real and it is going to get bigger. The political salience will grow. We will be confronted by this more and more. The efforts to solve it are about supporting what the Government have started with their research programme and developing it further; taking further the attempts to change the model of care and service in the NHS more generally so that it accommodates the needs of an increasing number of older people; and pushing forward with the professional bodies and trainers to make some changes in the way that we all, I guess, behave when we work in these services.</p>

<p><a name="100203109000001"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100203109000027"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lady Murphy. That will not be a surprise to many people. As someone who has worked in the mental health services for the best part of a quarter of a century, I feel very conscious of the plight of older people with mental health problems.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000002"></a>Until the national service framework in 1999 introduced a plethora of community services for the working-age mentally ill population, the plight of older people today was shared by anybody with a mental health problem. What has changed is that the younger age group has finally received some services. Since 1999 there have been enormous strides in meeting the needs of people aged 18 to 64. Most particularly, as others have mentioned, multidisciplinary crisis teams go into people's homes when they face a severe mental health problem. I emphasise that these teams go into people's homes maybe three times a day in the early stages, supporting those people, monitoring the effectiveness of medication and making sure that they can manage in their own homes. It is these crisis teams, perhaps more than anything else-there are of course other teams, as my noble friend Lady Murphy mentioned-that have had a major impact in reducing the flow of people into in-patient beds.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000003"></a>If one is to be brutally honest, the savings to the economy from this reduction in mental health in-patient beds has been very significant. It is very much the success of the national service framework combined with the failure of government to provide the funding and performance management system for the National Service Framework for Older People that has created the gap in services and generated the age discrimination. In speaking in this debate, I applaud the Government for the incredible success of the national service framework over the last 10 years. We should not forget that in this debate.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000004"></a>A national survey in 2006 showed that only 8.8 per cent of mental health providers had a crisis team service specifically for people over 65. Others, such as the trust that I chair in east London, I am sad to say, in theory extend the crisis service to people over 65. I was talking to my medical director and found that, in practice, what happens is that these crisis services will carry out an assessment in the middle of the night if somebody over 65 is referred to them but will not prepare a package of home treatment care for the person over 65. The same applies to assertive outreach teams. We do not say, "People over 65 can't go to an assertive outreach service". It is open to people over 65, in theory. The fact is, though, that the assertive outreach team is overwhelmed with people aged 18 to 64, so it will not take on someone of 65-plus, so people in that age range are simply not referred. The problem is that these teams have not been funded to deal with the whole community and the decision has been made to squeeze out the elderly.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100203-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000005"></a>In addition to all this, older people have had very little access to psychological therapies. The improving access to psychological therapies programme, which is now being rolled out across the country, is age-neutral-again, in theory. However, in primary care I understand that older people suffering with depression or anxiety, disorders that are very susceptible and respond well to NICE guidance-recommended psychological treatments, will not be referred to those services. One reason for that, according to the guru on this subject, David Clark, is that therapists need specialist training in order to apply those treatments to older age groups. So far, there has been no provision of specialist training for people with IAPT to enable them to provide the services to older people.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000006"></a>I understand the Government's commitment to the IAPT provision as a route back into employment. My worry is that that commitment, which any incoming Government, of whatever colour, would no doubt replicate, would inevitably lead to IAPT following the other services in precluding older people from access in practice. In theory they have access, but I do not believe that they will in practice unless something specific is done.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000007"></a>The question then is: can we afford to continue ignoring this problem? The evidence suggests that we cannot. I pay tribute to the excellent report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, <I>The Need to Tackle Age Discrimination in Mental Health</I>, which I will draw on quite heavily in giving noble Lords a few figures; others have quoted different figures, but there may be a tiny bit of overlap.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000008"></a>First, there is the size of the problem. In the UK, 40 per cent of older people attending their GP have mental health problems. Fifty per cent of older patients in general hospitals have mental health problems-I have to say that I did not know that figure, which is colossal and terrifying-as do 60 per cent of people in care homes, which is slightly less extraordinary. The whole set of figures is just amazing. The situation is only going to become worse. The number of people over the age of 75 with depression will increase by 30 per cent and of those over 85 by 80 per cent by 2026. Depression in later life is strongly linked, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, to physical ill health and disability.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000009"></a>I am sure that the rationale behind limiting the national service framework to working-age people was purely economic: as these people are not contributing to the economy, the urgency of treating them is less, so let us leave them out. You can sort of understand that. However, even on economic grounds, the case now for addressing the needs of the elderly is irrefutable. Delivering older people's mental health services to care homes not only improves the quality of life for the individual but reduces the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs, the use of GP time and days spent in hospital. Someone needs to work out those figures-in fact I am sure that someone has, but I do not have them before me-but there must be considerable savings in that area alone.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000010"></a>The provision of older people's psychiatric hospital liaison services could achieve considerable savings through reducing the length of hospital stays and reducing readmission rates. Despite the fact that these liaison services are recommended by the Department of Health, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, only 27 per cent of trusts provide even the most basic of these liaison services. I believe that only with a very clear commitment from the Department of Health and a requirement on PCTs to fund those services will they be provided, albeit that the economic arguments are very strong. If PCTs were a bit more sophisticated, surely they would provide those services.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000011"></a>According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, preliminary evidence suggests that crisis home treatment teams for older people reduce hospital admission rates by up to 31 per cent. They also reduce the length of hospital stay, unplanned admissions and admission to care homes. The potential savings must be colossal. The New Horizons strategy, which replaced the national service framework in 2009, provides a good framework to start reversing the age discrimination. It makes it clear that provision needs to be made to enable groups that have lagged behind to catch up.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000012"></a>I will jump to the end. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee an assurance that research funding in this field will be given priority and that the Department of Health will ensure that rational decisions are made by PCTs to invest in mental health services to cut the huge waste of resources in placing people with mental health problems in acute hospitals when they can be far better cared for at home.</p>

Despite her compliment to me-it was a bit of a plot that we cooked up in the wake of the launch of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' report-it seemed to me that this issue requires cross-party thinking. It is wonderful, with her expertise and lifelong working experience in the field, that she should lead the debate. I am really grateful to her for doing so.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000014"></a>We have heard a lot about the statistics in the Royal College of Psychiatrists' report, but this is an issue that we as a House address all too rarely. The report pointed out the worrying statistics about which we have already heard. We all know that the National Service Framework for Mental Health was for working-age adults only. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, that the Government have made huge strides-we as a society have made huge strides-in the treatment of mental illness of people of working age, but that has led to what seems to be an extraordinary discrimination against older people. The National Service Framework for Older People deals only with dementia and depression, not with other conditions that are common among older people, including psychosis, which people think belongs to young men but is common among older people, and delirium, which is very common.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000015"></a>Over the past decade, partly as a result of the national service framework and partly, as the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said, because of the way in which we commission services, things have actually got worse. Everyone knows that they have got worse. The Department of Health has commissioned two reports and has considered what would be needed if we were to make older people's access to services equal to that of younger adults. The sum involved is vast-something like £2 billion to £4 billion, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned. That seems to be especially evident around the area of depression and anxiety disorders. This is information that the department itself has brought into the public domain.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000016"></a>We are an ageing society. One could argue that the Equality Bill, which we are debating at the moment, should help, but we need to be very clear about the statistics, which others have mentioned, on the prevalence of mental illness among people aged over 64 in the UK. As I am about to hit 60, I am getting a bit concerned. This will affect quite a lot of us quite soon. We know that the incidence of mental disorder among people aged over 64 in the UK is between 20 and 25 per cent and that dementia comprises between 20 and 25 per cent of that. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, cited the extraordinary figure that, for older people, there are mental health problems among 40 per cent of people who go to their GP and 50 per cent of those who are in hospital. I agree that the figure of 60 per cent in care homes seems a mere bagatelle by comparison. The King's Fund showed that, by 2026, the only increase in the number of people with mental disorder will be by virtue of ageing, which is why this is such an enormously important cultural issue.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000020"></a>We have already heard that there is a huge incidence of depression among people over 75, that it is likely to increase by 30 per cent by 2026-by 80 per cent among people over 85-and that it is three times more common than dementia, especially among people who are living alone and in isolated circumstances. We know that it is a major risk factor for suicide, we know that it increases natural mortality by a factor of two to three and we know that it impairs independent function. It also worsens the outcomes of other medical conditions and it costs a lot. The consequences are therefore serious. What it really says is that society does not care much. This kind of discrimination reflects cultural attitudes on the value of older people versus the value of younger people. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, is right: we need to take this seriously. I could say much more about this.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000021"></a>I wish to draw two other issues to the Committee's attention. In the national audit of violence, there were far higher rates found in wards for older people than among younger people. Also, the sudden unexplained deaths in patients were highest among those aged 65 to 74, particularly where dementia was involved. That is eight times higher than among those aged 45 or less. That suggests, again, that something odd is going on. We cannot track it exactly, but it looks peculiar. This must be cultural. It is a form of discrimination; the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is right about that. Older people are seen as making less fuss and as being less likely to cause a row. That is why we need to take this seriously in a cross-party way.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100203109000022"></a>I would like to ask the Minister five questions. First, as there is already discrimination against older people in mental health services, will funding for older people be protected against any forthcoming financial constraints, or will older people be penalised equally with younger people, which would compound discrimination? Secondly, will lack of funding be used as a justification for not addressing age discrimination in mental health services? Thirdly, can she confirm that there will be investment in specialist services for older people to match demographic change, or will discrimination be allowed to escalate by increasing demand exceeding lack of supply? Fourthly, can she confirm that legislation will protect the need for age-appropriate specialist mental health services-the need, for example, for specialist training and provision for CBT-or will this have to be an exception in a law to ban age discrimination? Finally, because depression is

<h5><a name="100203117000203"></a>5.37 pm</h5>

<p><a name="100203117000001"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100203117000242"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, it is with particular feeling that I express my gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, for tabling this Question, to which she spoke, as ever, so compellingly. I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for the conspiracy that she entered into with the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000002"></a>I was shocked when I looked at this subject closely. We owe it to the Royal College of Psychiatrists and to the former Healthcare Commission for publishing the evidence of what is little short of a national disgrace. In using that phrase I am not necessarily pointing the finger at the Government, for reasons that I shall explain in a minute, but, nevertheless, I am sure that the Minister will agree that the systemic failings highlighted in the debate cannot now be ignored. They require action both at the centre and at every level of the health service. Her reply today will be listened to and noted with more than usual attention.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000003"></a>I am the first to say that mental health services in general are a lot better than they were a few years ago thanks to the investment that has been made in them. However, it is sadly all too clear-the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, gave some statistics-that those services are not available to nearly the same extent for older people. I am not going to repeat the statistics; we all have as our bible the compendium of evidence assembled by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which will be our point of reference for the foreseeable future.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000004"></a>The evidence assembled by Age Concern should also pull us up short. While I shall not repeat some of its figures, a few have not been mentioned today. They are figures that fall on the other side of the equation-what all this is costing us as a country. According to Age Concern, if we do not satisfactorily meet the mental health needs of older people over the next few years, the UK economy will suffer to the tune of £245 billion per year in lost consumers, £230 billion in lost workers, £15 billion from the absence of lost carers, and so on. Therefore, there is an imperative of a purely economic kind, never mind the one that we first think of-the cost in human terms.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000005"></a>If as an elderly person you are seriously mentally ill and you find yourself in hospital, your prognosis is particularly poor. You are likely to stay in hospital longer. You are more likely to lose independent function. You are more likely to die. To my mind, admitting an elderly person to hospital because of their mental state is to admit that the system outside has failed them. What is going wrong? The royal college points to several things. One is the arbitrary cut-off at age 65 between adult mental health services and health services for older people. That cut-off, to which other speakers have referred, is less the result of deliberate action on anyone's part than an unlooked-for consequence of the way in which services have been configured to conform to, on the one hand, the National Service Framework for Mental Health and, on the other, the National Service Framework for Older People. The  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>age cut-off is of course lacking in any clinical significance, but it is also wrong in principle, because, as we so often say in this House, people of all ages have a right to expect that they will be treated under the NHS on the basis of need, not by reference to how old they are.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000006"></a>The other main factor underlying this picture relates to professional training-the lack of training combined with misplaced cultural attitudes towards the elderly. The problem that the noble Baroness highlighted cannot be solved overnight or by passing an Act of Parliament. It is quite clear that the needs of older people are too often not properly understood at primary care and community level and, because of that, they are not being correctly addressed.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000007"></a>Older people's mental health needs are different from those of the young, which is why we have to think about how to meet those needs in a way that also looks at the older person's total circumstances, including their physical illnesses. I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, mentioned co-morbidities. It is not enough just to identify depression in an older person and then treat it. We need to look at the causes. Very often older people feel isolated and lonely. There can be all sorts of reasons for that. Someone who is incontinent may be afraid to go out. Someone whose toenails need cutting may find it painful to walk. Someone whose eyesight is poor may not be able to manage in the street. Yes, we need specialist mental health services for the elderly, but this is also about holistic care of the elderly in the community, and the services required to deliver that are often neither complex nor particularly expensive.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000008"></a>We rightly hear a lot in the news about the increasing incidence of dementia, but the World Health Organisation is warning that, in 10 years' time, depression will be the second highest health burden that we have to deal with. The number of people who live alone is steadily increasing and the availability of informal care is shrinking. Although we talk about wanting to keep elderly people in their own homes for as long as possible, we have to remember that a care home can provide an older person with company and stimulation. Delivering primary care services direct to care homes, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, was right to tell us, is also very cost-effective in terms of patient outcomes and the use of professional time. However, with rising numbers we must invest in people. The way ahead lies in having clinical teams with the right skill sets, which are capable of providing age-appropriate services, including mental health services in the community. Age-appropriateness is important.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000009"></a>There are examples of good practice and there are some good government initiatives, including New Horizons and the national dementia strategy, but if there is one message that we need to take from this debate it is surely that time is now of the essence.</p>

I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, for giving us the opportunity to debate an issue that is of such

I am grateful to other noble Lords for their contributions, which, as usual, were very well informed. I pay tribute to the Cross Benches yet again.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000011"></a>Unfair discrimination of any description, including by age, is unacceptable. It is alien to the principles that sustain our National Health Service and it is vital that we do everything that we can to eradicate it, not just in health but across every part of public services. It is unfortunately the case that many older people live with mental health problems. There is also, as many noble Lords have said-the Government agree with this-strong evidence that older people experience discrimination at all levels of mental health care, as described eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. The 10-year National Service Framework for Mental Health, which ended last year, covered only adults of working age. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, that it was directed at working-age adults not because of economic need; it was, more likely, because of the kind of issues that were outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, in her introductory remarks about addressing the needs of the elderly. Mental health for older people was confined to the National Service Framework for Older People, which has indeed added to the widening of age discrimination.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000012"></a>I will start by talking about the Equality Bill; I am working on it at the moment, so it is high in my mind. Many of the points that were made left me thinking that the Equality Bill will help. The Equality Bill and the age equality review are important milestones in the Government's long-standing commitment to anti-discrimination. The Bill will give real bite to much of the work that is already under way. It will sharpen minds across the NHS and social services when the age discrimination ban comes into force in 2012. The Bill is not the beginning but the continuation and embodiment of our efforts. We can credibly talk about ending unfair age discrimination, although there is plenty to do.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned test cases. She may well be right, but the contemplation of test cases might do much to change the culture. The recommendations set out in the review of age discrimination in the health and social care sectors by Sir Ian Carruthers and Jan Ormondroyd are sensible pointers to what we need to do next to create services that fully meet older people's needs.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000014"></a>In December 2009, we launched <I>New Horizons: A Shared Vision for Mental Health</I>, our comprehensive programme for improving the mental health and well-being of the whole population and the services for those with poor mental health. It takes a lifespan approach, from laying down the foundations of good mental health in childhood, through promoting and protecting continued well-being into adulthood, to supporting and maintaining resilience in older age. New Horizons comes on top of significant, real-terms investment in mental health services. Since 2001-02, spending has grown by £2 billion, or by 50 per cent in real terms. This means a two-thirds growth in the number of psychiatrists, a fifth more psychiatric nurses and over 700 new teams providing specialist mental health services in the community.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000015"></a>New Horizons is about making the most of the fruits of almost a decade of investment. It is about focusing on prevention, early intervention and innovating and collaborating for the best possible results. I take on board the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, about reconfiguring the NHS with regard to this issue.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000016"></a>We are committed to ensuring that mental health services move away from the traditional explicit discrimination between adults and older adults. In 2009, the Healthcare Commission reviewed six mental health trusts. It found that two were delivering services based on need, not age, but that the other four still had to address the issue. The two trusts had approached the issue differently but both had required strong clinical and managerial leadership to be successful. Again, to echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, this is about leadership. The need for specialist older people's services should be recognised, but with access based on need, not date of birth.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000017"></a>We are working with the Royal College of Psychiatrists to develop an appropriate toolkit for mental health services and to assist it in developing age-appropriate, non-discriminatory services. As a first step, New Horizons provides the descriptors of such services to assist in this work. The providers of these services will be able to assess themselves against the toolkit to ensure that they are meeting the mental health needs of older people in their communities.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000018"></a>We are also working with the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Psychological Society to develop training initiatives to improve the rate of identification and the treatment of depression in older people both in the community and in residential care-again echoing the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp. Psychological therapies are available to adults of all ages who experience depression or anxiety disorders. Age should not form any barrier to access to those services and we expect positive outcomes for individuals who may approach those services.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000019"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Greengross and Lady Murphy, referred to the need for specialist services for older people. We absolutely agree. New Horizons supports equal access to services. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, talked about the characteristics of services for older people. I shall need to write to him with more detail about what New Horizons says about that, but he may well be familiar with that.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000020"></a>This Government have a track record of working with the NHS and I take on board the need to change the culture in this area. The first national dementia strategy, launched in February last year, is driving real change in the quality and scope of services for people affected by dementia. We very much welcome Alistair Burns, who has been mentioned, as the new national clinical director for dementia to lead this work. We are also doing vital work across social care, including through the Putting People First programme, which is slowly changing the one-size-fits-all culture of services to embrace a more personalised approach.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000021"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, asked about exceptions relating to mental health in legislation. We are determined to end age discrimination in the provision  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of these services and our policy on this remains the same. We are examining in more detail the best way to achieve this. We are open-minded at this stage on whether there should be such exceptions, but we recognise that they may well be needed.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000022"></a>Unfair age discrimination, like any form of discrimination, is unacceptable. It is unacceptable in society, in particular within publicly funded institutions such as the NHS and within social care. There is still a way to go but I think that this debate will help in putting on the record the fact that the Government agree with most of the remarks today. We recognise that there is a problem with discrimination and we want to support services to place the principles of anti-discrimination and equalities at the centre of everything that they do, particularly with regard to this issue.</p>

I may not reach the same audience as Sir Terry, but we seem to have pulled in quite a lot of people today. Using humour to cope with huge sadness, anger and despair is a rare gift. The theme of that Dimbleby lecture was shaking hands with death and coming to terms with it in the individual's own way. As Sir Terry said, "My life, my death, my choice".</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000025"></a>As death is a personal matter, I do not expect the Government to get involved in telling people how to conduct their affairs when they are dying-quite the reverse. I expect the Government to recognise that we now have a confused legal situation around death and dying that is very threatening to a growing number of people. They have a responsibility to try to facilitate some resolution of the confusion. A responsible Government-this one or another-should not wash their hands of these difficult issues and simply say that it is up to Parliament to sort things out, especially when Parliament has demonstrated that it cannot do that unaided. The theme of my remarks today is why the Government need to bring in some wise and independent help to break the parliamentary gridlock.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000026"></a>Why do we need an independent inquiry or review? First, we have a mounting set of contradictions that produce far too much confusion for many citizens. Most people want to die in their own home with their family around them, and at a time of their choosing. Instead, 60 per cent of people still die in hospital. A growing number of very determined and reasonably well off British people slip over to Switzerland to die at a time and in circumstances of their choosing. More than 700 brave souls have registered with Dignitas to keep their options open. A few have managed to persuade doctors to help them on their way illegally-probably in less than 1 per cent of deaths. Some people just give up and effectively starve themselves to death, sometimes rather painfully, but we do not know how many of those there are.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000027"></a>We have legislation that gives us the right to make living wills to stop doctors treating us, but we have little confidence that healthcare staff will always respect our wishes. Doctors' leaders have satisfied themselves that they have a satisfactory system for giving patients doses of drugs that may kill them, but that that is okay if it is only a secondary consequence of relieving pain. That is what I call the nudge and a wink approach to putting you out of your misery-very British.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000028"></a>With this confused situation, it is hardly surprising that year-on-year, we see a steady flow of mercy killing cases appear in our courts. Some of them look similar in circumstance but end up with different outcomes in decisions to prosecute or in court outcomes. In the recent Gilderdale case, the judge criticised the CPS for prosecuting. That does not bode well for the DPP's new guidelines. Personally, I think that Keir Starmer has done as well as anyone could expect with the poisoned legal chalice passed to him by Parliament and the Supreme Court.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000029"></a>We know that the law in this area is a mess because the Law Commission told us so in its review of murder law in 2006. It recommended that a further review was needed on mercy killings and other connected issues, such as assisted suicide, which would include assisted dying. The Government have declined to take up that recommendation but should, in my view, reconsider their position.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000030"></a>That is a brief summary of the policy and legal confusion, but there is also a lack of symmetry between governed and governing. Survey after survey for a decade or more has shown that the public want some form of change to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people who are competent to make that decision. The recently published 2010 British social attitudes survey showed that 82 per cent of the public support assisted dying. Parliament-Commons and Lords-lags behind public opinion on this issue but, as in so many areas, the plates are shifting. In 2006, 33 per cent of participating Peers voted in favour of the Bill on assisted dying of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe. In 2009, 42 per cent of Peers who took part in, or listened to, the debate on an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill to safeguard those who assist people going to Switzerland to die voted in favour of it. In the Commons, a higher proportion of MPs now seem to support change than in 1997, when Joe Ashton brought forward his Bill on doctor-assisted dying.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000031"></a>I do not expect the Government to bring forward legislation, but they should try harder to bring some greater order to the increasingly chaotic policy and legal situation. The position continues to change in other countries. We now have the experience of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Oregon and Washington State to draw upon, with Montana likely to join them soon. The DPP's guidelines are unlikely to produce stability. The Government's own end of life strategy is incomplete in this area and will continue to cause the issue to be raised.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000032"></a>Now Sir Terry Pratchett has suggested a practical way forward for helping doctors out of the quandary in which they find themselves: a medical legal tribunal to which people who want assisted dying can apply. That is not much different from the situation now, where applications can be made to the High Court to switch off a brain-dead patient's ventilator. Of course, we still have the Law Commission's recommendation lying on the table.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000033"></a>There is a lot of material for an independent review to get its teeth into. There is a raft of medical, legal, ethical and other knots to untangle, as I have indicated. This is territory that in an earlier time we would have handed over to a royal commission. I do not much mind what one calls such an inquiry, provided its terms of reference are wide enough and its membership carries public confidence and avoids sectarian capture.</p>

Two very recent polls suggest overwhelming support: one put it at 75 per cent; the other at 82 per cent. In fact, all polls on assisted dying show that an overwhelming majority of people wish a change in the law. Opponents argue that the questions put to the public are biased but, given how many polls have been conducted, all with differing questions, surely one by now would have shown a result other than overwhelming support, but there is not one.</p>

I would advise against patronising the electorate, who understand suffering all too well. I would also advise against paternalism, no matter how well intentioned. Parliament must wake up; assisted death will happen at some point in the near future, hastened on by the clamour of society at large. More importantly than that, it has to happen in order to relieve the suffering of those who can no longer endure intractable distress.</p>

They undoubtedly make a case for change, but these cases and this publicity have obscured real and cogent arguments to the contrary, which will be made during this debate. My main concern is the position of elderly and vulnerable people who already feel that they are a drag on their family and friends, and that they should die even if, deep down, they may not actually wish to do so. They may feel impelled to agree to die. I am also concerned about the tip of the iceberg. Once legislation is in place, it can that much more easily be extended. The issues and arguments are clear; it is unnecessary to have a further inquiry.</p>

That he articulated the majority view of the population is not disputed. However, he did not speak for disabled and terminally ill people. Not a single organisation of or for disabled and terminally ill people supports a change in the law. Does it not seem strange that those identified as beneficiaries of assisted dying are not insisting that their organisations campaign for a change in the law?

Parliament is there not to bend to every media-manipulated public whim, but to take the larger and longer view. We do not see in the press the old lady who last summer told me several times that she just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up, but who eventually made a full recovery and celebrated her 63rd wedding anniversary last month and greeted her sixth great-grandchild last week. Had we been in Holland or Oregon, someone might have "compassionately" given her a paper to sign and the deed would have been done. I declare an interest: the lady in question is my mother.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000046"></a>Last summer I sympathised with her view-her desire to die-but I shuddered at the thought of speeding her on her way. That would not have been compassion but, rather, collusion with distorted desire. The assisted suicide lobby does not have a monopoly on compassion. I believe that it distorts the notion radically. The genuinely compassionate course includes the remarkable work of palliative care, in which we in this country are field leaders, particularly through the hospice movement. We do not need a further independent inquiry.</p>

It is important that our response to the lot of those who suffer from terminal illness or progressive disability is not to contemplate assisted dying as the final or only solution. If you have lived in close proximity to suicide or life-limiting illness, you will know that these matters are not simple. There is huge grief and emotional pain; those are not the foundations on which we should build.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000048"></a>The protection and preservation of life is the most fundamental and important duty of the state under the law. To live with life-limiting illness is to live with uncertainty. Today the law protects individuals from mercy killing-for that, ultimately, is what assisted suicide is. They know that if someone determines that their life is no longer of value and takes steps to end that life, the law will intervene. They know, at least,

Apart from Switzerland, we normally tend to talk about only the Netherlands and Oregon. A similar law to that of the Netherlands was passed in Belgium, where it has continued to operate successfully since 2002. Recently, Luxembourg passed a similar law, and simultaneously included laws covering palliative care, advanced decisions and carers' leave.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000056"></a>As well as in Oregon, in the United States the system has been largely adopted by the neighbouring state of Washington. In a vote at the same time as the recent presidential elections, 58 per cent of Washington voters approved the change in the law, which is now in force.

On that subject, he should be careful in his criticism on the case of Gilderdale, in which the judge held that there was a case to answer on a charge not of assisted suicide but of attempted murder.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000059"></a>My second point is about the impracticability of what is behind the proposal for an inquiry. The fact that a speech containing such a proposal is made by someone who is rightly regarded as a national treasure, a wonderful author speaking from the heart and using fine language, does not make him right. The fact is that the Pratchett proposals are at least as weak as the proposals made earlier by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and heavily defeated in this House.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000060"></a>My third point is that we have already had the inquiry. No one has mentioned the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, so far in this debate, but some of us, including myself and some who have spoken already, were on that committee. I wonder if some noble Lords who have spoken today have taken the trouble to read the report, which contains every fact on both sides of this argument.

<p><a name="100203117000063"></a>The first is the fallacy that the DPP is in some way in a neutral position. He is not. Under the Suicide Act 1961, he is obliged to give his consent to any prosecution. That does not mean that he is entitled, nor indeed obliged, to seek to change the law, but that is practically what he is now almost invited to do.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000064"></a>The next fallacy is that one can proceed down the path of legitimising assisted suicide but not eventually lead to the issue of euthanasia, whether that be voluntary or involuntary. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, has already referred to the ravings of Martin Amis in this connection.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000065"></a>The final fallacy is that you can in some way determine this matter by a public inquiry. We have had a surfeit of public inquiries and all the facts are well known. If you set up a royal commission to deal with the ethical and moral matters, you are then in even greater difficulty; you might as well set up a royal commission to determine doctrinal theology.</p>

That detailed debate was prevented by a cunning tactical ploy by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. It astonishes me that he refers with such confidence to that Select Committee because, as it happens, I have established that although no vote was taken in the committee, a majority of seven of its 13 members ended up by supporting assisted dying.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000067"></a>Surely, against that background, the 80 per cent of society in our democracy who consistently support assisted dying are entitled to the inquiry proposed by my noble friend Lord Warner, at which the issue can be calmly and objectively considered, based on research and evidence, rather than on conjecture and speculation about what might happen by those who hope that it will not.</p>

Further, who can fail to feel revulsion at the different treatment of Mrs Inglis and Mrs Gilderdale? They were charged with different offences in different circumstances, but both acted nobly out of deep compassion to assist in the suicide of a loved one. There were very different outcomes: one was acquitted; the other has to serve nine years. In the case of Mrs Inglis, if the jury had had any guts or compassion it would have defied the law, as juries have with unjust laws in the past, and acquitted her.

In reality, vulnerable people need protection. As things stand, about 1,500 deaths each year are a result of doctors ending life without an explicit request to die from the patient.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000076"></a>The most comprehensive research on assisted dying legislation and its impact on vulnerable people by Margaret Battin et al in 2007 examined data from Oregon and the Netherlands. They looked at vulnerable groups, including chronically ill and disabled people.

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000077"></a>Finally, surveys consistently show that a majority of groups that might be considered vulnerable, including elderly and disabled people, support a change in the law to allow assisted dying for terminally ill people. I would very much welcome an independent inquiry in this area. It would highlight the importance of legislation to protect vulnerable people.</p>

We have seen cases of Britons travelling abroad to die, people committing suicide behind closed doors and, just this week, as has been referred to, loving parents assisting their children to die. These cases are not going to go away; if anything, they are likely to increase as the media spotlight gives courage to others to follow their lead. As things stand, we are exporting the problem to other countries' jurisdictions, while at the same time failing to provide proper protection from potential coercion or abuse.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000079"></a>These complex cases give us a particular challenge, but we should not be making up the law on assisted dying as a knee-jerk reaction to them. That is why I support an independent inquiry into the issue to enable a serious measured response to all the issues surrounding this important debate, away from the media spotlight.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000081"></a>Let us take, for example, the issue of mental competence. I think that noble Lords will agree that the decision to die requires the highest test to be satisfied. An inquiry would allow us to define in advance how the complexities of mental competence, depressive thinking and undue influence could be assessed properly in practice. Does it not make more sense to review mental competence and the influence of mental state before the event via a safeguarded law, as opposed to afterwards via an investigation of a mercy killing and a potential prosecution? I think so.</p>

I totally disagree with the view that an independent inquiry is not a suitable vehicle for coming to moral decisions. A truly independent inquiry has time, its members can listen to one another's arguments and, above all, when they come to their inquiry they will not be in an already entrenched position.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000084"></a>We are not likely, in this House or the other place, to come to a consensus on this important issue. We are all too much entrenched as lawyers, priests, doctors or philosophers. An independent inquiry is exactly what is needed now, and it would not overshadow the results of the Select Committee chaired so ably by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. I am very much in favour of this proposal.</p>

As all the recent cases show, the current law on assisted dying is the source of much unhappiness and misery. It is constantly circumvented, it is out of pace with public opinion and it is increasingly becoming discredited. Desperate individuals who seek relief from unbearable or unrelievable pain want to take their lives, and they either go to Switzerland, lean on sympathetic doctors or turn to botched or highly gruesome forms of suicide. The law therefore needs to change.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000086"></a>It is obvious that we have had a lot of public and parliamentary debate on this subject. Why do we need an inquiry? I think we do because much of the debate is either not based on evidence, or based on wrong conclusions drawn from the evidence, or based on certain hypothetical fears and arguments not properly considered. We therefore need an independent inquiry that could look at the evidence more impartially.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000087"></a>Often we are told that we do not need to worry about assisted suicide because there is palliative care, but palliative care does not address the same question. Much pain is unrelieved, and palliative care does not address the issues of dignity and autonomy, nor does it address the simple fact that one might have reached the point where one does not wish to live or to become a burden either to society or to those that one deeply loves.</p>

Many points have been made. I just wish to stress that if there is an independent inquiry-whatever "independent" might mean here-it should recognise that the safety of the people is the fundamental purpose of legislation. In my view, the draft legislation that we have debated in the past has not paid sufficient attention to that.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000089"></a>This debate has been polarised between autonomous choice and those who do not favour it. If we get serious about autonomy, we have to realise that much choice is impulsive, and measures have been suggested for dealing with that. However, I have not seen any good way for dealing with choices made when depressed, and we have not even begun to discuss choices made out of deference.</p>

Current English law on assisted suicide for terminally ill and mentally competent adults is not satisfactory; it sweeps too broadly and leaves too much discretion to prosecutors and too much uncertainty to patients and those who care for them.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000093"></a>An exception to the law of homicide is needed to give mentally competent adults the choice of a medically assisted death if they have a terminal illness and no possibility of recovery and they have a clear, settled and informed wish to die. There need to be strong and effective safeguards against abuse by relatives, friends or anyone else. That is why a decriminalising measure must ensure that assistance is given only by doctors and nurses and only in accordance with good medical practice.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000094"></a>An objective independent inquiry would provide evidence and informed opinion on whether and how such an exception should be made. It is needed for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and others. We have nothing to fear but fear itself.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203117000194"></a>"If you're demented, you're wasting people's lives-your family's lives-and you're wasting the resources of the National Health Service",</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000096"></a>Alison Davis was severely disabled at birth with multiple defects. She bravely bore all these until she was diagnosed with an incurable disease. Her repeated requests for euthanasia were refused, and there followed three serious suicide attempts. She was rescued by her friends, who persuaded her that her life was worth living. She formed a charity looking after orphans in India and has found the past 15 years the happiest that she has ever had. She said to the Select Committee that if euthanasia had been legalised, she would have been deprived of the best years of her life. What have noble Lords to say to that?</p>

This is not the first occasion on which the House has had the opportunity to debate the issue of assisted dying, and obviously it will not be the last. On this occasion, as on previous ones, we have heard passionately held but deeply divided views.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000098"></a>By any standards this is a very distinguished cast list, and I thank all noble Lords for the discipline that they have shown in their speeches and, of course, for what they have said. My belief is that tomorrow's copies of <I>Hansard</I> should sell like hot cakes because the arguments for and against change in this field have rarely, if ever, been put so concisely and so well.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000099"></a>The moral and ethical questions surrounding this issue have been well rehearsed. Time is short-although, I fear, not short for me-so I will focus on what my noble friend has asked: namely, what consideration the Government have given to holding an independent inquiry on assisted dying to examine the evidence for and against a change in the law. As he reminded the Committee, in an Oral Question last October my noble friend raised the issue of an independent inquiry or commission. I said then that it was an idea that I would take back.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000100"></a>A public inquiry is a long-term commitment. Whatever the merits of an independent inquiry on this issue, I have to tell the Committee that realistically there is little prospect of such an inquiry being set up during what remains of this Parliament. At this stage, debating the possibility is academic. However, the question of whether there should be an inquiry will almost certainly arise again in the next Parliament. Therefore, it is more than useful to have this opportunity to consider the issue.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000101"></a>I and the Government have made clear on previous occasions that our view is that any change to the law in this area is, of course, an issue of individual conscience. It is rightly a matter for Parliament, rather than government policy, to decide. We therefore take a neutral view when others seek to change the law. To be clear: this means neither standing in the way of such a change nor actively pursuing it.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000102"></a>There are of course options open to Parliament if it wants to look at the issue of assisted dying, whether in relation to people who are terminally ill or more widely. One such option would be consideration by a Select Committee. Indeed, as we have heard, the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, brought by my noble friend, Lord Joffe, was considered at some length by a Select Committee, mentioned in this debate, and chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, which reported in April 2005.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000103"></a>Beyond such options, the question of holding an independent inquiry on the issue is not as straightforward as it may seem. I hope that noble Lords will appreciate that, whatever a Government may say, it may not be perceived as neutral for us to facilitate any such action. Even if we remain entirely neutral on the moral issues involved, the very fact of setting up such an inquiry would be seen by some as tantamount to a policy decision that the law should be changed. In the debate, it was interesting that those in favour of change were very keen on an inquiry and those who were against change were equally keen for there not to be one.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000104"></a>The Government have not been blind to the extremely high public profile that this issue has had over many months-particularly in the past few weeks and days-or to the growing pressure to put in place a mechanism to allow the issue to be properly looked at. Our postbag in the Ministry of Justice reflects the very real concerns that members of the public have about this issue and, I am afraid, the extent to which it polarises opinion. Some people have called for a public consultation but, in the absence of any policy proposals-and such proposals could be difficult to formulate when starting from a position of neutrality-a public consultation would be unfocused and unlikely to reach any meaningful conclusions.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000105"></a>Of course a public inquiry can be a good way of responding to an issue or events that have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern. In theory, I do not doubt that the sort of independent inquiry that my noble friend envisages and argues so strongly for would be a good way of ensuring that all the relevant issues around assisted suicide were properly addressed. These include personal beliefs, personal autonomy, safeguarding the vulnerable and medical ethics, among others. Evidence could be taken from all relevant disciplines, including health professionals for whom any relaxation of the law could, and probably would, have significant implications. However, we argue that in practice there is a very real question about whether such an inquiry could be expected to resolve this extremely divisive issue.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000106"></a>Let us leave aside for a moment the question of whether it would be appropriate for the Government to set up an inquiry and, instead, look at some of the considerations that would necessarily be involved in doing so. Under the Inquiries Act 2005, Ministers can establish an inquiry, appoint the inquiry panel and set the terms of reference for that inquiry without the need for resolutions of Parliament. Indeed, we debated this matter in another context throughout last summer. Although the inquiry is independent, sponsoring Ministers will be accountable to Parliament for its spending and governance.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000107"></a>Even the best-managed inquiry will inevitably involve significant costs and resources, although there is no argument against that. As this House knows, controlling the costs of such inquiries was a prime motivation for the 2005 Act. Surely, therefore, before deciding whether to hold a public inquiry, it is sensible for Ministers to be very clear that the benefits of the inquiry, in both the short and longer term, will be worth while, given the expenditure of costs, time and effort.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000108"></a>A crucial factor in controlling the cost of any inquiry is its terms of reference. They must be tightly drafted to establish the scope of the inquiry. The sponsoring Minister has responsibility for setting the terms of reference, although the Inquiries Act specifically requires him or her to consult the chairman on them. This helps to ensure that they have a shared idea of the scope and purpose of the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000112"></a>I was talking about the benefits of inquiries and pointing out-I hope sensibly-that the legal, administrative, practical and resource implications of any change to the law are considerable. There are many different aspects to this complex issue and so the range of options that an inquiry could be asked to consider is potentially very wide. Our real worry is that however carefully we drafted the terms of reference, there could be no certainty that such an inquiry would reach a consensus or anything like it. Given the deeply divided views on this issue it would be necessary to ensure a balanced membership, which might make reaching a consensus even more difficult. I do not think that a majority of seven to six either way would constitute a good result.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000113"></a>Indeed, the Select Committee that considered the Bill of my noble friend Lord Joffe, to which I have referred already, from March 2004 to March 2005 did not take a position either way on this central issue. The danger, although I am not saying that it is inevitable, is that we could embark on a time-consuming and potentially very expensive exercise that might not take us very much, or any, further forward.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000114"></a>As I have said, this is clearly not an issue that can be resolved in what remains of this Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that the debate will continue in one form or another in the next Parliament. In the mean time, I again thank my noble friend Lord Warner for raising the issue and I thank all those who have contributed so well to today's debate. It once again reinforces the importance of Parliament in providing a forum for considering this huge ethical issue.</p>

I am very grateful to all those Peers who have come today to expand on different aspects of the problem. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us this evening that the Government understand the issues and will act to ensure that the mobility of those citizens is not seriously compromised.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000116"></a>The streets and public spaces in this country are increasingly busy and complex. Some of us are in cars, buses or lorries, and others are on two-wheeled vehicles, such as bicycles and motorcycles. Those of us on two feet have for some time been the poor relations. Traffic control systems favour the motorist and, to a lesser extent, the cyclist. The pedestrian space is often, by comparison with the roads, poorly maintained and cluttered with advertising frames and extraneous signs.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000117"></a>Therefore, it should be a welcome development that the concept of shared space has arrived. It seeks to strike a fairer balance, giving vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists a better deal. It also seeks to create more pleasant public spaces that we can all enjoy, free of clutter and unnecessary signage. Why, then, are blind and partially sighted people across the country vociferously opposed to these developments? It is simply because in delivering the concept, many town planners and designers are introducing shared-surface streets. In those designs, it is not only the clutter that is removed. Kerbs and, often, controlled crossings, are banished.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000118"></a>The idea is that with the removal of these features, a more ambiguous environment is created which, being more difficult to interpret, and with the risk that pedestrians may be sharing the same space, encourages motorists to drive more cautiously and courteously. It is expected that priority in the shared-space area is negotiated, primarily through making eye contact.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000119"></a>It is obvious that such negotiation is impossible for those who are blind or partially sighted. To understand the full impact, we need also to recognise the importance of delineating the space that pedestrians use. Kerbs have traditionally been used for that purpose, and blind and partially sighted people use them to navigate and orientate themselves in our streets. They also have the confidence that, while on the pavement, they are relatively safe and out of the path of vehicles. When they want to cross the road, they look for controlled crossings, indicated by tactile paving, or they can seek the assistance of sighted pedestrians to use uncontrolled crossings.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000120"></a>With shared-surface streets there is no physical delineation. The kerb is gone, and if you cannot tell where the pavement ends and the road begins, how can you feel safe? The impact of shared-surface streets is to undermine the mobility and confidence of blind and partially sighted people. They are unable to use those spaces independently. In the worst case, people will now avoid those areas altogether, and so will be unable to access the shops and other services in their own town centre.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000121"></a>In focus group research carried out by Guide Dogs, blind and partially sighted people reported that they were concerned about the safety risk, the reduction in their independence and the lack of effective consultation  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with them as a user group. The research was carried out in both the UK and the Netherlands, where the shared space concept originated and where, we are told, it has been a success, but the experience and concerns of blind and partially sighted people in both countries were very similar. As one participant commented, "I do not enjoy going to town any more. I am stressed before getting there". In the 21st century, we should not be creating streetscapes that exclude our citizens in this way.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000122"></a>The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 introduced the disability equality duty. Local authorities are charged with promoting equality for disabled people. This also applies to the street environment and should ensure that streets are inclusively designed so that they are safe and accessible for all disabled people. Yet, in many of the shared-space schemes there has been no meaningful involvement of disabled people. In some cases, the local authority has not even produced a disability equality impact assessment either. This would suggest that the Government and the Equality and Human Rights Commission need to do more to promote and enforce the law.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000123"></a>Guide Dogs has led a campaign to raise awareness of these issues and to call for a stop to the introduction of shared-space designs, at least until we have the results of research which the Government are carrying out. The campaign is supported by 38 other organisations representing not only blind and partially sighted people but those with learning difficulties, those who are deaf or hard of hearing and people with physical disabilities. The lack of delineation can make the streets more difficult to understand for a person with a learning disability. If you are a deaf person signing to a friend, it is easy to stray into traffic if there is no effective delineation. The disabled are not the only people affected. The shared-space environment is likely to be much more frightening for elderly people, and small children are told to stop at the kerb's edge, look and listen before crossing the road. How can they do that if there is not a kerb?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000124"></a>It is often argued that physically disabled people, particularly those who use wheelchairs, prefer a level space. It is certainly true that a level, well maintained surface is easier to negotiate, but that can surely be achieved in a scheme where there is adequate delineation through the installation of well designed dropped kerbs. My noble friend Lord Crisp will, I think, talk a bit more about safety but the first output from the Government's research suggests that there is no evidence one way or the other to support the safety case. While there may be fewer serious accidents, there may well be more near misses, and it is those near misses that undermine so seriously the confidence of vulnerable pedestrians and lead to them avoiding shared spaces altogether.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000125"></a>Guide Dogs has carried out two kinds of research-some into the views and experiences of blind and partially sighted people, and some into ways that shared-surface streets could be modified so as to retain the benefits without sacrificing the interests of blind and partially sighted people. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will say a word about the Guide Dogs research but I want to say a word about the Government's  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>research. I have already mentioned that the Government have commissioned their own research in response to representations made by Guide Dogs, with support from the National Federation of the Blind, the RNIB and others. Mention of the RNIB reminds me that I should declare an interest in this whole debate, both a personal one and an organisational one.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000126"></a>The aim of the two-year project that the Government have set up is to provide an evidence base for the production of guidance on how shared space can be made to work for all users, including disabled people. The guidance is due to be delivered in 2011 but the initial outputs do not suggest that the interests of disabled people are being adequately addressed. In the first phase of the work, only people who were using these spaces were interviewed. Of the 55 people interviewed, only eight were disabled and only one was visually impaired. What of the people who are no longer using the space? How are their views to be considered?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000127"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us this evening that the research will properly consider the impact on disabled people, particularly blind and partially sighted people. There is a great deal riding on this work and it is vital that they get it right. Blind and partially sighted people and other groups supporting the campaign against shared-surface streets are not opposed to improving the public realm or to the creation of well designed, aesthetically pleasing streets and spaces. What they want to see, however, is the achievement of those aims as part of inclusive designs that they, too, are able to enjoy alongside the rest of the general public.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000128"></a>The Government need to take a lead. Last year, they issued a letter to local authorities to tell them about their research. They need now to go one step further and to encourage local authorities not to introduce shared-space schemes until the research is concluded. We are still a way from seeing the Government's guidance. In the mean time, local authorities across the country continue to introduce new shared-space schemes. Some are small areas-such as Holbein Place outside Sloane Square tube station-and others are larger scale, including the plans for Exhibition Road and the redevelopment of part of Stratford-upon-Avon. Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money will be spent on creating shared-surface streets that will, at best, be difficult for disabled people to use and, in some cases, will be completely unusable by them.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000129"></a>Is this the legacy we want to leave? I suggest not. The Government need to do more to ensure that we have a truly accessible public realm that reflects the very best in inclusive design by catering for the diverse needs of all our citizens. The Government say that their position is one of neutrality. Benign neutrality would certainly be an improvement, but a stance of neutrality is not good enough in a situation where local authorities are charging ahead-without listening to anybody-with schemes that are putting vulnerable people at risk and making them afraid to go about their lawful business in the streets of our towns and cities. Neutrality favours the status quo and the powerful. The Government need to throw their weight into the scale behind those who lack power and whose interests are being ridden roughshod over by the planning juggernaut in order to counterbalance the powerful.</p>

He is to be congratulated on tabling his Motion and securing this debate today.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000131"></a>I speak as someone who spent 10 years on the council of Guide Dogs for the Blind. In the course of that period I helped to set up, and was the first chairman of, a body called the Visual Handicap Group. It was the first time that the major voluntary bodies for the blind had come together to co-ordinate their responses. Guide Dogs in the past had tended to be somewhat aloof but, by taking part in the Visual Handicap Group, it came very much into the centre of the picture.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000132"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, has set out many of the issues which arise when considering this problem. I had a long discussion with the leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council to try to put these points to him and, although there was a certain amount of sympathy and so on, I found that I was up against a strongly held view that the shared streets and the visual improvements that they bring about are such strong drivers that they override everything else. When one considers Kensington High Street and, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, mentioned, Exhibition Road, one can understand what the council is aiming at. However, I find it strange that the main complaint the noble Lord, Lord Low, has had to make is that there has not been proper consultation with the bodies that represent the visually handicapped. The same is true of the other bodies affected by this change in the urban environment.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000133"></a>The noble Lord was talking about the issue: "Well, you're supposed to be able to make visual contact with the driver, the motorcyclist or whoever, so that you can manage to avoid each other". How do you train a guide dog to make visual contact with a car? Everyone knows that dogs always see their own reflections in glass. We have all had experience of that. It is a completely meaningless concept when applied to someone who is visually handicapped. The noble Lord, Lord Low, made that point clearly.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000134"></a>He suggested that I said a word about Guide Dogs' research. This is particularly important when you compare that research with people who use shared streets, rather than those who are shunning them. One of the respondents to the focus group research for Guide Dogs, when commenting on a scheme in Coventry, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203117000195"></a>"I simply keep away from this area-I stay away".</p>

<p><a name="100203117000191"></a>They do not feel safe. Without a kerb and without being able to see approaching traffic, it simply is not safe. In this day and age, it is very strange for a change to be promoted by local authorities which actually puts some of their more vulnerable citizens at risk of harm. Guide Dogs says-as, indeed, other noble Lords have said-that it is the absence of a kerb which has perhaps the most serious impact upon those who rely on sensory abilities, with a cane, dog or whatever, to know when they are possibly straying into the path of traffic. Guide Dogs' research has confirmed that for  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those with a visual handicap, the kerb is absolutely essential in helping them to get about.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000135"></a>A large amount of care, expense and trouble is devoted to helping people in wheelchairs to get about, using attachments on buses and all sorts of other things. Compare that with the absence of recognition that the kerb is such a vital feature of the urban scene. I find that very strange. Guide Dogs has found in its research that even if a kerb is only 50 millimetres, or roughly 2 inches, high, that makes all the difference if it enables blind people to continue to negotiate the street and feel safe.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000136"></a>I could go on but my time is up. This Question asks that there should be no more schemes, including those directed by the Government, until their research is complete. I wholeheartedly support that and hope that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will accept that as a proper thing for Parliament to ask of the Government.</p>
<h5><a name="100203117000235"></a>7.13 pm</h5>

<p><a name="100203117000137"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100203117000278"></a>Lord Crisp:</b> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble friend Lord Low on this Question, not because I know a great deal about this particular topic, although I am chair of Sightsavers International. In that role, I have become more conscious of how simple and rather unthinking things disadvantage people with disabilities. We have an example here. There is not much to say because, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, it seems obvious that people need to rethink, look at what is happening and then decide how best to go ahead.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000138"></a>I am reminded of how often good ideas can have unintended consequences by something that I was familiar with in the National Health Service. It concerned road humps, called "sleeping policemen", which have been introduced to improve safety. The London Ambulance Service found them to be a major problem in terms of delivering its services. I very often saw the correspondence and the research, which argued that while overall they would reduce accidents and improve safety, unless they were placed in such a way as to support ambulance routes, one might have problems in terms both of the speed with which an ambulance reached its destination-with more lives or limbs being lost because of it-and of not being able to drive it as smoothly as one would want. When you introduce things before the consequences have been worked through-or when you do work through the consequences but do not rethink-you get into trouble that can be sustained over years. I happen to know that that argument with the London Ambulance Service has been going on around London for some years.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000139"></a>The proposal in the Question seems a very good idea. I am indebted to Guide Dogs for some examples of where shared space can and cannot work. Kensington High Street is said to be an example in practice. In that scheme, guard-railing has been removed, the street has been decluttered, cycle racks have been relocated to a central reservation and accident rates have fallen dramatically. However, Kensington High Street has maintained kerbs and controlled crossings; it is not a shared-surface street. Shared space can, it seems, be delivered without recourse to a shared-surface design, and that is the issue that we need to talk about.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000140"></a>There is scheme in Ashford in Kent which incorporates both shared surface and kerbed sections. It has been much heralded in the design press but only recently the council has had to introduce large plastic blocks to reroute traffic and prevent parking, as well as to install signs to advise sighted pedestrians to look out for vehicles. It is being modified.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000141"></a>The other example that has been quoted by both the noble Lord, Lord Low, and Lord Jenkin, is the Holbein Place scheme by Sloane Square, which was introduced only last year and has already seen modifications. Modifications are a good thing if something is not working, but is there not scope here to learn? Is not that, as I understand it, the point of the review that the Government are conducting? Would it not be sensible to wait until that review is completed before local councils press on?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000142"></a>On safety, although it is clear from the statistics that accident rates have fallen dramatically in Kensington High Street in London, the sort of accidents we are talking about have not been designated, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said. It may be the case that if cars are driving less fast, we are seeing less serious accidents, but there does not appear to be any count of people with disabilities or, as the noble Lord said, of how many near misses there are or how many people have avoided the area because of their worries about safety. There is not a clear picture about safety.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000143"></a>Let us think more widely about planning. People tend to plan on the basis of what is good for those who are-what is the right language?-normally abled, and then add on things for other people. Surely they should look at planning inclusively-for everyone in society-right from the start. We should not need to have this discussion about the interests of people who are blind or partially sighted after the event. Should that not have been what planning based on inclusivity and diversity was all about in the first place? I hope that the Minister will listen to the pleas from those of us in this Room and send to local authorities what seems a very simple message: why do you not wait for the evidence before you act further?</p>

I have some experience from my role at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in supporting the pioneering work of creating so-called "home zones", where the pedestrian, not the car, is king. Barriers such as trees and benches make roads meander and confine cars to some 5 mph. I have four, brief comments to make.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000145"></a>First, the concept of making the car subservient to the pedestrian has endeavoured to make urban living more amenable, allowing children to play outside the home and people to socialise without worrying about the traffic. It aims to reduce accidents and prevent the need for those in wheelchairs or with mobility problems to worry about crossing the road safely. So far, these have proved popular and successful. I would not want the home zone concept to be threatened by new regulations.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000146"></a>Secondly, I have experienced the shared public spaces that are so common in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and elsewhere in mainland Europe. These areas have civilised many town centres and side streets, and have become an important part of efforts to encourage older people not to move out of towns and cities to the country or the seaside.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000147"></a>Thirdly, I know that more than 20 years ago some of those who represented blind and partially sighted people were opposed to dropped kerbs, which have, in the end, proved popular with wheelchair users and people with other disabilities, as well as mothers with baby buggies and the rest of us. I do not think that consultation with the appropriate representative bodies at that time was very good, but when there was that consultation, a compromise was reached: tactile paving. This satisfied the requirements of those with visual impairments and was, in the end, to the satisfaction of all parties. It would seem important to agree on similar delineation of shared-surface streets. I understand that such delineation has been designed into the large-scale shared spaces of the Olympic village now in development. I hope the tactile lines being used there will satisfy those who are concerned about shared spaces so that we can achieve the best of all worlds here for all users in the future.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000148"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100203117000280"></a>Lord Addington:</b> My Lords, this is one of those debates where you have not thought about the subject, but you look at it and say, "I can see that there is a problem". It is clear that the noble Lord, Lord Low, has pointed out something which seems to have been missed and, according to the DDA 2005, should have been taken into account. Something should have been done. We thought that planning would be taken on board when we discussed that Bill. Somebody somewhere has messed up in this process, but as we go over it in greater detail tonight is probably not the time to start the witch hunt.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000149"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Best, has just pointed out, we can probably do this better and get some of the benefits. However, we will have to find a new way of looking at this type of problem to get such benefits. Two immediate ways come to mind. One is to invest in training for those who drive vehicles in these areas. That would be piecemeal, would take a long time to become effective and-as we know for all forms of training-will occasionally be forgotten. When people get cross or are late for something, they will revert to normal practice or drive badly. Some people simply drive badly; there are no two ways about it. The alternative is to put in some design features.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000150"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, has already pointed out that it may be that you cannot engage in this interaction or that you are going to do it badly. Anybody who has ever had a bad leg experiences how, when crossing roads, you do so at a different pace. You take your time; you may have to stop. A couple of periods on crutches taught me exactly how bad the London Underground is for disabled people far better than any textbook could have done. How will those people fit into this? If somebody is in a wheelchair, looking to make eye contact, there are certain vehicles that they

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000151"></a>The only scheme that I can comment on is the one at Holbein Place, because I use it, sometimes in the company of my seven year-old daughter. It is not good. Grumpy drivers who are not used to coming round that corner find themselves having to brake suddenly. There have been one or two low-level impacts that I have seen. They will not appear because most people usually just swear at each other and move on, but they occurred. This type of occasion will give that area a bad reputation among certain groups, as has been pointed out.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000152"></a>We need more work here. At the least, an elaborate series of warnings must be established for both groups when they are going into these areas, and people must know what is happening when they are approaching them. Unless that happens, we are going to effectively disadvantage certain groups and make it more difficult for them to travel safely in these areas. It is a nice idea-it is one that I had not thought I would share, as someone who regards himself as still being able to do that quick run when someone comes up and does not stop and then slows down-but are we sure that we have got this right?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000153"></a>Can we please have some idea of the Government's thinking about how we develop this? How are we going to tackle this problem? If we do not, we are basically going to feed the lawyers at some point, and we will find ourselves with groups of people taking part in long-running campaigns. I have been involved in these matters in the past, and whoever is on the Treasury Bench gets a vaguely punch-drunk look about them as we come back to this issue again and again. I think we want to avoid that.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000156"></a>Shared-space schemes mark a departure from conventionally designed streets because, as we have heard, they involve minimal use of traffic signs, road markings and other traffic management features. Instead, with no indication of priority or clear traffic management, motorists are encouraged to recognise the space as being different from a traditional road and to react by driving more slowly and responding to other road users, including pedestrians-a sort of free-for-all. By and large they work well, provided that you are fleet of foot and in command of all your faculties. For the deaf, the blind, the partially sighted, the very old and the very young or those with physical or mental difficulties they can be, and are, problematic.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000158"></a>When I was thinking what on earth I was going to say in this debate, I thought, "How would I feel if I was blind and was confronted with one of these shared-surface schemes?". I want to set the Minister a challenge: we take the Minister within 20 yards of one of these schemes, blindfold him and set him the task of walking up to the shared-space scheme and then crossing diagonally from one corner to the other. We will give the Minister the choice of one of two accessories: either a stick or a dog on a lead. By the way, as the Minister nears the shared space, there is no comfort zone where he can rest safely, collect his wits and pluck up courage before his ordeal.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100203-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000159"></a>The Minister's accessory of choice is just that, an accessory; it will be of little use in completing his task. If he chooses the stick it will be of little value because the shared space is flat-the pavement is flush with the road-and no amount of tapping will help to orientate him. If he chooses the dog, it will be next to useless, as it has been trained to stop at a pavement edge-but there is none. So we set the Minister down, 20 yards from the crossing, point him in the right direction and tell him, "Off you go, you are on your own", but he is not on his own, is he? He will encounter lorries, buses, vans, cars, motorbikes, push bikes and a plethora of pedestrians crossing his path. If the Minister accepted that challenge, how would he feel? No doubt he would feel anxious and apprehensive; I certainly would. It would be like playing Russian roulette. The Minister might-we all hope that he would-survive his ordeal, but some who are blind or disabled may have to undertake that ordeal twice a day to get to work, school or the shops. That stressful task may put them off using the shared space at all, and they may choose a long detour rather than run the risk.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000160"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Low, just told us, in a survey, in 44 per cent of replies from the blind, they said that they would go out of their way to avoid those schemes. We must make sure that we do not exclude a section of society by our lack of thought in planning.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000161"></a>The Minister can relax: we are not really going to make him run the gauntlet, but I have one or two questions to ask him. Before I do that, I hope that I have not offended anyone with my rather light-hearted challenge to him. The intention was to bring to those of us with good sight the stark reality of the problems that blind people must overcome daily. We have little or no comprehension of their problems with everyday tasks which we take for granted. Of all the senses to live without, sight must be the most difficult. The noble Lord, Lord Low, in his opening remarks convincingly described some of the difficulties encountered. I do not plan to repeat his arguments, but when planning for these shared spaces, we really should think more carefully.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000162"></a>Now to my questions. Has the Minister considered new textures and colouring schemes to help to differentiate the road from pedestrian areas, as has already been  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suggested? Has he considered the Guide Dogs for the Blind idea for a 60 millimetre kerb to act as a guiding device, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin said? More importantly, how will the Minister ensure that the planners of those schemes also consider those points? The Department for Transport report states that shared space schemes,</p>
<ul><a name="100203117000202"></a>"are not primarily intended to address road safety issues".</ul>
<p><a name="100203117000192"></a>I have a difficulty with that statement, because I thought that the whole point of them was to make vehicles slow down and pay greater attention to other road users, therefore putting safety very much on the agenda.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000163"></a>The Government themselves have acknowledged that there are gaps in their data on safety and that the schemes may pose difficulties for blind and partially sighted people. They have also announced that they have begun a research project on how to make shared-surface streets work for all road users. Can we be updated on what that will involve, its progress so far, and when the research will be completed?</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000164"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response to my questions and others raised in this debate-in particular, the question of whether the Government intend to request local authorities not to introduce more schemes until their research on shared space is concluded.</p>
<h5><a name="100203117000239"></a>7.34 pm</h5>

<p><a name="100203117000165"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100203117000282"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this fascinating debate this evening, especially the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, who has such a magnificent record in pursuing matters of concern to disabled people and whom I congratulate on initiating this debate. He is a distinguished leader of the RNIB, an organisation with which the Department for Transport has had a constructive working relationship over many years. Indeed, the consultancy arm of the RNIB is part of the contractor's team currently working on our shared-space project. I thank him for giving me this opportunity to explain our position on shared-surface streets today.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000166"></a>We attach a great deal of importance to the travel needs of disabled people and we are determined to deliver an inclusive transport network that is accessible to everyone. Over the past three or four decades, the department has promoted improvements ranging from dropped kerbs and tactile paving to audio announcements on buses and trains, for example. It has long appreciated the importance of inclusivity in design and provision. Work currently under way will result in comprehensive guidance on the design and provision of shared space, which includes shared-surface streets. We involve interested parties in guidance preparation and have a wide range of stakeholders, including Guide Dogs for the Blind and representatives of other disabled groups, working with us on the shared-space project.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000167"></a>In February 2009, we commenced the current two-year research project on shared space-to answer the noble Earl's question, it will be completed in 2011-and an appraisal report was published on the department's website on 19 November 2009. The appraisal report concluded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203117000196"></a>"From the data available, there is no evidence that Shared Space schemes, including those with level surfaces, as implemented  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the UK have more casualties than conventional layouts, or that particular groups, including disabled people, are injured more frequently following their introduction".</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000168"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, said that this did not support the safety case. We are not claiming that these schemes improve safety, although emerging anecdotal evidence suggests that they may do so. Shared space is essentially an initiative to improve the quality of life for everyone. He asked particularly about near misses. These are not recorded so I cannot comment authoritatively on them. However, among road users generally, sometimes the closeness of a near miss is exaggerated as time passes. I do not underestimate their importance and the degree of alarm that an apparent near miss can cause to disabled people, particularly to blind people.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000169"></a>I stress that the appraisal report is not the last word on the subject but we believe that its conclusions were entirely reasonable given the data that were available to the researchers. We will be collecting and evaluating additional data as they become available and this will feed into the final guidance.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000170"></a>In his excellent speech, the noble Lord, Lord Low, claimed that accident data are a bit of a blunt tool for assessing these schemes. However, it is the best that we have and it is likely to be a more reliable indicator than focus group surveys, for example. Over the past few years, Guide Dogs has repeatedly claimed that shared-surface streets pose a particular danger to visually impaired people, partly because of the supposed need for making eye contact with drivers before crossing the road. This was mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Addington. The appraisal considered the eye contact issue and determined that there is no convincing data that eye contact is used predominantly as a means of communication between drivers and pedestrians. For example, it is often impossible for pedestrians to see through windscreens and into vehicles. Given the lack of certainty with which drivers and pedestrians can establish eye contact, it would be highly improbable that drivers rely on it. The report concluded that drivers appear to base their intended actions primarily on actual or anticipated pedestrian behaviour rather than on direct communication.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000171"></a>When we point out that we have no firm evidence to suggest that shared surfaces are any less safe than conventional streets, Guide Dogs and speakers in today's debate claim that this is because visually impaired people avoid these areas. Guide Dogs also says that shared surfaces are dangerous for people with hearing difficulties, people with learning difficulties, other disabled people, older people and children. We have considered this but we have been unable to find any documentary evidence that might substantiate claims of increased danger to any of these user groups. In addition, it seems very unlikely that people in these groups are failing to show up in accident statistics because they avoid shared space.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000172"></a>During the appraisal stage, views on shared space were gathered from a range of user types, including disabled people and those described as "frail older", which I suspect might include some Members of your Lordships' House. This was a random sample of people using shared space and was designed to provide a snapshot of views in a variety of settings. Of the  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>55 people interviewed, eight were disabled, one of whom had a visual impairment. Six of the eight were unaccompanied, including the person with the visual disability. Incidentally, across the sample, participants tended to be either in favour of shared-space schemes or broadly neutral. The noble Lord, Lord Low, commented on the fact that only eight people were disabled. However, I respectfully point out to him that eight out of 55 broadly matches the proportion of disabled people in the national population.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000173"></a>We are aware that Guide Dogs enlisted the support of a number of organisations in its call for a ban on shared surfaces. However, there is a considerable amount of duplication of interest among these signatories and many represent the needs of visually impaired people. We do not complain about that but it is necessary that that is understood. It is also interesting to note that a number of the other charities listed represent the interests of certain disabled people who, it was found during the appraisal, welcomed the ability to travel through a step-free environment, and wheelchair users were a notable example.</p>

<p><a name="100203117000174"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100203117000283"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I am listening to the noble Lord with extreme care and he is obviously doing his best to reply to the debate. However, does he think that Guide Dogs has invented its fears? Does he think that it is doing this simply in order to give its public relations people something to do?</p>

<p><a name="100203117000175"></a><b><a name="100203-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100203117000284"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> Of course not, my Lords. I do not say that for one moment. It is a highly respected and very valuable organisation. However, we take the view that its point of view is not shared by disabled groups generally and that the fears it is expressing about shared spaces are, in the main, unjustified. If the noble Lord will allow me, I shall continue and perhaps give him some comfort in what I say in a moment.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000176"></a>Until now, I have spoken about safety by referring mainly to statistical evidence. However, safety is not just about statistics; people need to feel safe to be comfortable in these environments. Perception of safety may not be a reliable indicator of actual risk but it is important and can have a significant impact on people's lives. We do not intend to ignore this.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000177"></a>The main output from our research project will be comprehensive guidance on the design and provision of shared space. A major strand of this will be devoted to the provision of travel training for disabled people, including visually impaired people, and older people who may lack the confidence to make journeys outside unaccompanied. Such training will benefit people in areas without shared spaces, so our guidance will cover conventional streets too.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000178"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Low, Lord Crisp and Lord Jenkin, asked whether we will require local authorities to refrain from implementing shared-surface schemes until the research concludes. It is difficult to see how a ban on shared surfaces could be justified in the light of what I have said about safety and about the way that we intend to address the issues. To discourage their introduction would be to deny people the advantages. The noble Lord, Lord Best, in his very welcome  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduction, referred to some of those advantages and, indeed, particularly mentioned his own knowledge of the Netherlands.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000179"></a>The appraisal report on shared space concluded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100203117000197"></a>"It is clear that in certain situations, Shared Space schemes using level surfaces deliver practical benefits over those with kerbs".</p>

<p><a name="100203117000193"></a>It seems highly unlikely that the report's main conclusions, which I have quoted today, will change materially between now and completion of this work. Indeed, the appraisal report essentially represents the research conclusions for this project and gives all of us a clear steer on the way forward with shared space. However, should additional evidence come to light as work progresses that suggests that our current approach needs to be amended or even reversed, we will of course take that into account and act accordingly. I am happy to give the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Jenkin of Roding, that commitment today.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000180"></a>Designing public places almost inevitably involves accommodating conflicting aims to ensure that schemes reflect a reasonable balance of the needs of all users. While shared space appears to work well for most people, we understand how it can cause difficulties for some.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000181"></a>I should refer to the stance taken by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. It issued a statement on shared space last month that welcomed the programme of work being undertaken by the department, and expressed its commitment to work with us. I should mention that the DPTAC representative is himself visually disabled.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000182"></a>It is worth noting that shared space is not new. Shared surfaces have been used in residential areas for many years. Exeter High Street, for example, was redesigned as a shared space around 30 years ago, and many rural settlements, medieval villages and historic streets throughout the UK have always had a shared surface. I am drawing attention to the fact that shared space has been around for some time to show how use of the technique long predates the relatively recent  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>claims that it presents a danger to so many people. Honestly, if shared space really were as perilous as has been claimed, we would have been aware of a problem decades ago.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000183"></a>I shall comment on one or two of the points that were made which I have not already referred to. The noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to tactile paving. Research from Transport for London shows that the 800-millimetre-wide corduroy pattern is effective, but tactile paving is not always necessary; it is largely absent in home zones, for example. Still, we consider that our tactile paving guidance is not perfect-we admit that-and it could benefit from simplification. We would like to look at that in future.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000184"></a>The issue of kerbs, to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred in particular, is a tricky one. Guide Dogs insists that kerbs are essential, but we would like the organisation to accept that there are other ways for visually impaired people to navigate, such as building lines and street furniture. That is something that our guidance will look into, and if it is necessary to change the guidance then we will do so.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000185"></a>The Government have no preference for shared space over conventional layouts, but we have a desire to ensure that the technique remains available as an option for designers who are looking to improve public spaces. We understand why visually impaired people and others can find shared-space schemes, especially those with shared surfaces, intimidating. I am willing, provided that it is not turned into a PR gimmick, to undertake the challenge that the noble Earl put to me, on the understanding that he comes with me and takes part at the same time as I do.</p>

<a name="100203-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100203117000186"></a>Our intention is to overcome these concerns through promoting good practice in design and provision. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Low, and all other noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate that our priority is to assist all disabled people, and that our research is heavily geared towards their needs and doing the very best that we can for them.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="10020372000003"></a><b><a name="100203-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10020372000085"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10020372000004"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government have now finalised terms for reform of the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (CSCS) and that we have agreed these terms with the FDA, Prospect, the GMB, Unite and the Prison Officers' Association.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10020372000005"></a>The CSCS sets out the terms which departments may use on redundancy or voluntary exits. In reforming the scheme, we have a number of objectives:</p>
 first, we wish to be certain that the scheme represents value for money for the taxpayer-and delivers the £500 million saving set out by the Prime Minister in his Written Ministerial Statement of 31 March 2009;secondly, we need to ensure that the scheme both does not create perverse incentives, through awarding excessively generous payments to some individuals on redundancy and complies with age discrimination legislation, by ensuring that the level of severance payments awarded is primarily linked to length of service, not to age; andthirdly, we need to ensure the reforms provide additional protection to the lowest paid staff. 
<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10020372000006"></a>Cabinet Office officials have held numerous meetings with the Civil Service unions since July 2008. We consulted fully on the provisional proposals that the Cabinet Office published in <I>Fairness For All</I>, on 31 July 2009, receiving over 18,000 comments in response. I met with the Civil Service unions on 22 September as part of that process.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10020372000007"></a>In our response to the consultation, on 4 December 2009 we modified our original proposals to reflect the comments we had received. There were two issues that came through particularly strongly in the responses to the consultation and in my meeting with the unions. These were the need to ensure that the lowest paid workers with long service could still access up to three years' pay in compensation on redundancy, and the need to preserve the option of access to an unreduced pension on redundancy for those close to pension age.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10020372000008"></a>I met with the unions again on 17 December to discuss our revised proposals. I asked Cabinet Office officials to have further meetings with the unions in order to see if it were possible to reach agreement within the parameters of the principles that have been established.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10020372000009"></a>Following these discussions I am pleased that we have reached agreement with five of the six main Civil Service unions on a modified set of proposals. Unite, the GMB, Prospect, the Prison Officers' Association, and the FDA have agreed that these terms represent a fair deal for their members. Together these five unions  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS10"></a><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column WS10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>represent a cross section of Civil Service staff, across all grades, ages and professions. The sixth and largest union PCS has not agreed the terms, but its members, along with all other civil servants, will be subject to the settlement with the implementation of the amending order.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10020372000010"></a>The new terms provide added protection enabling the lowest paid to continue to receive a service-related redundancy payment of up to three years' pay, up to a maximum of £60,000. As in our earlier proposals, payments will be capped at a maximum of two years' pay for higher earners. The added protection for the lowest paid means that those earning under £20,000 will not be affected by the new cap limiting severance payments to two years' pay, while those earning between £20,000 and £30,000 will eligible for severance payments of up to between two and three years' pay.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10020372000011"></a>We have also agreed some further transitional protection for existing staff. If made compulsorily redundant, staff aged at least 50 as of 31 March 2010 (and with a minimum of five years' service) will continue to receive existing compulsory retirement terms. This means they will continue to receive an early, enhanced pension based on their years of service as at 31 March 2010, thus providing a significant level of further protection for those closest to retirement from the position reached in December.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10020372000012"></a>A relatively small number of civil servants, who joined the Civil Service before 1987, are currently eligible for a "reserved right" severance payment. Here we have modified our earlier proposals so that if made compulsorily redundant, these staff would receive a severance payment based on their years of service as at 31 March 2010 (with the cash value tapered to become equivalent in value to the new terms within three to four years).</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10020372000013"></a>We consider that the package of changes addresses concerns raised in the consultation and provides a fair deal both for civil servants and to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10020372000014"></a>I will lay the scheme amendments before Parliament by the end of this week, so as to implement the changes to the CSCS from 1 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10020372000016"></a>It has been necessary to conduct a detailed exercise in order to obtain the information to answer this Question. I had anticipated that I would be in a position to provide this information by the end of last year and I apologise for the delay in responding. However this exercise has now been completed and I am pleased to be able to respond to Lord Patten's request. Provisions contained within the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which received Royal Assent on the final day of the fourth Session, have not been considered as part of this exercise.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10020372000017"></a>Other than the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,  19 Acts containing criminal justice provisions have been enacted since 1997 for which the Ministry of Justice has responsibility, either in full or in part. Of these 19 Acts of Parliament, 68 of the sections for which the Ministry of Justice has policy responsibility currently remain unimplemented, either in full or in part and 25 of the schedules to these Acts are yet to be commenced in full or in part. A full list of provisions is contained within the table below.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10020372000018"></a>Of the unimplemented provisions, many are minor, consequential or transitional provisions, for example all of the unimplemented paragraphs in schedule 7 to the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000. Of the remaining unimplemented provisions there are valid reasons for the delay as is illustrated by the examples set out below:</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10020372000019"></a>The majority of unimplemented provisions are contained within the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and relate to sentencing policy including the legal framework for custody plus (Sections 181 and 188 and linked provisions in Sections 280-283 and schedules 10, 11, 26 and 27)-a sentence which allows an offender to serve both a short custodial sentence and then be supervised in the community afterwards. Resource constraints have meant that we have been unable thus far to implement custody plus and there is no prospect of doing so in the near future. However we are keen to explore options to support offenders released from short-term custody. There is already provision for resettlement for offenders released after short custodial sentences, notably through the Home Office's drugs interventions programme partnership with prison teams, and other locally supported schemes.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10020372000020"></a>The majority of the unimplemented provisions contained within the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 relate to the appointment of a Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses. A recruitment campaign conducted in 2006 failed to identify a suitable candidate for this role. Changes were made in the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to reshape the role of the commissioner, reflecting developments in the provision of support and services to victims and witnesses since the 2004 legislation. The Coroners and Justice Act recently received Royal Assent on 12 November and we have now launched the recruitment for a victims' commissioner for which the 2004 Act provisions as amended will be commenced. We intend to commence the provisions in early February and aim to make an appointment soon after.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10020372000021"></a>Section 10 of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 provides for courts to impose a publicity order, requiring the organisation to publicise details of its conviction and fine. As publicity orders are an entirely new disposal, commencement has been delayed until supporting guidelines are available for the courts. The Sentencing Guidelines Council published a consultation guideline on 27 October 2009 and a definitive guideline is likely to be ready early this year.</p>

This directive requires us to apply the offence to domestically established electronic service providers when they provide their services in other European economic area states. The necessary legislative changes to give us the powers we need in this respect were made by Section 143 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. That section came into force on Royal Assent. We will therefore proceed to implement the offence as soon as regulations are made to ensure that we meet the requirements of the directive.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10020372000023"></a>A further example relates to Section 39 of, and Schedule 7 to, the 2008 Act which introduce youth default orders which will enable a court to impose an unpaid work requirement on a young offender (of the age of 16 or 17), a curfew requirement or an attendance centre requirement in lieu of an unpaid fine. These provisions are yet to be implemented due to resource constraints.</p>

<a name="10020372000046"></a><b><a name="100203-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="10020372000087"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> The UK is committed to a massive expansion of renewable energy and a thriving, bioenergy industry is key to our goals. Indeed, bioenergy could supply up to half of our renewable energy needs by 2020-for heat, electricity and transport. Used wisely, energy from biomass will reduce CO2 emissions, make our energy supplies more secure, and create new industries and green jobs.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="10020372000047"></a>Biomass offers wider gains too. Over the next decade it can replace petrochemicals as the source of chemicals and other high-value products, as well as energy. Increasingly, the fuel for the new bioeconomy will be waste materials, including municipal waste diverted from landfill.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="10020372000048"></a>Biomass supplies will need to increase significantly to deliver the step change we want and in the short term at least we will be reliant on imports. It is essential that those supplies are sustainable. The Government are determined to ensure that biomass, whether imported or produced in the UK:</p>
delivers real and substantive CO2 savings;uses land responsibly avoiding damaging land use change; anddoes not undermine global food supplies or inflate prices.
<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="10020372000049"></a>We are working hard for global sustainability standards on this basis; and we will ensure that these principles are applied to biomass used to generate energy in the UK. We will implement the sustainability criteria set within the renewable energy directive for biofuels  and bioliquids and are pushing for early resolution within the EU of how to deal with indirect land use change effects.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="10020372000050"></a>With sensible, robust controls in place, the UK has a lot to gain from biomass energy. I am informed by industry that it expects to be able to deliver 5GW of dedicated biomass, energy from waste, gasification and anaerobic digestion projects over the next few years-some £13 billion worth of investment. And industry wishes to ensure that developers have a stable regime in which to invest.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="10020372000051"></a>To help achieve this, I propose to look again at one aspect of support for biomass electricity under the renewables obligation. With most technologies our policy is not, as a rule, to change the level of ROC support once a generating station is accredited by Ofgem, i.e. support is "grandfathered". This is not currently the case for biomass. I am aware our current policy not to grandfather the support given for biomass electricity under the renewables obligation has caused significant investment concerns within the industry. We made the decision not to grandfather biomass in 2008 due to the fact that unlike other technologies supported by the renewables obligation, biomass electricity generation faces ongoing fuel costs which are subject to market fluctuation in an immature market. We recognised the need for flexibility to consider the impact on biomass prices when setting the banding levels, and that led to increased support for all biomass generators, not just new entrants, on the introduction of banding as a result. In fact, we doubled support for AD and dedicated biomass with CHP.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="10020372000052"></a>The feed-in-tariffs for small-scale electricity, announced on 1 February, include tariffs for anaerobic digestion of 11.5p per kw/h up to 500kW and 9p per kw/h between 500kW and 5MW. These tariffs are grandfathered, index-linked and will be available to generators accrediting at least until 2013. From 1 April this year, AD generators which need the security of a fixed rate for electricity they generate will be able to choose to join the feed-in-tariff scheme rather than the renewables obligation. Given the risk that investment will not come forward, DECC will review the policy on grandfathering and prepare a statement before the end of March. This review will also consider what action the UK can take to introduce sustainability standards, following publication of the European Commission's report on biomass expected this February.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="10020372000055"></a>The Government want to see a private rented sector which offers high-quality accommodation, and in which tenants can make choices based on clear information about their options, their rights, and their responsibilities. We also want to ensure tenants know where to turn if things go wrong. At the same time, Government want to increase professionalism in the private rented sector-supporting good landlords and agents, while driving out the worst practices of the sector that fail tenants and damage its reputation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="10020372000056"></a>Alongside our longer-term plans for legislation to improve standards, today's document sets out our proposals to provide better help and support to tenants now.

<a name="100203-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="10020372000057"></a>Our consultation document, published in May 2008, set out a range of proposals to support a higher quality, more professional sector, while minimising the regulatory burden on good landlords and agents. The proposals included a national register of landlords for England; full regulation for private sector letting and managing agents; and encouragement to local authorities to create local lettings agencies.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="10020372000058"></a>Consultation responses were strongly supportive of the proposals, although there were some concerns about specific details, and about implementation.

In particular the statement includes commitments to:</p>
establish a national register of landlords, to protect tenants and support local authority enforcement activity. We will carry out further detailed work with stakeholders to assess whether the register could also be used (either from the outset, or in  the future) to apply registration conditions on persistently poor landlords; introduce full regulation of letting and managing agents. We will carry out further detailed work with stakeholders on the exact form of regulation, and whether it is led by an independent regulator, or by industry bodies; require all tenancies to take the form of a written agreement; andincrease the limit for assured shorthold tenancies from £25,000 a year to £100,000.

Having taken into account the strong representations we received from interested parties, we will no longer be proceeding with some of the changes proposed, and others have been modified in response to stakeholder concerns. We intend to make a number of changes to civil legal aid to:</p>
 improve the way that cases involving human rights or public interest are handled by transferring cases that depend on these issues to receive funding to a new committee for advice on their merits. This will help to ensure that legal aid is awarded to meritorious cases; ensure that cases granted legal aid on the basis that the proceedings will bring benefits to others have a realistic prospect of delivering such wider benefits;detect fraudulent legal aid applications earlier, by checking with the unfunded opponent to ensure that the applicant is financially eligible for legal aid, with safeguards for domestic violence or urgent cases;tighten the funding rules for granting legal aid for judicial review cases to ensure that funding is directed towards meritorious cases;restrict funding for low-value damages claims brought as part of a multi-party action. This will help to ensure that limited resources are available for higher-value cases, or cases brought by individuals;

<a name="100203-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="10020372000074"></a>Today I am laying before Parliament the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2010. This order will continue in force the temporary provisions regarding the appointment of police officers and police support staff for a further, final year to 28 March 2011.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="10020372000075"></a>A further one-year renewal will enable the Government to reach their target of 30 per cent Catholic representation in PSNI by March 2011. This is in line with the commitment made in the St Andrews agreement that the 50:50 recruitment arrangements to the PSNI will lapse when the Patten target for Catholic officers has been achieved. It is our intention, if the 30 per cent target is reached before March 2011, to return to Parliament to lapse the provisions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="10020372000076"></a>Before deciding to renew the provisions, we have carefully considered the responses we received to a full 12-week review of the effectiveness of the temporary provisions. This review formed part of the Secretary of State's statutory duty to have regard to progress made towards ensuring that membership of the police and police support staff is representative of the community in Northern Ireland, and to consult the Policing Board. The consultation ended on 22 January 2010.</p>

<a name="100203-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="10020372000077"></a>Since the introduction of the temporary provisions in 2001, Catholic composition has risen from 8.3 per cent to 27.68 per cent. This represents substantial progress towards a more representative police service. There is, however, still a short distance to go before the target of 30 per cent Catholic representation is achieved. For these reasons, and after looking carefully at the responses to the consultation, the Secretary of State has decided that the temporary provisions should be renewed for a further year to 28 March 2011.</p>

This would mostly apply to around 10 per cent of the retired Gurkha community, largely officers, where there is a more significant difference between the Gurkha Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. In the majority of cases Gurkhas receive at least equivalent value from their pensions, due to the early age at which they can begin receiving payments, compared to those on Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75, or its predecessor.</p>

The original procedure advised by HKID was for 4B applicants to apply for an Hong Kong special administrative region passport. If these applicants had not registered or naturalised as Chinese citizens, nor had an automatic claim to Chinese citizenship, their application would be rejected and they would be issued with a full refund for the passport fee. The rejection letter would serve as documentary evidence in their application for registration as a British citizen under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. After four days of using this procedure, HKID requested that it be changed. Both sides agreed to simplify the process, with the BCG liaising directly with HKID to verify whether 4B applicants had registered or naturalised, or whether they had an automatic claim to Chinese citizenship.</p>

The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) will not be buying licences to enable the playing of music in prisons. Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 1/2010 (available in the Library of the House) instructs prisons that music must not be played in staff offices, rest rooms, canteens, prisoner work places and prisoner recreational areas from 25 January 2010. Licences are not required for the playing of music in prisoner residential areas, for educational purposes and for religious worship.</p>
