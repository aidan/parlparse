<a name="60314-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Stern </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>How they are planning to respond to the report of the independent inquiry chaired by the Lord Carlile of Berriew into physical restraint, forcible strip searching and solitary confinement of children in custody.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, I am meeting the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, on 29 March to discuss his report. The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board are looking at the recommendations in the report. We will announce in due course any action that we propose to take in relation to them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Stern: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. Does she agree that the account in the report by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, of thousands of unjustifiable strip searches of children who may be as young as 12 and the subduing of children through the use of pain, which can lead to injury and permanent damage to young bones, suggests that action is needed? Does she now accept the report&#039;s recommendation that the time has come for her responsibility for children in custody to be moved from the Home Office to the Minister for Children?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I acknowledge what the noble Baroness says about the difficulties that have been identified. Strip searching can, on occasion, be necessary. Of course, it is important for those occasions to be limited and for the procedure to be appropriately undertaken.
</p>

<a name="60314-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Pain-compliant means of control are strictly regulated. I assure the noble Baroness that we have put in place a code that is monitored regularly to ensure that the implementation is as we would all wish it to be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to discuss these matters in perhaps a slightly more intimate setting than this Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60314-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Does the Minister accept that the purpose of the report that I produced on behalf of the Howard League was not to criticise anybody at all but to assist government and others to move policy forward? Does she also accept that perhaps the most crucial thing about the report is that it seeks to identify children in custody as children rather than as prisoners?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I understand that that is the thrust of the noble Lord&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1094"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1094</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report. Indeed, I hope that I have indicated that we welcome the report as a contribution to an important debate on the treatment of young people in custody. The noble Lord will know that one of the challenges is that we have some very damaged and disturbed young people, who have, in turn, become very damaging to others. For instance, we currently have in custody more than 50 young people accused of murder. They are damaged young people, and we must do absolutely everything in our power to ensure that they receive the care that they need as children and that the risks that they present are better managed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister assure us that all those employed to take care of children in custody get the extra, special and sensitive training and retraining that they need, above the standard training that prison officers receive?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend and emphasise how important we think training is. The Youth Justice Board has been rigorous in the way in which it has approached the issue. The monitoring about which I have spoken in relation to the code of practice on behaviour management, which was issued on 6 February, will involve scrutiny of the implementation of that code and, indeed, the training needs that might come about as a result of it. There is a lot of work to do. We have done a lot, but much more needs to be done to improve the system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister include in her meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, the question of whether, on the basis of prima facie evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service is doing an effective job in prosecuting staff who are believed to have assaulted children?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I can certainly assure the noble Viscount that we are doing all that we can to ensure that the criminal justice system works more effectively and that prosecutors have specialisation. Noble Lords will know that we have a number of specialist prosecutors in the area of domestic violence and children and that the prosecutors code, which has recently been promulgated, is obviously very important. I absolutely guarantee to noble Lords that we are looking at that issue in relation not only to this area but to many others.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Ramsbotham: </b>   My Lords, being a member of the inquiry chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, brought it home to me, if it needed bringing home, that, tragically, such inquiries and the work of the independent inspectorate of prisons are the only organisations that bring to the notice of the public the disgraceful treatment of those in custody. I am sure that the Minister will agree that compromise inevitably weakens the power of individual organisations. In view of that, does she think it sensible that rather than merely postponing the emasculation <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1095"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1095</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of power of the independent inspectorate&#151;the one organisation that can inform her on the treatment and conditions of those for whom she is responsible, including children&#151;it might be more sensible to cancel its merger into the compromise that is the proposed inspectorate of justice, community safety and custody?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree that that is right. We have had a number of debates&#151;I am sure that we shall have more&#151;about the way in which we seek to safeguard the function that is currently undertaken by a number of inspectors. That work will continue. Our purpose is to strengthen and better inform the system so that we can do better for those for whom we care.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for her generous response to the report. Although uniquely difficult youngsters are involved, we do not have the policy right yet, so I hope that she will read the report carefully and consider our whole strategy towards young people who are difficult to handle and who have to be placed in some sort of custodial or restraint situation. We do not have it right, and we need to rethink the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I assure my noble friend that that is precisely what we are doing. The code of practice is part of an ongoing review. The way in which we are monitoring it will enable us to change the system as and when the facts demonstrate that that is the right way to go.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, how do the findings of my noble friend Lord Carlile line up with the Government&#039;s obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and of Article 37 in particular? Will the Minister note that my noble friend Lord Carlile said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The rule of law and protection of human rights should apply to all children equally, regardless of whether they are detained in custody or in the community&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I can assure the noble Baroness that they do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, anybody listening to the exchange between the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Corbett of Castle Vale, and who has had the task of raising children through the teenage years will realise that there needs to be a change in emphasis in the training of officers. Is it the case at present that the people detaining children are trained primarily as prison officers but take an additional course, as the noble Lord suggested, to bring them up to standard for caring for children? If so, would it not be better that they should be taught the difficult art of raising rebellious teenage children, many of whom will have been subject to abuse, and subsequently given the skills needed to become prison officers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60314-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, those skills are often combined. We appreciate that there are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1096"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1096</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

training needs. They are being addressed, and I assure noble Lords that those matters are certainly at the forefront of my mind.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60314-02_time0"></a><h5>2.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Sheldon </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Why so few royal commissions have been appointed during the past 10 years.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  My Lords, royal commissions are one of a number of ways used by government of informing and developing policy. We will continue to use them where appropriate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that in the post-war years up to 1980 there were nine royal commissions in every decade? In the 1980s there were none; since then there have been three. As royal commissions are a very thorough way of examining major areas of public concern, should we not return to using them? In 1951, there was a royal commission on the taxation of profits and income. In view of the current complications in the tax system, should we not now consider a similar royal commission?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I was aware of the broad statistics on royal commissions. The noble Lord is right; although they were used a lot immediately post-war, they were hardly used between 1979 and 1997. They have been used twice since 1997. Some things are very suitable for a royal commission. Some of the things that they have been used for&#151;examining spontaneous combustion in ships in 1875, or, in 1884, housing of the working classes, on which the Prince of Wales was a commissioner&#151;look sensible. The Royal Commission on Royal Commissions in 1919 seems sensible. I do not agree that a royal commission on the tax system is a good idea.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that the Government might have saved themselves a load of trouble if they had followed the 1960s precedent and had a royal commission on police force mergers? Am I not right that the HMIC report that proposed the mergers did not advocate a timetable remotely like that adopted by the Secretary of State? All the rush has meant not only wholly inadequate consultation but, in the north-east, proposals that the chairman of the police committee described as exactly the opposite of what local people wanted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, the question of police mergers is rather far away from that of royal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1097"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1097</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commissions. The sense of uncertainty that a royal commission on police mergers would produce would be very bad for the criminal justice system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord think that it would be appropriate&#151;to use his word&#151;to set up a royal commission to have a systematic and considered look at the role, functions and composition of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I know that the noble Lord is very keen on royal commissions. He said that we should have a royal commission on the constitution in the debate on the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, on the West Lothian question. However, he will remember that the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, produced a most excellent report. Sadly, so far it has not yet produced reform of our House. I do not know what conclusion you draw from that. Is that a good or a bad thing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I was impressed by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#039;s historical reading. It confirms that Liberal governments have a very good record.
</p>

<a name="60314-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Did the noble and learned Lord read last night the stark warnings by Mr Rupert Murdoch that technology changes would have a catastrophic effect on the media industry and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;build and destroy not just companies but whole countries&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>It is 30 years since our last royal commission on the press. Isn&#039;t it time for another one?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I did not read Rupert Murdoch&#039;s remarks on the threat to the press. We have had three royal commissions on the press&#151;1947, 1961 and 1974&#151;and what on earth has the effect of those been on the press?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   My Lords, I was the last Minister to appoint a royal commission, as Home Secretary. It came up with excellent proposals on the right to silence and miscarriages of justice. However, it reported several years after I was Home Secretary, and I was able to take no credit for it, which was a great disappointment.
</p>

<a name="60314-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>As Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, will the noble and learned Lord resist the temptation to have a royal commission on the constitution? I know that he is playing around with the concept of an English parliament&#151;rather badly, I may say&#151;but will he resist that temptation? All the recommendations of royal commissions on the constitution have never been implemented.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord on his royal commission, which, as he says, produced considerable results. It is a great personal tragedy for him that he never got the credit <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1098</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that he deserved for it. I also feel strengthened by the fact that he says, &quot;Don&#039;t appoint a royal commission on the constitution&quot;? I could not agree more.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Corston: </b>   My Lords, may I invite my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to consider that Harold Wilson had the answer to the question when he said that royal commissions took minutes but wasted years?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, some people would say that; I could not possibly comment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   My Lords, can the noble and learned Lord assure us, bearing in mind how long we have been waiting for the Civil Service Bill, that he has not set up a royal commission on that Bill and that it is considering matters in secret?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, there is no such royal commission, although there was a royal commission on the Civil Service in 1912.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, can the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor take the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, rather more seriously? As the Chancellor has doubled the size of the tax code in numbers of pages and as there is increasing irritation about the complexity of the tax system and its effect on our competitiveness, surely a royal commission would be ideally suited to look at that matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I indicated that I did not think that it would&#151;the idea that a royal commission lasting over a year should look at the whole tax system does not seem to deal with the fact that the tax system is here and now, and how it is changed is as much a matter of politics as anything else.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, as has been said, royal commissions are ineffective. Does the noble and learned Lord&#039;s excellent brief indicate how long they have taken and how much they cost?

<a name="60314-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, unfortunately, my excellent brief does not indicate how long they took or how much they cost. I imagine that that would vary from royal commission to royal commission.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60314-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. In his Oxford speech some weeks ago, the Prime Minister said two things that were highly relevant to the convention: first, that it had been a mistake that Britain had so often left joining new European initiatives until long after they had been shaped; and secondly, that internal security was one of Britain&#039;s highest priorities in the European Union. Bearing that in mind, do the Government not think that they ought to treat the matter with some urgency? Given that this is popularly described as Schengen III, would it be possible for Britain to join the Pr&#252;m convention without also signing up to the Schengen convention?

<a name="60314-03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I assure the noble Lord that we are taking the issue seriously and are giving it the attention that it deserves. In relation to the way in which the Government have reacted to developments in Europe, I hope that noble Lords have seen great energy and engagement right across the field. It is right that we currently have no intention to change our position on Schengen.

<a name="60314-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, as the current chairman of Sub-Committee F of the European Union Committee, which has studied the issue both under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, in the past and under mine, may I endorse the sentiment behind his Question? Is the Minister aware that, in the context of considering the draft framework decision on the exchange of information under the principle of availability, her colleague, Mr. Paul Goggins, wrote to my noble friend Lord Grenfell on 9 January to say that he anticipated that negotiation on the Framework Decision would be informed by the Pr&#252;m treaty? Can the Minister say whether the subsequent course of negotiation has made the Government any readier to consider accession to the treaty?

He will know that the Pr&#252;m convention contains a number of issues, with some of which we readily agree and would actively seek to implement. Others, as the noble Lord will know, are far more challenging and need greater scrutiny and care.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, during the passage of the Identity Cards Bill, we have had the opportunity to discuss precisely how information will be shared, especially bearing in mind that we have made it absolutely clear that the information on the database will be kept secure at all times and that our ordinary arrangements for requests from other jurisdictions will be applied.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, our non-formal membership of Schengen means that the extent of British engagement with the Schengen information system, the visa information system, Eurodat and various other European-wide databases is not entirely easy to discover. Will the Government commit to providing a report to both Houses of Parliament on the terms and conditions under which the United Kingdom Government now share information under a convention with which we are partly associated but of which we are not a full member?

<a name="60314-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, the conflicts in Darfur and Chad have caused thousands of deaths and left millions homeless. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1101"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We are working to end the conflict in Darfur through our support for the peace talks in Abuja. We are seeking to assist the displaced through our support for the humanitarian programme, and we are helping to protect civilians through our support for the AU mission and its early handover to a United Nations force. We are also pressing Chad and Sudan to end their proxy war and to honour the peace deal that they signed in Libya last month. We will continue to work actively for lasting peace in the region, and we are encouraging all our African and international partners to do likewise.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply, which comes in what the United States has termed Genocide Awareness Week. Can the noble Lord put a figure on the total loss of life that has occurred during the past three years of fighting? Is it correct to say that 4,000 people are still dying every month and that a considerable number of villages have been burnt down in Chad? Does he agree that the Government of the Sudan have not only failed to protect their own people but have attacked or allowed attacks on their neighbour? Does that not show that effective international default action is now necessary?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the situation in Darfur is abhorrent: 1.8 million people are in displaced camps and unable to return home, and 1.5 million more vulnerable people are outside camps and need protection. Estimated deaths are in a range between 70,000 and 400,000, but the truth is that no one knows&#151;I suspect that no one will ever know&#151;so I cannot comment on the figure of 4,000 per month. That certainly indicates that we must all redouble our efforts relating to the Abuja talks; we must ensure that AMIS is as successful as it can be; and we must try to encourage warring parties on both sides of what is an extremely porous border to desist from attacking each other.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, President Omar al-Bashir told reporters menacingly that Darfur would be a graveyard for UN troops in the light of the failure of the African Union in not handing over to the UN until September. What is the Government&#039;s response?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, regrettably, blood-curdling statements are frequently made by members of the Government of Sudan, by rebel groups there, by the Janjaweed and by everybody else. The art of speaking peacefully seems to be long dead in that region. The reality is that a UN force cannot step up to the mark unless it is fully prepared; the period that has been referred to is the time that will be taken to prepare it. In the mean time, it is critical that the AMIS force succeeds. I have to say that despite grave difficulties the AMIS force has successes to its name. The number of deaths in the areas that it can patrol has decreased, as has the incidence of rapes and assaults on the population. However, this is still a desperately <br>&nbsp;<br>

dangerous mission, and in the long run in my judgment the United Nations is the only way in which it can be resolved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there has been a dramatic escalation in the scale of attacks on civilians since the beginning of the year and that the Janjaweed has crossed the border into Chad, supported by the Government of Sudan? Bearing in mind the hope that has been expressed by the UN Secretary-General that, pending the transfer of responsibility to the UN, measures will be taken to increase the support for the AU, as the Minister just said, will the Government propose that UN close air support be provided to the AU forces, together with the ground troops necessary for their protection, so that they can operate under AMIS command against the militias that are causing such grievous depredations?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60314-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the offer of air support has been made to the African Union in the past and, for reasons of judgment and of military necessity, the AU has declined to accept it. Surveillance from the air has also been offered and rejected. The AU is making the judgments on the ground. These are difficult judgments. We will give support by increasing the number of battlefield planners, observers and others&#151;we can certainly do that to bolster the mission. However, I repeat&#151;I hope that I am not irritating the House in doing so&#151;that many of the tribal peoples who are warring backwards and forwards across what is not very realistically called the border have always crossed that border. The tribal divisions did not know of those borders, and they do not respect them now.

<a name="60314-04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, is the main problem lack of money?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   No, my Lords, the financial requirements of the AMIS forces have been met. This country has been the largest donor to that exercise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise the disturbing escalation, to which my noble friend Lord Avebury referred, and gradual extension of the battles and combat into Chad itself? Given that Chad is an associated member of the European Union, would it be possible to ensure more effective policing of that, I agree, rather hypothetical border, so that at least the refugee camps and the groups of families from Darfur who have settled in Chad&#151;there are many thousands, as the Minister will know&#151;could be protected and not sucked into the dreadful genocide going on in Sudan?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree completely that that would be desirable, but I do not think that a line of soldiers would achieve that result. In discussions on 21 and 23 February, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development put to the Government of Sudan the very issues that the noble Baroness has just put to me. On 3 February, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1103"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I also raised them with the Sudanese Foreign Minister. We have also put &#163;5 million towards work in Chad on the issues of security and humanitarian response, which we pursue through the permanent representative at the United Nations. We have to disengage these forces. We need a comprehensive peace plan comparable to that between the north and the south, which has restored a degree of peace at least in the south of Sudan. There has to be a political as well as a security solution.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, the Minister said that only the UN can solve this problem. Surely one of the troubles is that the UN has a very limited mandate to help displaced persons internally. These are really second-class citizens; they are not receiving the same attention as the refugees on the other side of the border, as he rightly says. Should not the UN Security Council take this up and extend the mandate to internally displaced persons?
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, for the purposes of clarity, I should explain that the AMIS forces are operating under a mandate granted to them by the African Union itself, albeit approved by the UN. If African Union troops are to move to blue-hat status so that the UN is responsible for the entire operation&#151;the logistics, the planning and the protection of the humanitarian effort&#151;it is essential that a very crisp and clear mandate from the Security Council accompanies the work of that force, not least because we want the disarmament of the warring factions along the border and, indeed, deep inside Darfur.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rea: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister give a little background to the reason why the African Union force has declined logistic and air support? Will the United Nations force, which will supplant it, be able to receive that support? The six months or so before it takes over will be very dangerous, and I wonder whether it would suitable to suggest to the African Union forces that they think again about receiving our logistical support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, no final decision has been taken on the UN. The African Union has agreed in principle, which I welcome, because it is a genuinely helpful step. The African Union has not been able to deploy its helicopters at all effectively, partly for logistic reasons&#151;often, the fuel has not been in the same place as the helicopters&#151;and sometimes because the Government of Sudan have denied flight plans until weeks after the event that the helicopters were supposed to pursue. These are all serious difficulties. If the UN mission is to be agreed&#151;I say &quot;if&quot; carefully, because the decision is still to be taken&#151;there must be absolute clarity about the logistics, the means of deployment and the mandate under which it operates. I believe that that will be a fundamental step forward, but I must say that that step has been made possible because, in the first of its really major deployments, the African Union has held the ring in what we all know to be a desperately dangerous place.

<a name="60314-04_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   My Lords, would it not be more sensible to take Clauses 10 to 83, along with their associated schedules, first, and then to take Clauses 1 to 9 and their associated schedule on the Floor of the House? After all, Clauses 1 to 9 and the associated schedule directly affect 25 per cent of this nation. That 25 per cent is a very large minority, which deserves the right to have those clauses debated in public on the Floor of the House, rather than shunted away in some Grand Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I support what the noble Lord has just said. I made the same point earlier, and asked the Government to reconsider their position. I hoped that they would do that through the usual channels. Was that request taken into account, and was there any discussion with the usual channels so that we could have a democratic debate on <br>&nbsp;<br>

Clauses 1 to 9, which, as the noble Lord has just said, remove the freedom that 25 per cent of the population have had for a very long time?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, we have discussed this issue previously. It was agreed by the usual channels that this Bill would go to a Grand Committee. It is usual practice that Bills should not be split. Of course, there will be adequate time for discussion of this Bill on Report on the Floor of the House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, the increasing tendency to send Bills to Grand Committee, whether or not agreed by the usual channels, combined with the tightening of the rule on Third Reading, means that the opportunity for a number of votes on a Bill is increasingly limited. It may be that there should be 10, 12 or 14 important votes and one cannot get all those in on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, I understand that there have been no practical changes to the usual procedures at Third Reading, and that the number of Bills going to Grand Committee every year has not changed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, some years ago usual procedure was changed when I wanted to have certain clauses&#151;I have forgotten the Bill&#151;debated on the Floor of the House. I was told by the Clerk of the Parliaments that it was too late and that the usual channels had made a decision, but that it could be raised at a later stage. I was told that the Standing Orders had been revised to make possible the sort of application made now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60314-04_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, as this debate has moved on rather from the order of consideration on the Health Bill, perhaps I may make a more general response. Obviously, all the procedures of the House are in the hands of the House. While we cannot betray the privacy of the usual channels, it is fair to say that there are discussions about the appropriate place to send virtually every Bill. Indeed, on virtually every Bill, there are one or two Members of the House, if not more, who think that it should be debated on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<a name="60314-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>There is no subterfuge on this; it is very simple arithmetic. We could accede to all requests for all Bills to be taken on the Floor of the House, but it would involve sitting on Christmas Day, for example. I get the feeling that that would not have the general approval of the House. It is the nature of the job for the usual channels to please some of the people some of the time. That is the best we can do. It is done in good faith. I am sorry if some people are sometimes upset by the decision. But, overall management of the House gives security to the dates of the Recesses, which is a universally popular move that has not disadvantaged either the Government or the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60314-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the Chief Whip will reflect on the fact that, not many years ago, when we had perfectly adequate Recesses and sat for reasonable lengths of time, we managed to get through the whole of government business without having a Grand Committee at all. This debate highlights the steadily increasing volume of legislation, if not in the number of Bills, in the length of Bills, which is going systematically wrong with the system of government in this country. Will the Chief Whip take this back to his friends in another place to consider whether we cannot manage our business more effectively?
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60314-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, with respect, perhaps I may suggest that the Chief Whip has somewhat missed the point. There may be very complicated Bills on which the House would like to have a large number of votes. There may be a case for taking most of the Bill in Grand Committee, but with a provision for important clauses to be taken on the Floor of the House in Committee. Would the noble Lord consider that or perhaps refer it to the Procedure Committee?
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60314-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   My Lords, I also make a plea to the Chief Whip: this is a genuine request. I am quite happy for the vast majority of the Bill to go to Grand Committee, but millions of people outside this House have strong feelings on Clauses 1 to 9. But one day&#151;I am willing to restrict it to one day&#151;on the Floor of the House does not seem to be asking too much for those of us who wish to put the minority view affecting, as I have already said, 25 per cent of the nation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60314-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, we do not know whether it is a minority or majority view in this House; we will have to wait and see. There are all sorts of possibilities, but this House has the opportunity to debate the matter on the Floor of the House on Report and at Third Reading. That is two opportunities, which is pretty reasonable.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>On the wider point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, I could bore the House rigid with the volume of legislation over the past 30 years if I had my notes with me, but I can assure him that there is no dramatic difference between the numbers of Bills introduced and Queens Speech during this Government in comparison with the figures for the previous 18 years under the Conservative government. Off the top of my head, there are between 31 and 33 Bills, of varying degrees of complexity. We could run through the contentiousness and complexity of Bills under the previous government but I do not think it would get us very far. Frankly, if there were anyone in the Chair this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1107"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1107</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discussion would be ruled grotesquely out of order already, as we are meant to be debating the Motion on the Health Bill. But I have trespassed and I am sure everyone else has as well.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>My noble friend Lord Taylor mentioned the politics of the House and what used to happen in the old days, with regard to the number of opposition parties and the size of the government party. I would put every Bill on to the Floor of the House if I could have a majority of about 200, which is what the previous administration had in this House. It does help a little but we must not trespass into the political arena.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I take very seriously the point about whether we could split Bills, with one part discussed on the Floor and another discussed in Grand Committee. First, the Procedure Committee has ruled against this; furthermore, it would add unbearably to the burden of the usual channels. The usual channels do not get a vast amount of sympathy here or anywhere else, but if, on every single Bill, in addition to the nightmare which we are experiencing of a debate about whether it should be in Grand Committee, we then had a debate on which part of the Bill should be in Grand Committee and which should not, some of us would really despair about how we could ever get the business organised through the House. I am sure that we are a good, friendly, self-governing House and we can move on to the next business.

<a name="60314-05_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith) </b>  moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 2, line 6, leave out &quot;by words or conduct&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 2. It has always been the Government&#039;s intention that the Clause 2 offence should apply to representations made to a machine just as it applies to representations made to a person. However, having reflected on the Bill since Committee, we have concluded that as the Bill stands, it is not entirely certain whether the Clause 2 offence would apply equally to representations made to a machine as it does to representations made to a person.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>In a letter that I wrote on 15 October of last year I set out how these amendments will clarify the offence to make sure that false representations made to machines would be a crime under the new general offence of fraud. It is clear&#151;and it is stated in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill&#151;that the Clause 2 offence extends to false representations posted on a website. Even if the representation is not read by another person, the information, once transferred to a website, is open to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1108"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1108</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be read and intended to be read by others. The position is not so clear for representations made to a machine, which in some cases may never be read by a person.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>In its report, the Law Commission notes that it is arguable whether there is a false representation if data are inputted into a machine even if there is no deception of a person. So there is potentially an element of uncertainty here. The commission was naturally very conscious of the problem of representations to machines, but its view was that the problem would be resolved by Clause 11 as it arises only in relation to services; they are not property and hence cannot be the subject of a theft charge.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The Clause 11 offence should indeed be used in cases where services have been dishonestly obtained, but on one reading of Clause 2 as it stands, the prosecution might need to rely on a charge of theft where property has been obtained by inputting data into a machine. We consider that it would be undesirable to differentiate between cases where property is obtained fraudulently by a representation made to a machine, which in practice operates on behalf of a person, and where the representation is made directly to a person. For example, we see no need to distinguish between a credit or debit card tendered to a machine in cases where the card is tendered to a person. Indeed, in many everyday situations it is a combination of the two and, increasingly, the sales assistant takes a back seat while the customer inputs the PIN into the card machine.
</p>

<a name="60314-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The Law Commission said that its new offence would apply even if the person to whom the card is tendered is indifferent as to whether the representation to him is false, but it may not always be clear in such cases whether the representation is actually made to an indifferent sales assistant or simply to the machine. For example, on occasions the sales assistant may not even look at the card as the card owner himself inserts the card into the machine and enters the PIN. The practical difference between a person misusing a credit card before a sales assistant indifferent as to whether a representation is false and a representation being made without the presence of any assistants seems to us to be negligible.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>We do not want law enforcers to face unreasonably technical choices in making charges and we consider therefore that the Bill should make it clear that a false representation should be an offence whether made to a machine or to a person. This is done by making amendments to provide expressly that representations may be implied and that a representation may be regarded as being made where it or anything implying it is submitted to any system or device, the aim being to clarify, for example, that the entering of a number into a chip-and-pin machine is a representation.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;ABOLITION OF OFFENCE OF CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD

<br>
   The common law offence of conspiracy to defraud is abolished.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_81"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment introduces into the Bill the abolition of the offence of conspiracy to defraud. In moving the amendment, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 5 to 16 inclusive. Of those, Amendments Nos. 7 to 16 are purely consequential and I shall not mention them further. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 create a sunrise clause which, for reasons I shall explain later, would delay the implementation of the abolition of the offence of conspiracy to defraud for a period of not less than three years.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Bill creates a number of new offences and for the first time makes fraud a statutory offence and defines it. Whenever there is a statutory offence, conspiracy to commit that offence is itself an offence&#151;and that is as true of the new offences in this Bill as it is of any other statutory offence. The amendment would not prevent the conviction of those charged with conspiracy to commit any of the statutory offences. It refers merely to the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. It is said that, as regards conspiracy to commit a statutory offence, there are procedural problems, but these are being reviewed by the Law Commission in its current work on the laws relating to participation in crime, and it is to be hoped that we will have its recommendations quite soon.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The offence of conspiracy to defraud is a common law offence, which means that it has been created by the decisions of judges and not by an Act of Parliament. It is an offence that is anomalous because defendants can be convicted of conspiracy to defraud even if what they have done would not be an offence at all if it was done by one person alone. The Law Commission, in its 1976 report, said emphatically:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;The object of a conspiracy should be limited to the commission of a substantive effect, and there should be no place in a criminal code for a law of conspiracy extending beyond this ambit. An agreement should not be criminal where that which it was agreed should be done would not amount to a criminal offence if committed by one person&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>In its latest report from 2002, which led to this Bill, the Law Commission said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;This Commission has repeated its adherence to this principle in subsequent reports and we believe it commands very wide support. Either conspiracy to defraud is too wide in its scope (in that it catches agreements to do things that are rightly not criminal), or the statutory offences are too narrow (in that they fail to catch certain conduct which should be criminal), or&#151;which is <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_1110"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>our view&#151;the problem is a combination of the two. On any view, the present position is anomalous and has no place in a coherent criminal law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Later in the 2002 report, the Law Commission said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;If it is thought that certain torts, breaches of contract or equitable wrongs should be criminal, legislation can be framed with reference to the particular kinds of conduct involved. To retain conspiracy to defraud on the grounds that it might occasionally prove useful in certain cases would, in our view, be an excess of caution. Since it is not practicable to identify all such cases in advance, it would mean that we could never be in a position to abolish conspiracy to defraud, unless we were willing to replace it with a general dishonesty offence, an option that we rejected in Part 5, above. The advantages of abolishing it, in our view, greatly outweigh any possible advantage that might accrue from retaining it alongside the new offences we recommend. We believe that those offences cover enough of the ground presently covered by conspiracy to defraud to make it unnecessary to retain that offence any longer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The offence of conspiracy to defraud may indeed have unexpected and unwelcome consequences. Let us take price fixing&#151;a business cartel&#151;as an example. Price fixing was not, I believe, an offence in the United Kingdom until 1998. However, the Americans have successfully argued in an extradition case that a price fixing agreement entered into before 1998 was a conspiracy to defraud in English law and therefore met the test of dual criminality necessary for extradition. This was totally unforeseen and shows the enormous degree of uncertainty that makes conspiracy to defraud an unsatisfactory offence. From the point of view of the prosecution, it may be that this very uncertainty makes it attractive, but this contravenes a basic principle: that the law&#151;in particular, the criminal law&#151;should be certain.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Until now there has been no statutory definition of fraud. We now have one in Clauses 1 to 4 of the Bill. That makes it plainly inappropriate to have an offence of conspiracy to defraud involving acts that do not amount to fraud under the statutory definition. It is possible that the courts might decide that it was no longer appropriate to charge people with common law conspiracy to defraud now that we have a statutory offence of fraud.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I am well aware that the views of the Law Commission have not met with unanimous approval. I have noted, in particular, the views of the Rose committee, chaired by Lord Justice Rose. I understand that and see that it has an arguable case. I believe that the Law Commission has made a convincing case for the abolition of the offence, but I would not object to a trial period to see whether the new offences are effective and whether there is still a need to make use of the common law offence.

<a name="60314-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The Government, indeed, have said that it is their aim to abolish the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud in the long term. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said in Committee that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;the Government commit to review the operation of the Act three years after its implementation&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/7/05; col. 1447.]</p>

</p>

<a name="60314-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I am certainly happy to accept the three years as being a reasonable trial period. Therefore, our Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would put on the face of the Bill a prohibition on bringing into force provisions which would abolish the offence of conspiracy to defraud within that three-year period. That does not, of course, mean that the provision will come into force at the end of that period; further time will be needed for review, for example. However, the inclusion of these provisions on the face of the Bill would, I believe, put some pressure on the Government&#151;which, by that time, may not be the present Government&#151;to proceed with a review soon after the three-year trial period has ended. It would also mean that if the review showed that the common law offence was not needed, provisions to abolish it could be brought into force by a simple commencement order. It would not be necessary to wait for an appropriate Bill and to tag these provisions on to it, which might take considerable time.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>If the review showed that the common law offence was still needed, the Government could simply leave the provisions uncommenced and repeal them at a suitable moment. Enacting these provisions again is unlikely to be a priority and, if they are taken out of the Bill, I believe that there is a real risk that they will be ignored by future governments and we will be left for the foreseeable future with an anomalous and uncertain offence. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60314-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I spoke on this matter, at inordinate length, during the Second Reading debate on 22 June 2005 and in Committee on 19 July 2005.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>As your Lordships are aware, under the offence of conspiracy to defraud, it can be a criminal offence for two people to agree to do something that would otherwise be lawful. That poses the following problem to our legal system. The jury&#039;s decision on dishonesty determines whether a particular set of facts is a crime. In more technical language, the decision on the <i>mens rea</i> of a crime in a court determines the constitution of the <i>actus reus</i> of a crime, so an activity can be made fraudulent simply because of the jury&#039;s decision on dishonesty.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The consequence of this is that it delegates to the jury the responsibility for defining what activity is fraudulent, and that is really the task of Parliament and not the jury. It also enables the prosecutor to prosecute in a criminal court for an activity which the prosecutor thinks ought to be a crime but is not defined as a crime on the statute book.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>It is because of this underlying defect&#151;I would say a constitutional defect&#151;in the definition of conspiracy to defraud that the Law Commission in its latest report stated, unequivocally, that the offence ought to be abolished. It also established&#151;in my view, beyond peradventure&#151;that the new definition of fraud is so comprehensive that it covers all the circumstances in which, previously, the offence of conspiracy to defraud had been deployed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1112"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1112</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>There are, however, circumstances that the new offence might not cover, and the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is one of the more important ones. I submit, however, that if the Government want to make the offence raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, an offence in criminal law&#151;which they ultimately did, in 1998&#151;they should do so in terms and not retain an ill-defined discretion to pick and choose what particular set of facts will be a crime in particular circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>In principle, I would be for following the recommendation from the Law Commission today. However, I recognise&#151;as did the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;that a number of authoritative bodies have suggested that there may yet be a role for the offence of conspiracy to defraud. I have said, both openly and in private to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, that I have been particularly influenced by the views of the committee chaired by Lord Justice Rose&#151;the finest criminal judge in the country. Therefore, the proposal made in the amendments gets the balance right. Let us see what happens&#151;and whether there is still a need for the offence&#151;then review the whole matter in three years&#039; time. I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General will respond constructively to the debate that has just taken place, as I would not want the Government and the Opposition to be confrontational on all this.
</p>

<a name="60314-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>In my submission, the offence ought not to be on the statute book. If the Attorney-General still doubts that&#151;since he is not only leader of the criminal Bar, but the Government&#039;s adviser on all these matters&#151;then his views should be given real weight. Yet the Law Commission has looked into it in intimate detail and its view should equally be given great weight. In my view, it should prevail after a period of three years.

<a name="60314-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   My Lords, I spoke at Second Reading in favour of abolishing conspiracy to defraud. In many ways, I still favour abolishing such a wide and amorphous way of prosecuting people. It seemed to me that we were missing an opportunity to be rid now of conspiracy to defraud, one which might not arise again. However, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General was good enough to send me the views of the Rose committee on this matter, and I have since had an opportunity to talk briefly with Lord Justice Rose. That leaves me in the awkward position of being in favour of both the Law Commission&#039;s strong recommendation and, at the same time, the views of Lord Justice Rose. At the moment I am wobbling down in favour of the latter, but I wait to hear how the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General replies.

<a name="60314-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, we return to a topic which we have debated at some length, most recently&#151;albeit some time ago&#151;on 19 July 2005. The essential argument against prospective repeal is that we do not yet have a clear picture of whether repeal is possible and, if so, whether ancillary changes to the law are needed. Let me just make good that latter <br>&nbsp;<br>

point; the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who has recently spoken, said, if I may paraphrase, that the Law Commission took the view that there was nothing that could not be prosecuted under the new offences that could not be prosecuted under conspiracy to defraud. The noble Lord shakes his head; rightly, if I misunderstood him, as that is not what the Law Commission said. It recognised that the new offences would not cover everything for which conspiracy to defraud could be used. I give way to the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60314-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful, my Lords, to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. I had thought that I had said in terms that the new offence of fraud did not cover all possible criminal offences. I had hoped to have made that clear, but if I did not then I would like to do so now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60314-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, then we are in agreement on what the Law Commission said. The Law Commission recognised that some of the things that would not be covered were things that it accepted there was a good case for saying should be criminal. I make this point at this stage because I have said that we do not yet have a clear picture of whether repeal is possible, and if so whether ancillary changes to the law are needed. Despite the fact that this point has arisen at Second Reading and in Committee, no one has come forward with amendments proposing changes that would go along with the repeal of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud so as to fit those gaps. I will come back to that&#151;it is one of the disadvantages of a prospective repeal, because we have not identified those gaps perhaps with sufficient precision to be able to say what would need to be put in their place.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The most important point is that we are not yet in a position to draw conclusions from the operation of the new fraud offences. We intend and hope that when the Fraud Act is in force, it will be the primary tool used to prosecute fraudsters. The offences in the Bill, and the charge of conspiracy to commit them, should be flexible enough to cover a wide variety of fraudulent activities, some of which have until now been difficult to capture. Aside from the new general offence, the offences of possessing and making articles to commit fraud and of fraudulent trading applicable to businesses other than companies will assist law enforcers to tackle frauds that previously may have required to be dealt with under the common law.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I have said before that we need to retain common law conspiracy to defraud for two reasons. We have spent a lot of time looking at this. It has meant not just that noble Lords have focused more on this, but we have focused more on this. I certainly have done so in detail. If anything, I am more persuaded at this point than I was before that we need to retain common law conspiracy to defraud for the time being. First, it has a broad practical application that the Bill&#039;s offences may not be able to reproduce in every case. The flexibility of the common law offence is most effective in containing the detail involved in very large and complex cases, where there may be many defendants and multiple counts on an indictment. The conspiracy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1114"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to defraud offence provides the ability for the prosecution to reveal and for the court to see a fraudulent course of conduct from beginning to end.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>On 19 July, I identified some of those people who had taken the view and responded to the Government&#039;s consultation by saying that the common law offence should not be repealed. They included, and that had been apparent from the start, those prosecutors who are charged with the responsibility of prosecuting these offences, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office. It went beyond that to the Association of Chief Police Officers; the Fraud Advisory Panel, which has a wide and experienced membership; the Law Society; the Confederation of British Industry; the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service; the British Bankers&#039; Association; the Association for Payment Clearing Services; and the British Retail Consortium. Quite a number of different bodies have supported it.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I referred also to the Rose committee in particular. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, asked me at that stage whether there was any record of what the Rose committee had said. I undertook to follow that up, and I sent to him and to others who took part in the debate the views of Lord Justice Rose and his committee in a letter dated 26 July 2005. As it has been referred to by all those who have spoken so far, it is right that I should put on the record what Lord Justice Rose wrote. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;It would be risky to repeal common law conspiracy to defraud as it can be the most effective charge in a case where multiple defendants are engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct. There are limitations on the law of statutory conspiracy, which has had something of a chequered history. All the judges present at the meeting agreed the Bill should not repeal common law conspiracy to defraud&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I find that a very strong endorsement of where we stand at the moment and of the approach that we ought to adopt.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>We will all recall the legislative solutions that we have proposed in the past to solve all problems, but which turned out, in the event, not to do so. This may have been in the mind of the Rose committee at the time. The Theft Acts themselves come into that category; they had to be amended several times and we are now making an even more radical change. It may therefore be cautious of us to want to retain the offence for the time being, but the caution is well supported by those who know what they are talking about. It is an appropriate caution in a serious matter.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="60314-07_time0"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The alternative&#151;I used the word on the last occasion&#151;would be irresponsible. In the face of prosecutors, police and senior judges saying that this is a risk, it is not a risk that I am prepared to take. Nobody who is serious about prosecuting fraud&#151;as I hope the whole House is&#151;would want to take that risk.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Nor do we want to add to the real problems we already face in the management of some trials of large or complex cases. We are grateful for the steps that the Lord Chief Justice has taken to address this issue in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1115"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

protocol for the control and management of heavy fraud and other complex criminal cases. Yet it is too early to reach a conclusion on its affect. We will return to that in the course of this Bill. We also hope that the provisions on multiple offending in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, which we plan to implement this year, will have an impact on the management of complex fraud trials. Yet we need experience of how that operates before we can conclude that it has had the affect that we hoped for.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The second reason not to repeal the common law is that there remain some specific forms of conduct that can be prosecuted only as conspiracy to defraud. One reason for that is the problem with statutory conspiracy, because of the limitations in that area of the law. In Committee, and in a letter sent out before that stage, I explained&#151;probably at too much length&#151;some of the problems. A particular problem is where the final offence is committed by somebody outside the conspiracy. A number of people can conspire together, the purpose of which is to ultimately enable someone else to commit an offence. If that person is outside the conspiracy, then they cannot all be charged as part of a statutory conspiracy. Statutory conspiracy also requires a degree of knowledge of the substantive offence to be committed. I have done my best to draw attention to what these problems are; I set it out in the letter, I explained it in the House, and I held an open meeting to which I invited all noble Lords who were interested to hear from technical experts so that we could go into these problems. Unfortunately, only the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was able to attend that meeting, but I have done by best to demonstrate the problems. I therefore strongly urge the House to recognise the undesirability of removing this offence for the time being.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would say that this is not what he is doing, because he leaves a minimum three-year period before the repeal would come into effect. That is not a satisfactory conclusion. It is not tidy, as far as legislation is concerned, to put prospective repeals on to the statute book. I certainly do not think that it is a good way of proceeding when one of the reasons for waiting is to see what gaps, if any, the new offences throw up. Surely the right way to proceed is to review the operation of the new offence, and see whether it establishes not only that the common law offence can after all be repealed, but also what changes may need to be made to go along with that, by bringing certain other offences into statute, and so forth.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I recognise two things: first, that it is necessary to review the operation of the act. I have made that clear, and that the act will be reviewed in three years&#039; time, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, says. That is where he gets his three years from. It will be reviewed. Secondly, I propose to recognise the concerns that some noble Lords have expressed about the overuse of conspiracy to defraud by giving guidance to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1116"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prosecutors when the new Act comes into effect, outlining the criteria to be considered before they use the common law offence. It will ask prosecutors to consider first whether the behaviour could be prosecuted under statute, under the Fraud Act 2006, or under some other Act as a statutory conspiracy. It will also outline the cases in which the common law charge may be appropriate and&#151;noble Lords may think this important&#151;will ask prosecutors to record their reasons for using the common law charge in any case for which they do so. That will have two benefits: it will ensure that the reviewing prosecutor has focused his or her mind on why the common law offence is the right one to use in that case; but it will also provide us with a record which we can then use to inform our further deliberations in three years&#039; time.

</p>

<a name="60314-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I am concerned that prospective repeal would create difficulties, leaving us with a degree of uncertainty in the law by having something on the statute book which might or might not come into effect. Prosecutors have to plan how they will deal with offences. These offences take time&#151;quite some time, in some cases&#151;to investigate. Knowing what charge you are going to be able to bring is important.
</p>

<a name="60314-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I will be happy to share with noble Lords a working draft of the guidance, if that will be helpful, but I urge noble Lords to see that my proposed review guidance, which will help to inform that review, ought to meet their concerns. It ought to be a happy compromise from our current position.

<p><a name="st_93"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I understand that it is the Home Secretary&#039;s intention to abolish jury trials in complex fraud cases through a stand-alone Bill, and not to proceed under Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Your Lordships will recall that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General announced in June last year that he would introduce measures in both Houses to activate Section 43. We started that process but it will not now be completed.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We on these Benches cannot agree that it is necessary or desirable to abolish juries in complex fraud cases. It is not thought to be in America. The trial of the two top people in Enron started in Houston, Texas at the end of January on 31 counts of conspiracy, fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors. In this country, counsel would then think that it would be a two-year case with, no doubt, return work for a considerable time. What is the estimate for the American case? Four months. A jury was chosen in a single day out of a jury panel of 100 and the case is now well under way.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>That raises the question: why do trials in this country in this type of case take such a long time and cost so much? Your Lordships will recall the Jubilee Line trial with six defendants. It collapsed after 18 months&#151;sickness and jury problems, lengthy delays and disruption dogged the proceedings so much that a fair trial became impossible.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I do not believe that it is the fault of the jury or the jury system. From experience, I know that if we were to maintain the same procedures as we had then in a trial before a single judge, not much would be gained. It is the procedures, which are hoary with age, that require to be looked at with a fresh eye. A criminal trial is deemed to commence when the jury is sworn and put in charge of the defendants. Everything that has gone <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1119"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1119</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before is regarded as a mere preliminary. In my view, a significant part of the trial should be completed before the jury is ever chosen and the calling of oral evidence begins. That is in accord with the Lord Chief Justice&#039;s introduction on 22 March last year of a protocol for the control and management of heavy fraud and other complex cases.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The noble and learned Lord referred to that in the debate on the previous amendment. From the point of view of this amendment, it was interesting to hear him say that it would be appropriate to have some time to see whether that protocol works. The proposal to abolish jury trials before the protocol has had the slightest chance of proving its worth is entirely premature. From what the noble and learned Lord said a moment ago, he might agree. The protocol gives guidance on case management, disclosure, abuse of process, and so on. It has the advantage of being flexible and can be changed from time to time as practice develops. However, the protocol does not have any statutory backing and cannot change the substantive law.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to create specific criminal procedure rules for complex fraud cases. It may be said by the noble and learned Lord that the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee already has power to make special provision in special types of cases. It seems to me that the complex fraud case requires rules of its own so that special procedures can be brought in. If those rules are brought into being, they will ensure that the issues are completely clear and open prior to the trial before the jury. No more would the defence hug to itself the nature of its defence and fail to disclose it. There should be a statement of case by both sides, agreement of facts and documents and disposal of all the issues which otherwise clutter up and delay the trial before the jury.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="60314-08_time0"></a><h5>4 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I consider it important that there should be a statutory framework for the indications of sentence by the trial judge on a plea of guilty. That is normally called plea bargaining. In no other case can there be so much saving of public money and court time than in these fraud cases which take so long. The process of plea bargaining has historically in this country been in disrepute on the basis that it places too much pressure on an innocent man to plead guilty and to settle for a lesser sentence. But there are, and always have been, considerable negotiations prior to trial between counsel on both sides as to the specific charges and the factual basis of a plea of guilty if one is tendered. So there is already a degree of plea bargaining in the system, and has been for as long as I can remember.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a> However, indications of sentence are not done openly. In my experience, indications of sentence have always been made. In the old days, the judge&#039;s clerk was the important conduit of information, but hints and winks give rise to misunderstanding. The climate has now changed completely. I look for a more open and transparent system. In the case of Goodyear in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1120"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

April of last year, a five-judge court of the Court of Appeal headed by the Lord Chief Justice and the Deputy Lord Chief Justice said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;We cannot, and do not seek to, water down the essential principle that the defendant&#039;s plea must always be made voluntarily and free from any improper pressure. On closer analysis, however, we cannot discern any clash between this principle, and a process by which the defendant personally may instruct his counsel to seek an indication from the judge of his current view of the maximum sentence which will be imposed on the defendant. In effect, this simply substitutes the defendant&#039;s legitimate reliance on counsel&#039;s assessment of the likely sentence with the more accurate indication provided by the judge himself&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>So the climate has changed dramatically and plea bargaining involving the judge is now countenanced by the Court of Appeal. It seems to me that it would be right and proper, particularly for this type of case, to introduce a statutory framework.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>With regard to procedures at trial, the amendment sets out significant procedural reforms. Juries are vetted now for their criminal records and, in relation to terrorist offences, by the security services. Questions are asked frequently of jurors where there might be bias. I recall the case of Shankland and Hancock, miners in the miners&#039; strike, and the death of a taxi driver as a result of a concrete block being thrown over a bridge. I recall the late and lamented Lord Williams of Mostyn on behalf of the defence asking the judge whether he could exclude anyone from the jury who was related to taxi drivers. For the prosecution, I said that I was not seeking to remove people who were related to miners, so we got on with it.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The point is that there always has been an attempt to see whether there is any inbuilt bias. I see no reason why in a fraud case inquiries cannot properly be made of the jury panel as to basic literacy, numeracy and familiarity with the English language, depending upon the nature of the case. Indeed, I note that the consultation paper put out by the Government in 1998 envisaged jury vetting in this type of case, to see whether the jury will understand. At the moment, the only check is if a juryman stumbles when he takes the oath&#151;frequently, he will then be asked by the judge to excuse himself if the case involves a lot of documents. There is no other opportunity for testing the competence of the juror. Noble Lords will see that I have therefore included in this amendment a provision to consider the vetting of juries.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The order of speeches in a criminal trial dates back to Lord Denman&#039;s Act&#151;to Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865. If the jury would grasp a complicated case by hearing counsel from both sides set out their stall at the beginning, there is no reason why opening statements from both sides should not be made. That is thought to be heretical at the moment, but there is no reason why it should not happen, as it does in other common-law countries. I also suggest in the amendment that there should be time for private consideration by the jury of all the documents, opening statements, agreed facts and so on. There is no reason why the jury should be plunged directly into the oral evidence.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1121"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I also refer to questioning by the jury. Questions can and frequently are asked by juries now, but they are in no way encouraged. There is almost no case law on this. I think that there is a brief reference in an 1896 case, but only in one modern case was it raised as a ground of appeal&#151;the case of Barnes in 1991. In that case, the judge was dissatisfied with the cross-examination of the defendant by prosecuting counsel and invited the jury to formulate additional questions. Lord Justice Russell, in the Court of Appeal, said that the practice of inviting juries to ask questions was generally speaking to be deprecated, because they are not familiar with the rules about evidence and might ask questions which would be difficult to deal with. The appeal failed, but the case turned on its own facts. In a complex case, by contrast, surely it would be sensible to put aside time to answer queries raised formally by the jury at any stage of the trial. Communication is a good thing. Their questions might well throw up misunderstandings that can be quickly cleared up or points that can be answered by the evidence.
</p>

<a name="60314-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I do not suggest that this amendment contains an exhaustive list of procedural improvements. A significant shortening of trials might arise from another quarter&#151;the Government&#039;s other proposals gradually to reduce refresher fees to counsel as the days draw on. Before Third Reading, the Government might like to take time to consider the existing protocol that has been issued by the Lord Chief Justice&#151;bearing in mind, as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said, that it has not had time to work&#151;backed by procedural rules that can make substantive changes to current procedures. I suggest that that is a better way forward. Before this Government make another of their never-ending attempts to abolish the fundamental principle of jury trials, they should see whether these less drastic reforms will bring the improvements in time and cost that they want and that anyone who is concerned with the efficient and proper dispatch of the processes of the criminal justice system also requires. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60314-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has said some constructive things. He introduces an important aspect, to which I am sure the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General will give thought. The key to the solution to the problem of jury trials lies not in the jury but in the prosecution and the judge and in taking and keeping a firm grip on the case from start to finish.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>We have had many debates on the jury system. The key points in favour of the jury are its independence, the care with which it considers such cases and the confidence that it carries with the public.  It is perfectly clear&#151;it could hardly be clearer than from the Jubilee Line case, which seems to have set this particular hare running&#151;that the problem when major and complex cases collapse, as, from time to time, they do, lies not with the jury but with the judge or the prosecutor.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I grew up, in parliamentary terms, with the development of the Serious Fraud Office. I remember vividly the days when long and complex frauds were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1122"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tried, even before the era of the fraud investigation groups which, for the first time, brought police, accountants and prosecutors&#151;barristers&#151;to work closely together. In the end, that was taken forward&#151;very successfully, in my view&#151;by the Serious Fraud Office. It is that fraud investigation group approach&#151;that combination of professions&#151;that is of the essence in successful prosecution of fraud. It was highly controversial from time to time during the late 1980s and early 1990s. There were one or two collapses and the unfortunate Serious Fraud Office was sometimes called the &quot;serious farce office&quot;. That was mostly extremely unfair. It highlighted the fact that the kind of people whom you must prosecute are often very powerful people in their own right. They have made a great deal of money, often dishonestly, and they spend it fighting the case&#151;as they are perfectly entitled to do&#151;both in court and through the newspapers.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I invite the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to backtrack. If we actually analyse how serious fraud cases have been tried during the past 15 years, we find that the great majority have been effectively tried. Juries are in no sense reluctant to convict in cases of serious fraud. In fact, conviction levels&#151;if one pays attention to them&#151;are actually higher than in the ordinary run of criminal cases. The main theme of my speech is that, when a case has gone wrong, it is nearly always, in fact I think always, the fault either of the prosecution&#151;I say that kindly, because these are difficult cases to prosecute&#151;or of the judge, or both.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I saw a slight wrinkle on the brow of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General when I mentioned the Jubilee Line case, but I think that we are still waiting for the report&#151;at least, the Library cannot find it&#151;

</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60314-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. My brow did wrinkle&#151;I apologise for wrinkling&#151;simply because the noble and learned Lord suggested that it was the collapse of the Jubilee Line case that prompted the Government to implement Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I can assure him that it was not. It was passed in 2003 and the decision to implement it had been taken before the Jubilee Line case. I have never suggested, and I do not suggest, that the Jubilee Line case, which has particular features, is the reason or a justification for the measure. That is the reason for my wrinkle.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60314-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord. Wrinkles are helpful: one should be sensitive to every mark and move in a debate. The noble and learned Lord is absolutely right. Although there was a great deal of reference by government to that after the Jubilee Line case&#151;it certainly came out in the newspapers that one solution was going to be to abolish the jury&#151;I will rapidly accept if he tells me so that it did not come from the Attorney-General&#039;s Chambers. However, it certainly figured in newspaper reports at the time and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1123"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Jubilee Line case is an exact example of the kind of case where no one could have suggested that it was the fault of the jury.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The highest one could go&#151;even this would be a bad point&#151;would be to say that the fact that one has to explain things to the jury or that one has to argue things in the absence of the jury in some ways complicates the case, but I put it no higher than that. The Jubilee Line case, to have it on the record, was supposed to take 18 months. It was still going on after two years and the prosecution case had not even been concluded. In the last seven months of the case the jury got into court on only 13 out of 91 days. I take those figures from <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper and they may or may not be accurate, but that was what was stated in the public prints; it is quite instructive.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="60314-09_time0"></a><h5>4.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Again I have made efforts and I look to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to tell us when we are going to see the CPS Inspectorate&#039;s report on the case. One of the things that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said at that time was that he was determined to put an end to fraud cases that took 18 months or longer. Will he in his winding-up speech tell us whether we can have an end to 12-month inquiries into collapsed cases? We are coming up to the anniversary of the collapse of the Jubilee Line case and we are waiting to hear what the CPS Inspectorate thinks about it and to have the opportunity to reflect on its analysis. I close on the key point, to which I return: for 10 years, from 1987 to 1997, I looked at every serious complex fraud case that collapsed. In every case it was a combination of over-complexity, as it was with the Jubilee Line case. The word on the street among my friends at the criminal Bar is that the essence of the Jubilee Line case was corruption and it was complicated by a complex addition of fraud charges. It could probably have been dealt with a great deal more expeditiously and simply.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Mr Stephen Wooler and his colleagues will be reflecting on that matter and I am sure they will answer that point among others. The other point is that it is important to have a judge who is an expert in the field. The judge in that case was deeply respected and a fine ordinary criminal judge&#151;by saying &quot;ordinary criminal&quot; I do not mean that that is any less clever-clever, or anything else, but it is different from having experience of long and complex fraud cases. She was invited to take on the case in her 69th year&#151;her last case. In the management of such matters one has to be careful who one asks to do things and at what stage in their career, because the combination led to the problem. That is not new; it had happened before in one form or another in all of the serious complex cases that collapsed between 1987 and 1997. The blame should not be laid at the door of the juries, and our liberties, which depend so strongly on the jury, should not be swept aside.

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60314-09_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene before the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, speaks. I have one or two random points to make in regard to jury trial and the present situation. First, it would be totally unrealistic if we did not recognise that there was a perception among the minorities that one obtained a better category of justice through trial by judge and jury than by judge alone. There is a basis to that perception. Some may have an inbuilt, albeit perhaps very rare, bias against the defence. The professional judge can become case-hardened as a result of hearing the same defence over and over again, whereas the jury has not heard it before or has come to it with a greater understanding. Certainly, the jury does not run the risk of missing a good case because of the very small incidence in which it has care. I think this perception is particularly strong among foreigners who come to this country and among the minorities who are convinced that they stand a much better chance of a sympathetic hearing before a jury than before a judge alone.
</p>

<a name="60314-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Another matter to which I wish to draw attention is the suggestion about plea bargaining. It is a long time since I was personally involved as chairman of the Bar Council, when I discussed this matter with the then Lord Chief Justice and the fact that the greatest degree to which a judge would permit a discussion was to say, &quot;Win, lose or draw, the sentence is likely to be X&quot;, and that anything else ran the risk of putting pressure on the accused to accept what could so easily be put in front of him to speed up the process. It is highly dangerous&#151;this has happened so frequently in other jurisdictions&#151;to put too much weight on the sentence and the degree to which it can be reduced in order to speed up the process. It results in sloppy preparation and over-indictment, and it places the accused in a highly difficult position.

I am emboldened to speak by an experience that I had some 30 years ago, when I prosecuted what was then the longest fraud trial in Scotland in 1964 or 1965; indeed, it was the longest trial of any kind in Scotland for more than 30 years&#151;it lasted 18 days. That is a rather different type of trial from the Jubilee Line or others mentioned by Lord Roskill.

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I looked with great care at Lord Roskill&#039;s report&#151;I have no doubt that many of your Lordships are extremely familiar with it. According to my analysis of the perhaps 28 types of fraud that were specified and analysed in that report, almost all&#151;I think 27 of them&#151;depended on proving that someone had forged a signature, substituted a false document, destroyed documents or something of that kind. Ultimately, the point tends to be rather simple. For that type of reason, I support the principle behind this amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas.

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Even complex fraud cases turn on one or two fairly simple points which can be demonstrated with appropriate skills to juries. In Scotland, we are so confident in the capacity of jurors to pick up the point that we do not have opening speeches in jury trials. I have always argued that it is important for the jury to understand the case not at the beginning, but at the end of the trial. The speech can introduce only elements of prejudice. I would maintain that position even in relation to matters of fraud.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>In my time at the Bar, which now exceeds half a century, there have been enormous advances in the technical aids available. I have seen television used very skilfully, and other technical aids used which enable juries to understand what is going on. I have written about this final point previously. Lawyers who practise in front of courts have an immense amount to learn from television presenters. You can watch a television programme for 30 minutes, an hour, or an hour and a half, and can discover all that you need to know about Enron or any other big fraud case. It is time that lawyers, including judges, learnt the skills that journalists bring to the presentation to the public of complex matters on television. For those general reasons, I hope that your Lordships will forgive me for rising to support the principle behind the amendment.

<a name="60314-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I have received an oral assurance from the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General that the Government will proceed to implement Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 only by primary legislation. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will confirm that on the Floor of the House. On that basis, we have not tabled an amendment to remove Section 43 from the 2003 Act. Had we done so, its text would have been very close to that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and justified for the reasons that the noble Lord has so comprehensively given.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General&#039;s assurance is consistent with the undertaking given to another place by the right honourable gentleman the Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, at Third Reading of the Criminal Justice Bill. He said that if Section 43 remained on the face of the Bill, full consultation would take place with the opposition parties, followed by a proposal which would form part of subsequent primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I understand that the Government intend to bring forward in another place a single-issue Bill on jury trial in complex fraud cases as early as parliamentary time will allow. I hope that, before they take that decision, at least the decision about timing, they will reflect on a number of considerations.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>First, we have spent a great deal of time in your Lordships&#039; House debating a new definition of fraud. One of the reasons why this review by the Law Commission has been undertaken is that the old definition was deeply unsatisfactory. It was over-complex and, in addition, not sufficiently comprehensive. Would it not be a good idea for the Government to give an opportunity for the new definition to take effect? It may be that the greater <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1126"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

simplicity of the definition of &quot;fraud&quot; will be more easily understood by juries and will, therefore, shorten trials&#151;which is the main purpose for which the noble and learned Lord has expressed concern about the continued existence of juries in complex fraud cases.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said so effectively, let us have some more time to see what effect the protocol of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, will have; because that too may have a dramatic influence on the length of complex fraud trials.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The evidence before us so far does not establish that the existence of juries in complex fraud cases lengthens those cases. I hope that, before the Government will consider bringing legislation before another place, the noble and learned Lord will engage in an examination of at least some of the major complex fraud cases that have taken place in the past two or three years, to try and determine exactly what role the jury plays. We know that the noble and learned Lord does not consider the problem to be the make-up of the jury&#151;because he has expressed his view that having a jury of experts rather than laymen would contribute nothing to the solution. It is not the composition of the jury but the fact of the jury which is his problem. May I suggest that he looks at, say, a dozen cases that have taken place over the past two years, to establish what contribution the fact of the jury has made to the length of the case? We would all find that evidence enormously valuable.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60314-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, would repeal a provision that was enacted two years ago and replace it with another which, as I shall explain, will add little or nothing to the law as it stands and would, in the Government&#039;s view, be ineffective in dealing with the problem presented by very long fraud trials.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that in a small number of complex fraud cases, where strict statutory criteria&#151;including the approval of the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice&#151;have been met, the trial may take place without a jury. The implementation of Section 43 was made subject to the unusual requirement of the affirmative resolution process of both Houses, explicitly an order to enable discussions to take place with the parties opposite about possible alternatives to trial by judge alone. I do not want to raise the temperature in the House by labouring the point too much, but the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, knows well that I do not agree with him on the interpretation of what was said at the conclusion of that Bill. In particular, I do not agree that there was any undertaking that the implementation of Section 43 would only take place through primary legislation; quite the opposite. However, a year ago I chaired a seminar intended to be the forum for the discussions promised.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Your Lordships may recall that last June, when I announced the Government&#039;s intention of seeking to implement Section 43, there was some discontent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1127"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about the manner in which we had made good our undertaking again. I will make it clear: I do not and I have never accepted that discontent. Be that as it may, the point was raised again when the order was debated in Committee in another place. It therefore seemed desirable to have another attempt at engaging with the parties opposite. I have been happy to do that and a meeting took place on 25 January. I had hoped to be able to say that as a result of that meeting, agreement had been reached on the terms on which Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act could be implemented. I put forward a number of possible modifications that the Government would have been content to make to the statutory arrangements, and there was some indication that these, taken together, might prove acceptable to the opposition parties. I very much regret that, to date, it has not proved possible for them to agree such a compromise.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, argues that trials could be reduced in length by special procedures of the kind set out in his amendment, which he considered would promote better case management. But much of what he proposes has already been done. Case management tools are already available in serious fraud cases. For example, in the type of serious or complex fraud we are discussing, a preparatory hearing under the Criminal Justice Act 1987 almost invariably will be held. In those circumstances, I do not understand what his proposal for management hearings for complex fraud case trials adds to what is already provided. Under the 1987 Act the judge already has extensive powers to regulate how the prosecution presents its case as well as powers to order the defence to identify its objections. Many measures are already in place to ensure better case management. They can be found in the Criminal Procedure Rules or in the last Lord Chief Justice&#039;s protocol for the control and management of heavy fraud and other complex criminal cases. Again, there they are.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Not for a moment do I deny the importance of applying good case management tools. I am strongly in favour of that, and have said so on a number of occasions, but I waited to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, which of the provisions in his amendment actually adds something new to rules which already exist, to powers which already exist, or to rule-making powers which already exist. He spent some time on the issue of indications of sentence, but as he himself has recognised, a five-man Court of Appeal&#151;it is an important event when a five-man court sits specifically in order to consider making a change to practice&#151;decided in Goodyear that sentence indications, on the application of the defendant, as the noble Lord&#039;s amendment says, should be possible. They so decided and to my certain knowledge&#151;and no doubt to that of the noble Lord as well&#151;it is now happening in courts up and down the country. There may be differences of view on whether it is a good idea, and I note the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner; I certainly do not think they are a bad thing. On the contrary, I agree <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1128"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that they are desirable, just as I agree it is desirable that, if possible, there should be agreements on schedules of relevant facts and issues, and that statements should be made by both sides. That is set out specifically in the protocol of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf: there should be statements of case.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said it would be a good idea if the defendant made an opening statement. I have been in court when such things have happened. It is not regular, but nothing at the moment would prevent it taking place. So while I do not deny the desirability of good case management, nothing in this amendment adds to the powers that already exist. What is more, it might be harmful. If one appears to give specific powers in the case of serious fraud, that could cast doubt on whether powers already given to the committee are sufficient to allow it to make rules covering all criminal proceedings.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, talked about lawyers becoming television presenters and presenting their cases in half or three-quarters of an hour. If the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor were now in his place on the Woolsack, responsible as he is for the Legal Aid Fund I do not doubt that he would be absolutely delighted at the prospect. So too might members of the public be delighted to see cases presented in that way. Again, I do not for a moment underestimate the desirability of the points made.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>However&#151;this is the second objection&#151;I do not believe that welcome though better case management is, it would be a complete solution in complex fraud trials. I have previously pointed out that one of my major concerns is that the effect of measures designed to reduce a case to manageable size may be that crucial evidence cannot be heard by the jury. How is case management achieved? Frequently, the judge requires a case to be severed, or the prosecution recognises that it must sever a case by taking out defendants or counts. In the Maxwell case, for example, although the prosecution, the judge and almost all defence counsel believed it would be best if all matters were heard together, the view was that this would be unmanageable before a jury, and so it did not happen.
</p>

<a name="60314-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Where efforts are made to reduce the amount of evidence put before juries, the effect can be that the defendants do not face justice for the full extent of their criminality. In one well known case the defendant pleaded guilty to two out of 22 counts and received a non-custodial sentence. The trial judge had excluded a substantial body of evidence, not because it was irrelevant or inadmissible, but because it would be unimaginable for the jury, and would make the trial unacceptably long.

Regrettably, it came to that rather unsatisfactory conclusion, but I am afraid it falls into the category of <br>&nbsp;<br>

things going wrong because of the prosecution or the judge&#151;or both. It fell fairly and squarely into that category. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is making detailed points about the submissions of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and I understand what he is getting at, but he is not grappling with the key point, which is whether it would be better to get rid of the jury.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60314-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, that is exactly my point. Having said that I do not, with respect, believe that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, adds anything to the existing powers, my second point is that it does not solve the problem. You do not solve the problem of a small number of serious and complex fraud cases by cutting down the material the prosecution can put forward. This risks not presenting the full case to the jury. Much of the opposition to Section 43 rests on the principle that there is an inalienable right to trial by jury. The Government are committed to retaining jury trial in almost all Crown Court cases.
</p>

<a name="60314-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, made an important point about the confidence that certain parts of our community have in juries. I do not disagree with him about that, but they are not, I think, the people we are concerned with in this small number of serious complex fraud cases. The reality is that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases in this country are dealt with, perfectly ably, in a magistrates&#039; court, either by lay justices or by professional judges without any jury present. I have some difficulty, in this context, in understanding the objection to judge-alone trial. I do not understand why the opponents in this category of case have so little faith in our judiciary. Single judges already make momentous decisions in civil cases; they are quite capable of making decisions about the guilt or innocence of defendants.

<a name="60314-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord. I do not want to keep jumping up, but I am not sure whether the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General has answered my noble friend on whether we are to have primary legislation before there is any attempt to do away with the jury in any part of serious fraud cases. My understanding, before this debate, was that what my noble friend Lord Kingsland said was indeed what was agreed regarding the jury. Therefore, there is an awful lot to be said in answer to the points that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is putting forward. There are very real points to be made, but I assume that they will be made in future primary legislation, and not this afternoon.

<a name="60314-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, in a sense the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, is right. I shall come in a moment to what the Government are going to do. Having told the Opposition, who have brought the question of jury trial into the Fraud Bill, that I want to separate the two issues and that the Government intend to bring forward a stand-alone <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1130"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill to deal with those issues, I had not anticipated that we would have a debate this afternoon. But, entirely properly, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, tabled an amendment and spoke to it in spirited terms, and other noble Lords contributed to the debate. Therefore, it is only right that I should say what the Government&#039;s position is, particularly as the noble and learned Lord and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, have asked me to reconsider.
</p>

<a name="60314-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Parliament has already recognised that in certain cases the right to jury trial can be overridden by other considerations. Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 contains&#151;in addition to Section 43&#151;provision for trial by judge alone in jury tampering cases. That is an exceptional case, but Parliament believed that it was right to take that step. We believe that it is very important that the criminal justice system is able properly to deal with white-collar crime as it can deal with blue-collar crime. We still believe that Section 43 is an important step in that direction. It would bring to an end the problem that in a handful of very complex fraud trials much of the evidence cannot even be put before the jury, and it would spare citizens the intolerable burden of sitting as jurors in such cases. It was not proposed lightly. This debate has been going on for 20 years. The fraud trials committee presided over by Lord Roskill argued as long ago as 1986 that trial by jury was unsatisfactory in serious fraud cases. There was a public consultation in 1998 which supported by two to one replacing jury trial in serious fraud cases. The same line was taken by Lord Justice Auld in his independent review in 2001.
</p>

<a name="60314-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>We demonstrated our willingness to consider modifications to the scheme provided for in Section 43 by entering with good faith into discussions with opposition parties. It is clear that there is no immediate prospect of those discussions bearing fruit and leading to a compromise position which delivers the necessary improvements to the efficacy of fraud trials. In those circumstances, it cannot be right to delay this modest but desirable Bill any longer. The Government, while remaining committed to the policy contained in Section 43, have taken the view that we need to separate this issue from the passage of the Fraud Bill. We therefore propose to bring forward fresh primary legislation to give effect to that policy as soon as parliamentary time allows rather than bringing forward an order giving effect to Section 43. No doubt when that Bill comes before the House, all the points that have been raised today and all the other points will be argued and debated. I have only responded a little in kind to the points that have been made. As it stands, the only amendment before the House is that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, which I believe in any event he will not press to a Division. I invite him to withdraw it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60314-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, I had understood, until the latter part of his speech, that his main objection to the existence of juries in complex fraud trials was the consequence for their existence of the length of those trials; in other words, if we remove juries, trials will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1131"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shorter. But towards the end of the noble and learned Lord&#039;s speech, he seemed to indicate a different motive. He seemed to suggest that evidence could be brought before a single judge which could not be brought before a jury; in other words, evidence that would be admissible before a single judge would be inadmissible before a jury&#151;I am interpreting what the noble and learned Lord said and I want to be clear about it&#151;and the consequence of that would be a greater conviction rate in fraud trials.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60314-11_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I certainly was not suggesting any difference in the admissibility of evidence. The point that I have made is not new at all. I will illustrate it via the Maxwell prosecution, to which I made reference before. The trial judge then, who is in fact the present Lord Chief Justice, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The prosecution and most of the defence are agreed that, were it practicable, all the counts should be the subject matter of a single trial. All are agreed that the length and complexity of such a trial would far outstrip the capacity of any jury&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The result was that he then split the case into smaller portions so that each could go before a jury. However, following acquittals in the first trial, another judge, Mr Justice Buckley, who was due to hear the second trial, stayed the proceedings on the ground of abuse of process. The end result was that it was not possible to put all the evidence before a single trial&#151;it was put forward in smaller parts&#151;while the rest was not tried either.

January 2005.

If the Lord Chief Justice&#151;as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, is now&#151;is right about that, a new Bill in another place, whatever else its consequences might be, will not cut the cost of fraud trials.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60314-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all your Lordships who have spoken in this debate. I can tell the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, that I recall there being a brass plaque in the second assize court of the old Stafford assizes which commemorated the longest trial in England up to that date. That was 17 days, which slightly beats the record of 18 days to which he referred.
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General takes issue with me on a number of points. First, my amendment was set down at the beginning of last week, but on Friday I learnt from him that there was no intention of seeking to proceed with the orders under Section 43. It seems to me that I am entitled to put this amendment forward and to have it debated as it has been. I have delayed the passage of this Bill by one hour in so doing.
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The second issue that the noble and learned Lord mentioned is that there is nothing new in the amendment. When the Criminal Procedure Rules that are now in place were formulated following the Courts Act 2003, they were not novel. They sought to put together the best practice, so that the best practice would be available for all sorts of Crown trials. In putting forward the amendment, I am seeking to demonstrate best practice in fraud trials. What framework is best suited for complex fraud cases? What is the best framework that we can employ to prevent the length and the expense of fraud trials, which have not been the best part of the criminal justice process over the past few years?
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>There are novel points in the amendment&#151;for example, giving statutory force to the protocol of the Lord Chief Justice. There is a lot to be said for the protocol. It is flexible. There is also a lot to be said for having behind the protocol a steady, firm framework, from which judges who are trying these cases can derive the way in which they propose to manage their cases.
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>There are also references to the way in which a jury operates. Questioning and the ability to retire to consider documents have not been tried, so far as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1133"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I know, in this country. Electronic presentation of evidence does occur. Oddly, no one has got on to the limitation of prolix cross-examination. That is important and should have statutory backing so that the judge can prevent counsel from going on day after day. I hope that your Lordships appreciate that I am seeking to produce a cost-effective and justice-effective system. I am doing so from experience. I do not say that the amendment is perfect; I do not say that it is all new. But it is to my mind a better way of going about things than abolishing the principle&#151;and it is a principle&#151;that a person should be tried by his peers, whether in a complex fraud case or whatever. The jury principle is fundamental to the justice system of this country and, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, said, it is a system that commands the respect of all members of society.
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>As the noble and learned Lord has indicated, I do not propose to press the amendment at this stage. I ask him to think about it before Third Reading and I also ask him to consider the position if he brings forward a fresh Bill. I suggest that there should be a delay to allow the protocol to operate and to see how it works in practice before any primary legislation to abolish juries is brought before us again. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="60314-12_time0"></a><h5>4.58 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="60314-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b> 
<a name="60314-12_state0"></a>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;I am today publishing a White Paper on the future of the BBC entitled <i>A Public Service for All: the BBC in the Digital Age</i>. It does exactly what that describes.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;We live in an era of change. In broadcasting, new technologies are leading to vastly more television and radio channels and new media services. The BBC&#039;s charter needs to create a BBC strong enough to thrive in the new environment and flexible enough to adapt to new challenges. Over 70 per cent of households now have digital television. As digital delivers ever more choice, some describe the BBC as an anachronism. The Government disagree. More importantly, the British public disagree. Our unprecedented engagement with the people of this country&#151;10,000 of whom wrote to us&#151;has shown that people right across the country want a strong <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1134"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

BBC, independent of government, and Parliament, and responsive to public wishes. The new charter gives the public the BBC that they want.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;The Reithian principles to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot; will be maintained, but we will give audiences and competitors greater clarity about what this means in practice. We will give the BBC six new purposes: sustaining citizenship; promoting education; stimulating creativity; reflecting the identity of the UK&#039;s nations, regions and communities; bringing the world to the UK and the UK to the world; and building digital Britain, where the BBC will act as a trusted guide.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;There was strong public support for this. At the same time, licence fee payers told us it all sounded a bit worthy. What they cared about most was getting BBC programmes that they wanted to watch and listen to. So the White Paper makes entertainment central to the BBC&#039;s mission. The BBC should continue to take fun seriously, engraining entertainment into its services. This is not about writing the BBC a blank cheque or chasing ratings through copy-cat programming. It is about ensuring that the BBC delivers what licence fee payers deserve: quality and distinctiveness.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;But the BBC&#039;s governance structure has become anachronistic. The BBC needs a new form of accountability to licence fee payers, as the BBC&#039;s shareholders. Our new arrangements will make the BBC closer to the people who pay for it and more accountable to them. In a step change for the BBC&#039;s governance, we will abolish the BBC governors and replace them with two new bodies: the BBC Trust and a separate executive board. The trust will be the licence fee payer&#039;s voice. It will act as a proxy for the BBC&#039;s shareholders, making it the first public interest body on this scale the country has ever seen. There has been nothing like it before.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;The trust will oversee the executive board, whose own job will be to run the BBC&#039;s services. There will be clear separation of responsibilities between the trust and executive board. Although the trust will be the sovereign body of the BBC&#151;its word will be final&#151;the new charter and agreement will prevent it doing the executive&#039;s job. This is critical to maintaining the objectivity required to generate public confidence. This truly is a step change in the governance and regulation of the BBC. It is a unique solution for a unique organisation in unique circumstances.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;An important part of getting the best programmes to the screen is competition for quality programmes. The White Paper requires the BBC to operate a commissioning system which balances in-house production of the scale necessary to deliver the BBC&#039;s wider public service role with encouraging competition for quality between in-house, independent and external producers. This new &#039;window of creative competition&#039; should result in the independent quota of 25 per cent becoming genuinely a floor, and not a ceiling.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1135"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60314-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;I repeat our welcome in principle for the BBC&#039;s proposals to move a significant amount of production to north-west England, helping to ensure that the licence fee is used as venture capital for the whole nation&#039;s creativity. The trust will need to satisfy itself that the plans represent value for money on behalf of the licence fee payer.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;The BBC will continue as the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. We are equally committed to sustaining a dynamic commercial sector. We are putting in place a &#039;triple lock&#039; system to ensure the highest standards of accountability. First, the trust will issue licences to the executive board for running each BBC service. Secondly, BBC content will have to have distinctive characteristics, such as being original, of high quality, challenging or innovative. Thirdly, a public value test will be applied to all new BBC services or significant changes to existing services.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;Responding to concerns raised on the Green Paper, I am happy to clarify that whenever the trust carries out a public value test, Ofcom will provide the market impact assessment to guarantee rigour and ensure wider public confidence. We will also put in place a new duty on the trust to have regard to competition issues; <i>ex ante</i> codes in specific areas that have the potential to raise competition concerns; an overhauled fair trading regime; and a fair, transparent complaints system.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;The White Paper also confirms that the BBC will be fully licence fee funded for the next charter. There will be future reviews into the scope for other methods of funding the BBC beyond 2016 and the possibility of distributing public funding&#151;including licence fee money&#151;beyond the BBC.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The process of deciding the next licence fee settlement has started. Licence fee payers and industry will help form our conclusions. We will expect the BBC to achieve a large part of its funding through self-help and the trust will need to make tough decisions about how resources are allocated within the boundaries of the settlement. To help the trust exercise stewardship of the licence fee, the relationship between the BBC and the National Audit Office will be strengthened within the existing arrangements.


</p>

<a name="60314-12_para26"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;Despite past predictions, public service broadcasting, led by the BBC, remains the bedrock of today&#039;s media. If it is to thrive in the digital age, the BBC must remain future-proof and politician-proof. We are optimists about the long-term future of the BBC, but it cannot take its position for granted. It must develop its role over the next 10 years, strengthening its accountability, bringing in new generations of viewers and listeners and building a consensus around the value of its place in Britain. The White Paper gives it the means to build that consensus and I commend it to the House&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60314-12_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60314-13_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. The BBC is a unique, much loved and much cherished institution. It stands out as a beacon of excellence, across the country and across the world. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the BBC we pass on to future generations is equipped to flourish in the decades ahead. All over the globe people turn to the BBC for an independent view of world events. The Conservative Party is committed to ensuring the future of the BBC and that it remains the best public service broadcaster in the world.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>That is why this White Paper is somewhat of a disappointment. It singularly fails to meet the main challenges that now face the BBC. It was supposed to provide us with a springboard to the new digital age, but it is simply not fit for the purpose. It goes only halfway and will not last for the 10 years of the new charter and agreement. Digital television, broadband, the internet, podcasting and on-demand viewing are transforming the world in which the BBC operates, and will change for ever the future of public service television in this country.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>It is so important that the BBC, which is bound by the highest standards of quality, impartiality and integrity, makes decisions in the interest of the public, and not in the interests of Ministers and the Government. That is why the BBC needs a proper, independent regulator, something missing from the Government&#039;s proposal. Why is Ofcom able to regulate every other broadcaster in this country, but not the BBC?
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The Government have rejected almost every proposal of the all-party House of Lords Select Committee on the BBC Charter Review, chaired by my noble friend Lord Fowler. They have rejected the case for the BBC to be established by Act of Parliament, making it accountable to Parliament and not just to a department of the Government. Instead, we have the BBC trust and executive board proposed by the Secretary of State, but they are really no more than a separate set of BBC governors at another building, with twice the cost and twice the number of appointments to make. It ultimately fails adequately to separate governance and regulation. That is what is important. We must have a system in place whereby those regulating content, impartiality and standards of the BBC see themselves as responsible to the licence fee payer and to Parliament, not just to the Government and the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The BBC is a unique organisation in a unique position, and because of that we must ensure that that position is not abused to the detriment of other broadcasters or, indeed, the viewing public.  We cannot have a situation where a publicly funded BBC is allowed to outspend and outgun its competitors with the result that it prevents innovation and stifles competition. The public value test is a good concept, but Ofcom should be involved with the test, not just limited to producing a market impact assessment.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We agree that funding by the licence fee is still the best way forward for the BBC. But we know that there will be an unprecedented increase in the funding of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1137"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

BBC. We shall see an increase from about &#163;3 billion to about &#163;5 billion by 2013. Why does the settlement require such an increase? I am afraid that the deft hand of the Chancellor of Exchequer is at play. The Government are using the charter renewal as a Trojan horse to pay for their policy of digital switchover. The settlement is purely a mechanism to fund government policy. In the process, the Chancellor will grab between &#163;2 billion and &#163;5 billion as a result of selling off the freed up analogue spectrum after switchover is complete in 2012. He has a history. He made &#163;27 billion from the sell-off of the 3G networks, and is looking to repeat the exercise. That will fall on the viewing public and licence fee payers. In an example of the stealthiest of stealth taxes, the Chancellor hopes that by using the word &quot;spectrum&quot;, the unsuspecting public will not realise that the Chancellor and the Government have imposed the first new Labour television tax.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Now that it is official that the licence fee is a tax, the National Audit Office should be involved in scrutinising licence fee bids. The cost of switchover is forcing the increase in the licence fee to an eventual &#163;180 a year, which will hit the poorest in Britain and those on low on fixed incomes. What help will the Government give to those who cannot afford the cost of digital switchover? Indeed, what help will be given to those who cannot receive digital television in the future?
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The White Paper, the draft Royal charter and agreement, and the regulatory impact assessment will take careful reading. I cannot hope to deal with the many issues today. I shall just say that I am glad that &quot;training&quot; still features strongly in the BBC plans. I am disappointed that the provision of news is not one of the six purposes, or even the seventh purpose, outlined by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The BBC is one of the great brands of the world. That brand combined with continued quality programme making will allow the BBC to compete and thrive in the varied and many ways of delivering content to consumers. We want to ensure a future for a stronger and independent BBC. The Government have undermined that by putting at risk the public confidence in the licence fee and failing to ensure good governance and the integrity of the institution.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60314-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches believe that the test of the White Paper must be whether or not it guarantees a strong, independent and securely funded BBC that is equipped to meet the challenges of the digital age, strengthened in its independence from government and set to remain an institution held in high regard throughout the world. I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in the other place.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>There is much in the White Paper to commend. There is a clear statement of purposes for the BBC: emphasising quality, not ratings; increased opportunities for independent production through the window of creative competition&#151;or WOC, as we shall <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1138"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all come to call it; greater public scrutiny of BBC finances under the National Audit Office; continuation of funding via the licence fee; and the charter lasting 10 years to ensure long-term planning.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>But we have some concerns. The first is about regulation. While a proposed BBC trust is an improvement on the BBC governors, it is still not a totally independent regulator if it is to have strategic oversight over BBC decisions. It is even described in the White Paper as the sovereign body within the BBC. Clearly it is still part of the BBC. Governance is not being separated from regulation.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>We welcome the new market framework. The new proposals are tougher than at present. Ofcom&#039;s role in assessing market impact is welcome. But the BBC will remain its own judge and jury when it introduces a public value test for new services. That is also true in terms of <i>ex ante</i> rules. Is there not a need for a clear process for appeals to a truly independent authority? Should not there be a single, new, independent regulator for all public service broadcasters; namely, a public service broadcasting commission? It is one of the options rejected by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>On the question of demands made on the BBC, is not there a danger that the BBC will be buried under innumerable government targets? It is slightly concerning that the last charter and agreement had between them 43 clauses. The new charter and agreement have between them 175 clauses&#151;more than a fourfold increase. Given those demands, will the Government rule out a raid on licence fee payers to fund all those demands? For instance, do they agree that targeted assistance to help disadvantaged households to switch to digital should be paid out of general taxation? Should not the regeneration benefits, as distinct from programming improvements from the BBC&#039;s move to Manchester, be paid by the Manchester authorities and not TV viewers nationwide? Should not the NAO be asked to comment on proposals for the level of the licence fee?
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Finally, the BBC does not operate in isolation. Does the Minister agree that competition is good for the BBC? If so, will the Government make a firm commitment to preserve the plurality of public service broadcasting, for example, by protecting the future of Channel 4? As regards the new public purposes for the BBC, we welcome the clearer statement of purposes. However, we seek reassurance that the task of sustaining citizenship will not be a green light for would-be censors to seek to ensure that every minute of BBC output conforms to their own view of citizenship and society.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>On these Benches, we believe that the BBC should continue to contribute to democratic debate and an understanding of Parliament and the UK political system. It should continue its commitment to the nations and regions and promote local television services. It should continue thoroughly to train journalists and to ensure that its current affairs programming is accurate and impartial. But by outlining those duties for the BBC in the charter, we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1139"></a>

must not open the door for lobby groups to breach a fundamental rule of broadcasting; namely, editorial independence.
</p>

<a name="60314-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>For 80 years the BBC has been the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. While not perfect, on these Benches we believe that the White Paper proposals should ensure that into the digital era the BBC will continue to play an important role in all our lives.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60314-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for both contributions from the Opposition Front Benches. They indicate the broad support in the country for a strong, independent and flourishing BBC. They recognise not only the BBC&#039;s unique role in the country but the extent to which it has helped to make British broadcasting the envy of the world. With the White Paper, our intention is to continue those excellent achievements. It is clear that we face great challenges in the new digital age. We appreciate the fact that the transfer to digital for all viewers is a major operation and will take a considerable time&#151;it will be done gradually through the various regions of transmission. It is a proper obligation on the BBC to extend what has always been a universal service to all those who receive the universal signal. The intent is to create exactly the circumstances for that.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>It is also right that the digital transfer should be a broadcasting cost. Therefore, we expect help to be given to those who find difficulty through limited economic circumstances in meeting the costs of digital transfer. We appreciate that the over-75s will need additional help, as they do at present. Other categories of our fellow citizens will also need help. This is a broadcasting matter, and the BBC has always served the nation as a universal provider. It is therefore right that we have located switchover within its responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I confirm both to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who reinforced these points, that the White Paper envisages more effective competition for submission of programmes to the BBC. At present, as we all know, there is an objective of at least 25 per cent, which for independent production units has tended to be a ceiling rather than a floor. Under the new arrangements, we are determined that fresh provision will be made to guarantee that that percentage is increased. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, also emphasised the crucial role that the BBC has always played in training, given its expertise within the industry. We will expect the BBC to continue to fulfil that role, which we have identified as an important contribution to the whole industry.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The suggestion of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that the Government had not listened and taken note of the Select Committee under the noble Lord, Lord Fowler&#151;who will no doubt take the opportunity to question me further in a moment&#151;was a little <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1140"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unfair. We took note of that report and agreed with it on a number of areas, as the White Paper reflects. The report emphasised that funding should be via the licence fee and that the BBC should ensure that activities are carried out to the highest standards of probity, propriety and value for money, and we are putting in place exactly the structures that guarantee that. I recognise that there is a point of collision between the recommendation of the Select Committee and the position of the Government&#151;it was voiced in a recent debate on the governance of the BBC. However, the Government stay wedded to the concept that the trust model will preserve the necessary independence and be the guardian of the interests of licence fee payers, while at the same time ensuring that the executive functions are carried out by the executive board. We think that we have that structure right.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to Channel 4. We are seeking to carry out an evaluation of its position. There is no doubt that Channel 4 has played a valuable part in British television history. It faces new challenges in the multi-channel age, as we all recognise. We also recognise that, given its unique role in public service broadcasting, where it is not in receipt of public funds, its prospects for the future need careful consideration. That is provided for in the White Paper.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I am grateful for the questions that have been raised. Apart from on the fundamental issue of governance, I think that it will be recognised that there is considerable congruence of opinion in this House on the future of the BBC.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60314-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fowler </b>  : My Lords, I agree with what the Minister says about the high quality of the BBC, as did the Select Committee&#151;we very much included the BBC World Service in that. Does he not recognise that there is a range of controversial issues, from the two-board structure now being proposed to the costs being added by the Government to the licence fee? Is it not a fact that Parliament will be unable to change anything in this White Paper? The decisions have been made and this White Paper basically sets out a deal between the Secretary of State and the chairman of the BBC. Why do not the Government open up the process to proper parliamentary scrutiny and put the BBC on a statutory basis, as Select Committees in both the Commons and the Lords have proposed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60314-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is a fundamental point, which the Government considered very carefully, because, as the noble Lord said, not only the Select Committee that he chairs with such distinction but the House of Commons Select Committee emphasised it. In our extensive consultation with the British public, we did not find that that recommendation was supported. We must recognise the obvious fact that the public are, rightly, concerned that public service broadcasting&#151;the BBC&#151;should be independent from political interference. The problem with the concept of putting the BBC under statute is that, by definition, that would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1141"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

leave open the possibility of fairly frequent challenges or amendments to the statute being tabled, involving considerable political debate about the structure and constitution of the BBC. We believe that the public value the concept of the charter, which guarantees the BBC&#039;s independence, structure and commitments over a decade, which is something that statute could never do. Of course the Government take seriously representations from informed Select Committees, especially when the two Houses agree, but it should also be recognised that the fullest consultation took place before the White Paper and, on this crucial issue of principle, noble Lords must recognise that the public may beg to differ.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="60314-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, as a former vice-chairman of the BBC&#039;s board of governors, I am happy to welcome the White Paper and the statement in it that the Government see the BBC as a bedrock of today&#039;s media. However, I have two brief questions, given the short time available. First, can my noble friend tell me why calling the governors &quot;trustees&quot; and the management board an &quot;executive&quot; will make them, as is stated, closer to the people and more accountable? Secondly, do the Government accept the Office for National Statistics ruling that the licence fee is now a tax and that the expenditure of the BBC is therefore public expenditure accountable to the National Audit Office and, therefore, to Parliament? Or do they depend on the EU ruling, mentioned in the White Paper, that it is state aid rather than taxation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60314-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the concept of the trustee is different from the concept of the governors of the BBC. The word &quot;trustee&quot; is used because those people are in trust to the nation&#151;the nation being represented by licence fee payers. That is why there is a distinct separation between the role of the trustees and the role of the executive body, which is clearly defined in the White Paper and a product of public concern voiced over the years. I am mindful of the fact that my noble friend was vice-chairman of the BBC for a distinguished period. He will recall that, from time to time, anxieties have been expressed that the relationship between the executive and the board of governors has been too close to enjoy total public confidence in certain controversial circumstances. The new structure separates them. We recognise the ONS definition in terms of public accounting, but we do not see that that makes any significant difference to how the BBC, first, receives its money and, secondly, is accountable for how it is used.

<a name="60314-14_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we all echo what has been said about the respect we have for the BBC and its tremendous service to this nation and beyond. I would like to follow up two quick points. Citizenship and education are very good; an absolute plus. If I may say so, others on the Select Committee will agree with the idea that entertainment is to be central still&#151;maybe not over the top, but basic entertainment is part of the role. My questions are about the additional forms of help for the elderly. If we are going to be charging for spectrum, which up to now <br>&nbsp;<br>

has been taken for granted, surely it will be difficult for the BBC. Of course it has responsibility for a great deal of the switchover, but what about the business of the special extra help? I know that Ofcom has some role there.
</p>

<a name="60314-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>My second point is about online competition. As we all know, everything is being viewed on all sorts of different instruments. Online does not appear to be mentioned, so will the Minister say a little more?

<a name="60314-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. A pilot study is being conducted to look at the nature of support that some categories of licence-payers will need in the digital switchover period. To take the most obvious point, not everyone will feel able to connect up a switchover box to operate the remote control and get themselves clearly acquainted with the device that they are now possessing without help. One does not want to be demeaning at all to one&#039;s fellow citizens so I am merely reflecting the facts that not all of us are necessarily technologically well equipped and that difficulties occur. We are looking at ways in which we will be helping people. That will need to be personal help; it will be a question not just of supplying equipment but of actual help in getting people started so that they are masters of their own television receiver and can work it. We are carrying out pilot studies; there is a cost involved&#151;that goes without saying. We think that that is part of the switchover cost built into the claims with regard to the licence fee.
</p>

<a name="60314-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>On the second point that the noble Baroness identified in terms of the BBC&#039;s broader objectives, I take on her point quite straightforwardly. It is the case that the BBC in order to be fit for purpose in the new technological age has to be as quick on its feet as anyone else in terms of innovation. That is why part of the demands made in relationship to a licence fee that extends over the next decade is a recognition of the technological and research costs involved in the BBC being alert to those changes.
</p>

<a name="60314-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The BBC has a good record in those terms in the recent past. It is expected that it should not fall behind innovatory developments in broadcasting technology. In our discussions with regard on the licence fee, which will be very fraught and without doubt very forthright, there is no doubt that both the Government and the BBC will recognise that the technological dimension is of importance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has acknowledged the need to look into Channel 4&#039;s future. Will the Government agree that after analogue switchoff both the BBC and Channel 4 will be free from digital spectrum charging?
</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we have not committed ourselves to that position yet. Let me say that spectrum charging is part of the warp and weft of broadcasting at the present time. The noble Baroness is indicating that in a particular area we should make special and particular arrangements. We have not reached final decisions on that position yet. I hear <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1143"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what the noble Baroness says: with the increase of competition for those positions there is no doubt that the question of the price and charging becomes of increasing importance as the years go by.
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, one of the points that my right honourable friend made was the commitment to exclude political interference, which is basic to the future of the BBC. The role of the trustees is important and it is going to issue licenses for the running of each of the BBC services. What is going to be the basis of those licenses; will they be the result of agreements between the trust and the executive board?
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right that the service licences will be an important part of the way in which the BBC is run and also rendered accountable. We intend to make the service licenses transparent so that each service will know what is expected of it and the demands on it and the public will be aware of its obligation too. That crucial role relates to the trust in terms of the broad supervision of these licenses. They have not day-to-day supervision of programmes but agreement to the broad terms of the licence and supervision that they adhere to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Maxton: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment to the BBC and the commitment in the White Paper and to its funding by the licence fee. Although there are faults in the White Paper, in general terms we have to accept that. My concern is that there is not sufficient analysis in the White Paper of the future technological development that is taking place&#151;and will take place&#151;and the BBC&#039;s role within it. Does my noble friend agree that there are parts of the White Paper that could limit the BBC&#039;s creative and technological development by placing too much power in the hands of Ofcom?
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I do not think so. We have a proper balance between the freedom of the BBC to innovate and develop its services, the overall responsibility of the trustees and the necessary position of Ofcom when it comes to market evaluation of the development of new services by the BBC. The latter point must be right when we are looking at the interface between the BBC and commercial ventures. That is a framework within which we tend to operate. The only limiting factor to which my noble friend could point in those terms is that the BBC might obtain somewhat fewer resources for investment in the technological future because some of its services are subject to a competitive market as far as Ofcom is concerned and others may win out in that argument. That area of competition is healthy for the BBC.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, the central issues that have emerged this afternoon are the independence of the BBC and the role of Parliament. My noble friend Lord Astor said that it was incumbent on us to ensure that the BBC remained an outstanding broadcaster, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1144"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but Parliament is to have no role in that. The so-called White Paper is an announcement of a deal done between the Government and the chairman of the BBC. Parliament will have no opportunity to alter that. The Government have ignored the advice of two Select Committees about the future role of Parliament. Does the Minister really stand by his defence of his position that the British public will think that a deal done between the chairman of the BBC and the Minister is a better defence of the BBC&#039;s independence than Parliament? It is an odd view of parliamentary democracy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the public has great confidence in the BBC, which has been operating under charter, not statute, throughout its years of existence. In order to sustain his contention, the noble Lord would have to establish that there is substantial public disquiet about the inability of Parliament to hold broadcasters to account. I do not believe that there is that disquiet. The Government&#039;s wide consultation up and down the country on governance found no such demand. Instead, they found that Parliament needed a greater role in its relationship with the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60314-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>It is not as if the BBC is free from political comment. I do not think that a day goes by without some aspect of the BBC being subject to some public comment that is often highly political and contentious. So it should be in a free society. But that is different from suggesting that we should transform the BBC by replacing the charter under which it has operated throughout its years of existence with huge success, for which Members on both sides of the House have commended it, with a different structure of supervision and control, for which the case, in my view, has not been made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, the Minister kindly mentioned at the beginning of his remarks the mantra of the great Lord Reith; that the BBC&#039;s task was to inform, to educate and to entertain. The White Paper itself seemed to emphasise entertainment quite a lot. Since Lord Reith, a vast number of other channels has become available whose emphasis on entertainment is profound; indeed, any of us may see that on any day or evening. I have nothing against entertainment but, given what is available on television in general, surely the emphasis should be more on the first two of the three items mentioned by Lord Reith. The BBC has chased ratings far too much, all to prove that it is worthy of its licence fee. The Minister said that it should not chase ratings in future, but with all the emphasis on competition and so on that he referred to, I fear that that will be the bad result of this White Paper.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="60314-15_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we certainly do not want there to be an over-emphasis on ratings chasing, but I think my noble friend will recognise that the BBC is funded by all licence payers&#151;the whole of our community that watches television. It is therefore obliged to provide the fullest range of services. There <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1145"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is nothing wrong with most people looking to television for entertainment. Of course it has always been the objective of the BBC to inform and to educate since the days of Lord Reith, but the BBC has also been our most important form of entertainment for our people. It has played that role brilliantly, often producing some of the best programmes in the world in this field. Of course a balance must be struck, and crude ratings chasing would not fulfil the requirements placed on the BBC, but we are right to emphasise entertainment, and the nation is right to expect its main television producer to have regard to entertaining the public.

<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="60314-16_time0"></a><h5>5.44 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="60314-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b> 
<a name="60314-16_state0"></a> My Lords, I should like to repeat a Statement made this afternoon by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the other place.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;Early yesterday, National Grid issued a gas-balancing alert as a prudent signal to the market to further increase gas supplies. This was a planned measure and not an emergency response. National Grid took this action in response to an increase in gas demand due to the cold weather and problems on the supply side, with the Rough storage facility being out of operation and low delivery through the interconnector at the weekend. This resulted in a significant call on short-range gas storage and the resulting spike in the gas price.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;As of today, the demand/supply situation has eased compared with yesterday. Demand has fallen to near seasonal normal demand. Supply has increased, with increased flow through the interconnector. We are also seeing deliveries through the Isle of Grain, and a further shipment of LNG is due to dock tomorrow. Deliveries from the North Sea are performing strongly. National Grid expects supply and demand to balance today, and does not anticipate the system to be out of balance in the coming days. But of course National Grid, Ofgem and my department continue to monitor the situation very carefully in case of any change in the anticipated demand/supply picture.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;There is no doubt that Rough being closed is making things more difficult. Rough accounts for about 80 per cent of our total storage capacity. It can supply 10 per cent of average daily winter demand. If it was in operation, we would not be experiencing any problems this week. Members may recall that an accidental fire a few weeks ago shut the main pumping station. The damage caused is still being repaired. We are in close contact with Centrica, which owns the facility, and I understand that it will not be back in action until we are through the winter.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1146"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60314-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;It is of course normal for storage to be used during the course of the winter. We would expect the market to be drawing on short and medium-term storage in current circumstances. Indeed, that is no surprise, particularly at this late stage of the winter. We have had a spell of colder weather later in the winter, and the UK&#039;s long-range storage facility has been shut for a month. The gas system and market has responded to these circumstances.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;Let me reiterate that, on present information, we do not expect a formal gas supply emergency. Although it is clear that we must not be relaxed about the current situation, it is equally important that we do not cause unnecessary panic. The present situation does not threaten domestic supply or the vast majority of commercial and industrial supply. Even in the event of an emergency situation, National Grid will be able to maintain supplies to domestic and other key gas consumers.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;Of course, this situation has had a major impact on prices. The spot gas price has increased significantly since the weekend. I know that it is not easy for some heavy industry to make alternative arrangements, and the high prices will have an impact. The market is responding to a tight demand/supply situation, as you would expect. At these prices, gas suppliers have every incentive to maximise supply from all possible sources, and we are in close contact with the operators of the interconnector to ensure that it flows as much as possible.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;Market liberalisation in mainland Europe is a key factor in reducing energy costs for British consumers. That is why we have been encouraging the European Commission to take action, and warmly welcome the hard-hitting report it published on 16 February. We will continue to press for market reforms.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;Looking forward, a very significant new import infrastructure&#151;new pipelines, LNG import terminals and increased storage&#151;is being delivered by the private sector in the coming years. This represents some &#163;10 billion of investment. This will increase the security of the gas supply in the UK, and should reduce the upward pressure on UK prices.


</p>

<a name="60314-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;In short, we are in an exceptional circumstance in which our largest storage facility is out of action and we are experiencing an unseasonally cold spell of weather. None the less, supply is meeting demand and the market mechanisms are working, albeit at a relatively high spot price. National Grid, Ofgem and my department will continue to monitor the situation carefully&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60314-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement. This situation is very serious, and there is certainly no room for complacency where energy supplies are concerned. Second only to water and fresh air, the lifeblood of our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1147"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

modern society now depends almost totally on secure and reliable energy supplies. Furthermore, we now face hugely increased reliance on gas for both domestic, feedstock and daily electricity supplies to millions of homes.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The Statement seeks to reassure us, but will the Minister say whether it is true that we have stored only nine days&#039; gas supply for the nation? Will he also explain why the situation has been allowed to develop in this way? Why have both No. 10 and the energy Minister in another place, who frankly seems out of his depth, repeatedly told us that there would be no threat to gas supplies when there now obviously is one?
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The Statement speaks of not expecting a formal emergency &quot;on present information&quot;. Unfortunately, &quot;present information&quot; is not enough for energy planning. As, I think, my noble friend Lady Thatcher once remarked, the unexpected always happens. It is no good pleading exceptional circumstances, as in the Statement, because circumstances always turn out to be exceptional.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>In the present situation, a whole string of things have gone wrong, many of which were utterly foreseeable. The big Norwegian fields have temporarily closed, including Ekofisk; the Langeled pipeline from the Ormen Lange field and other great new gas fields is not ready; the Rough storage field has gone down, as the Minister has acknowledged; not all the LNG frozen gas has arrived; the new terminals for LNG are, anyway, not completed; the French have gone on strike and taken control of some of their LNG terminals; and the French and German power monopolies have nicked our gas before it gets to us from the continental grid, in the way that the Minister described. In addition, our North Sea gas supplies have run down sooner than expected, as the Minister now lamely admits, which is a deplorable admission; the weather has been unpleasantly cold, about which I do not know why we should be surprised; and there is a rush to gas as oil prices have soared.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Those sorts of things happen regularly. Good energy policy should anticipate them and be prepared for breakdowns on the very coldest day of the coldest year of the decade, and of the century. The new infrastructure, to which the Statement hopefully &quot;looks forward&quot;, should already be in place. The truth is that national secure energy requires market competition for its efficient delivery, but it also requires the highest degree of strategic planning. It is time that Ministers woke up to that fact, although it is getting very late in the day.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="60314-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that I will put all the blame on the French nicking our gas. That is an excellent expression, which I did not expect to hear in this House. The question was presented in another place purely and simply because gas hit 255p per therm on the spot markets. The Minister has said that market mechanisms will take their course. The gas price has dropped to 150p per therm, but market <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1148"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mechanisms are not working in the European gas market, because throughout this winter, every gas consumer in this country has paid a significantly higher price than their European cousins have paid for their gas.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Statement states that the cold weather was to blame&#151;it is forecast for only a few more days&#151;and that the interconnector was underused. That is very strange because at a spot price of well above the European average, the interconnector should have been fully operational. The fire at Rough is given as a prime reason for the jump to the spot price of 255p, but the problem with that is that the fire at Rough took place a month ago and gas supplies have met demands since then. One problem that we face is the expectation that we will run out of gas because we have produced a lack of storage and supply due to the unforeseen decline in the North Sea gas fields. But that is a real issue.
</p>

<a name="60314-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I have only a few questions for the Minister. What is the Government&#039;s view on making market mechanisms work in Europe? With the consolidation of the gas giants in Germany and France, it seems that we will face added, rather than fewer, problems. I especially question the merger between Suez and Gaz de France. What support is the Minister giving Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, in questioning that merger? It would seem very strange if that merger took place and then the EU Competition Commissioner decided that there should be a breakdown. That would cause quite a few problems. What provision is being made for next winter? It is no good crying over the position now. But, notwithstanding the gas interconnector that will come from the Norwegian fields at Easington, is the Minister concerned about the difficulties in providing added storage capacity, especially the problems with planning? Finally, what steps are the Government taking to monitor fuel poverty over this period? Many older people around the country are affected by the ramping up of gas prices from all the companies. I hope that the Minister will look at ways not just to monitor this but also to alleviate that problem.

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="60314-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, first, I shall turn to the situation that we face this winter, about which we have been quite clear since the beginning of winter. We are moving from a situation where swing production in the North Sea was able to cover fluctuations in demands for gas to one where that is no longer the case. Therefore, we need greater storage in this country. We do not need as much storage as countries that have none of their own supply, but we need more than we have had in the past. In the Rough storage field, we had something like 70 days&#039; supply, which would provide about 10 per cent of our national capacity. That is why the fire there is such an important factor.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The noble Lord said that all those events were predictable. I am not certain that they were predictable, but I take his point that one should plan, as far as possible, for a range of difficulties which occur <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1149"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1149</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

every year. We knew that if those difficulties went against us, this would be a difficult year. It would have been desirable if industry had come forward with more capacity before we got to this situation. It came through slower than we would have liked because of planning delays. We and the DTI are working very closely with suppliers to make certain that those planning difficulties do not continue.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Clearly, market mechanisms are not working in the EU, which is why we welcome the strong report from the Commission and the announcement that it is taking anti-trust action against companies. No companies have yet been named. We will fully support the Commission on its action. In December, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State urged the Commission about our concerns on the functioning of the EU gas market.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The noble Lord said that the Rough storage field did not play any part in the immediate situation because it happened in February. The situation is not simply immediate in those circumstances; a lack of storage combined with a period of sharp demand and questions of getting supply through the interconnector have come together to create this situation.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>We will continue to support Commissioner Kroes and the taking of anti-trust action. As regards next winter and extra capacity, a whole series of projects are coming through. The three main ones in 2006 are a further upgrade to the existing interconnector in Belgium, the new Langeled pipeline importing Norwegian gas to Easington, and the new BBL interconnector from the Netherlands. Two further major import facilities are scheduled to commission in 2007 and 2008.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>As always, the two major problems are industry and the impact on vulnerable consumers. Even after those further price increases from the big energy companies, domestic gas and electric prices, including taxes, are likely to remain below the EU median level. The Government are continuing with all the initiatives, such as Warm Front, which help the most vulnerable households.

<a name="60314-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with me that Malcolm Wicks is an excellent energy Minister, well respected throughout the energy industry, contrary to what noble Lords opposite said, and that he is getting to grips with changing energy policy&#151;the &quot;dash for gas&quot; that we inherited from the previous government. Is this not a third wake-up call, along with the huge increase in the price of gas and the way in which the Russians turned off gas to Ukraine, reminding us that we need diversity as well as security of supply in energy generation? Will the Minister ensure that the energy review is published as quickly as possible so that we can end this increasing dependence on gas and have a proper, diverse energy supply, including nuclear, clean coal and renewables?
</p>

is getting to grips with the issues. I strongly support his view that diversity of supply is absolutely essential. For the same reason given by the noble Lord, energy supplies and demand are extremely unpredictable and therefore it is absolutely fundamental to have very diversified sources of supply because you cannot predict in what circumstances problems will arise. The energy review is therefore extremely important and the sooner we have it the better.

Thankfully, although there is a cold spell now, that never materialised, but what on earth would have happened if we had had that really cold winter, which the Government were supposed to be warned about?

<a name="60314-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I shall deal first with the position of the energy industry. The main responsibility rests on the shoulders of industry to come forward with capacity to deal with these situations; this is not at all the problem of government in the sense that we got it wrong. The fault lies very clearly with the industry, which has been slow to put in the capacity it needs to deal with this situation. It is not a question of the Government making predictions and getting it wrong; energy industry must share some of the responsibility for our insufficient storage capacity. Where the Government is involved is in the question of planning delays, which have held things up. We have been doing all we can to make certain that that is not too much of a problem.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>If everything had gone wrong, we would of course be in a worse situation than we are in now. The Rough storage facility has been out of commission for quite a lengthy time, on top of which we have had the cold period, which has put a lot of strain on the system, but the system is coping at this level.

<a name="60314-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, the Government have now recognised that the gas supplies from the North Sea are running down more quickly than had been anticipated. Does the Minister agree that if one looks at that Statement rather more closely, one sees that the supplies from the larger gas fields seem to have been running down more quickly than was anticipated and this has not been matched by new sources of supply from the North Sea to make up for that. Do the Government and the noble Lord&#039;s own department believe that the Chancellor&#039;s swingeing tax increase on the North Sea oil producers is likely to help or hinder that situation?

<a name="60314-17_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, it has always been understood that we will see a decline in North Sea gas; there was bound to be a peak and a decline from this. We are seeing that decline&#151;it is one of the unpredictable events. I suspect that that is going faster than what people would have thought in the past.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60314-17_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, what about tax? Will the Minister answer my question?
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60314-17_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the tax situation is always the same. If you do not have tax you can probably have more supply, but the question is whether the tax was fair and reasonable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="60314-17_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not agree that the present situation has arisen because of the profligate policies of successive governments? It is not so long ago that it was estimated we would have self-sufficiency in gas and oil until 2030. Now, if we are not already failing to be self-sufficient, we will certainly cease to be self-sufficient by 2012. Successive governments, by using gas for electricity generation, instead of continuing to use clean coal technology, have landed us in this situation. Does the noble Lord also not agree that energy is far too important to be left solely to the market? Energy planning needs to be done on a strategic basis. It is not being done on a strategic basis now, and has not been done strategically for a very long time; nor will it be done so long as energy policy is merely an adjunct of another department.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I have said to the Minister many times before that we need a department of energy in this country. Will the noble Lord ask the Government to consider re-inventing the Department of Energy, which did a good job while it was around?
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="60314-17_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I would not use the word &quot;profligate&quot; to describe the use of energy supplies. The question is whether we have been relying too much on one source of energy and failing to have a more diversified energy policy. In the circumstances, given the cost of gas and its environmental impact, it is not surprising that this would become a more important part of our energy supplies.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, that you cannot organise energy markets entirely on a mandatory basis. There has to be a strategic overview. We are creating a strategic framework in which one provides incentives for, say, renewable energy and has concern about environmental impact. It cannot therefore be a free-market plan but it should be done on a strategic basis rather than on the basis that the Government have to be the producer of energy and run all the energy sources. We have found in the past that that is not an efficient system and equally is not a good way of meeting demand.
</p>

<a name="60314-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord rightly asked whether it was right to have energy policy in the DTI. We have an energy department in the DTI. It works pretty effectively and it is always an illusion that there are <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1152</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enormous advantages to be had by constantly moving departments from one area or the other. If a good job is not being done, we need to ask why and on what basis, and to put that right, rather than just shuffling things around.

<a name="60314-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, since there is time, could I just come back on that last answer on a department of energy? It is a question of priorities; I do not believe that energy has been getting the priority it deserves in the Department of Trade and Industry, and nor will it. I repeat my question: will the Minister recommend to the Government that they reset up, if that is the right word, the Department of Energy?
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Perhaps I may add that in 1983 the Commons Select Committee on Energy, of which I was a member, warned the then government not to dissipate too quickly our North Sea energy supplies, but successive governments have ignored that advice.

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60314-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord has repeated his question, perhaps I may repeat my answer. I would not recommend that. If there are things wrong with the energy policy, one needs to look at the policies, consider why we are on the wrong track and make corrections. Moving energy around between departments does not deal with the basic issue, which is whether the policies are the right ones. That is what we must focus on.

(   )   entering for any other purpose prescribed by order for the purpose of this subsection&quot;

<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, first I thank the Minister and her Bill team for our briefing meetings. They have been most helpful, as is reflected in the large number of agreements that we have been able to secure during the passage of the Bill. Perhaps she will convey our thanks to her team for their efforts.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Amendment No. 1 is grouped with Amendment No. 2&#151;in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, my noble friend Lord Avebury and me&#151;as well as with Amendments Nos. 35 and 36. I turn first to Amendment No. 1. It is probably the most non-controversial amendment that we have had and the Minister should have little difficulty in accepting our proposal. Sections 88A, 90 and 91 of the 2002 Act restrict rights of appeal against a refusal of entry clearance in respect of some visitors and categories of cases specified in an order made by the Secretary of State. Clause 4 substitutes for these sections a provision to limit all appeals against refusal of clearance and entry to certain limited <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1153"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

grounds&#151;for example, human rights and race discrimination&#151;with the exception of those in the listed categories. I welcome the fact that a right of appeal for family visitors and people wishing to join dependants in the United Kingdom is maintained.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The purpose of our amendment is to give the Secretary of State a power to restore rights to further groups should he determine that to be necessary. The amendment does not force the Government to do anything. It provides a power so that if in the future the Government determine that certain groups need to retain the right of appeal despite the points system, the right can be restored. Under the clause, rights of appeal can be restored only to visitors and dependants.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The amendment also probes the Government&#039;s intention in refusing to retain for themselves a power to restore a wider range of appeal rights, given that in debate the Minister has made much of the flexibility afforded by secondary legislation. We doubt the power of secondary legislation if it retains no flexibility whatsoever. The Minister had proposed to take a power at large to restore appeal rights under what had been new Section 88(2)(b), which it was proposed would be used for unaccompanied children. Of that provision, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State is empowered to give rights of appeal to others by order subject to the affirmative procedure. We consider it appropriate that he should be empowered to do so, and that the exercise of the power should be subject to the affirmative procedure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The Home Office memorandum making the case for a delegated power appears as Appendix 1 to the report. Thus there is no scope for the Minister to refuse the amendment on the basis that it would introduce in secondary legislation a wide-ranging power to restore appeal rights.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>It is difficult to square promises of efficiency in the decision-making process of entry clearance officers thanks to training, guidance and review with the fact that provision for all that is currently made in the Diplomatic Service procedure and yet that system does not work. Overall, the Government are not obliged to do anything. The amendment would simply provide a power if, in the future, the Government considered there to be a need to retain the right of appeal in certain cases.

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 deal with Clause 62, concerning the commencement of the Act.

ensure that the system is geared towards making such provisions as may be necessary for the operation of Clause 4. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="60314-18_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 2 tabled in my name, I, too, pay tribute to my noble friend for her willingness to listen and to consult, and for the careful way in which she has sought to engage with stakeholders to find ways of ensuring that <i>bona fide</i> international students are not deterred from coming to the UK as a result of the changes in wider immigration legislation.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The amendment is similar to one that I tabled on Report. My intention in returning to the issue is not to force the matter to a vote&#151;I should like to make that clear at the outset&#151;but rather to provide an opportunity for the House to probe the Government one final time on the shape of the proposed administrative review. Given the planned abolition of the right of appeals in entry clearance cases, this becomes a matter of central importance for me and for Universities UK, in which I declare an interest as chief executive.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Government have recognised that even under the new points-based system mistakes may well occur, so they have reiterated their commitment to introduce an administrative review scheme to ensure that, where an entry clearance decision is disputed, there is an opportunity for applicants to seek to have the decision reconsidered. Last week, the Government published their Command Paper <i>Making Migration Work for Britain</i>. It sets out in more detail what the points-based immigration system will look like.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>There is no doubt in my mind that the points-based system is likely to improve the quality of initial decision making. Some of the changes that the new system will introduce are very welcome. The emphasis on objective decision making, institution-specific visas and efforts to produce a quality-controlled register of approved education providers are all welcome. But some significant questions still need to be answered. Crucial, from my point of view, is that the design of the promised administrative review is still unclear. Indeed, I am worried that the wording of the relevant section&#151;paragraphs 52 to 54&#151;will not provide the wide scope I had hoped for, but might limit the review to a consideration only of the facts. That is a very important issue, because there is a general recognition that not all subjectivity can be removed from the process. As the immigration Minister, Tony McNulty, said in another place:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;100 per cent objectivity is a fool&#039;s errand . . . It is not about simply ticking boxes and adding points up, although that is a large part of the measure&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 20/10/05; col. 116.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I have shared with the Minister and other Members of the House, for whose support I am enormously grateful, an outline of the scheme that I would like to see. In my view, the administrative review should require entry clearance officers to provide detailed written reasons for the refusal of an application; should allow all unsuccessful applicants to request a review; should be overseen, preferably by the regional <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1155"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tier of UK visas staff; should enable sponsoring institutions to make representations on behalf of applicants; should be completed within a reasonable timescale; and should allow for the clarification of existing evidence. In addition, it is important that the entry clearance monitor should have oversight of the operation of the scheme. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on these points.
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Perhaps it would be useful if I ask four specific questions. Paragraph 53 of the Command Paper states that administrative review will be available if,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;an applicant believes a factual error has been made in the consideration of his application&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>If the Minister accepts, as I believe she does, that there will be some element of subjectivity in the process, can she reassure me that the administrative review will be able to consider judgments and points of law, as well as facts? The Command Paper states, on page 12, that the points-based system will be supported by administrative review, where appropriate. Can the Minister confirm that, as she said to me on Report, administrative review will be available to anyone who is refused a visa under the new system? Will she undertake to consult fully on the design of the administrative review and to publish the final scheme so that all parties know what to expect?
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Finally, many in this House are uneasy about the fact that, under the system as we currently understand it, entry clearance officers and their immediate managers will be responsible for reviewing their own decisions. If the Minister accepts that there will be cases where subjective judgments are involved in reaching a decision, does she agree with me that there should be an opportunity to involve a third party&#151;someone within the immigration system but not involved in that initial decision&#151;in the review? Will the Minister consider, for example, how the regional tier of UK visas staff might be involved in the administrative review?
</p>

<a name="60314-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I have shared these questions with my noble friend the Minister in advance of this debate, because this really is the last opportunity for us to secure reassurance, on the Floor of this House, about the operation of the new system during the passage of the Bill. I hope that my noble friend and, indeed, all Members of this House will understand that I have pressed this point simply because I want the system to be as fair and effective as possible. I know that that is a shared goal and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s reply.

<a name="60314-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for being as good as her word and letting us have the Home Office consultation on the points-based system before we came to Third Reading, although I obtained a copy only on Thursday evening&#151;I would have liked longer in which to study it and to consult others. A great many questions still remain unanswered, as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. I do not think that we have enough information to assess how the system is likely to work; nor do I think that anybody could have taken up the Minister&#039;s invitation in col. 534 of the <i>Official Report</i> to submit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1156"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

examples of wrong decisions made under the existing system that would not have been dealt with correctly under the new one. We have still not been told what points will be awarded, except in tier 1 and tier 2. Nor have we been given any details of the financial securities that will be required of applicants coming from certain unidentified countries, particularly those who have certain unspecified characteristics. If the Minister would care to fill in those blanks, we could see what could be done to provide her with comparators. Of course, by that time it will be too late for us to do anything about it.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Under the points-based system, decisions on entry clearance and leave to remain are supposed to be based on objective criteria only. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, has said, there is no such thing as total objectivity. In those cases where the decision is made entirely on the facts, the necessity for appeal is eliminated; we concede that. An offer from an approved institution will be a proxy for intention and ability to study, backed by the sponsors undertaking certain responsibilities for the student while in the UK. There is an equivalent duty on employers when the application is for entry clearance to work. That is, as the noble Baroness has said, a marked improvement on the present system, although as we already have a register of <i>bona fide</i> universities and colleges I still do not understand why this scheme could not have been realised in the educational sector by changes to the Immigration Rules, as I suggested at an earlier stage. In the Minister&#039;s letter to me of 23 February, she said that it could not be done until,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;the system of sponsorship is up and running and underlain by certain clearly defined responsibilities for institutions and appropriate monitoring and compliance functions within IND&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>If the institutions&#039; offer of a place is to be treated as a proxy for intention and ability to study&#151;as we agree it should&#151;what more will be required of the institutions? The new document says that pilots are running at 30 institutions, which are required to report non-enrolment or discontinuation of studies by any overseas student to whom a place is offered. I assume that this will include special provisions for recording any who drop out temporarily for reasons of ill health or bereavement, for example. Is it the intention to use this reporting system to identify and return those who use the offer of a place to gain entry for some other purpose? Do the Government have any reason to believe that, with fees at their present high levels, this is a problem? Or are the pilots meant simply to confirm, statistically, that where particular institutions offer places the students normally comply with reporting conditions and complete the courses?
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The new document does not explain how the two classes of educational institution, A and B, are to be defined, and on what criteria the number of points each will attract is to be determined. There is even greater uncertainty over how the applicant will demonstrate that he has sufficient funds to cover fees and living expenses. The document does not say so but, although an applicant is awarded points for the amount of money that he can produce up front, there <br>&nbsp;<br>

must be a subjective element in assessing whether he will be able to sustain himself for the duration of his course. With regard to the financial securities that will be required of those whose personal circumstances or migration route suggest that they present a higher risk of breaching the Immigration Rules, the Government say that they have listened to the objection&#151;raised, for example, by the NUS&#151;that demanding securities will make it harder for students from the poorest countries to come here. They will therefore require securities only where objective evidence shows that taking a particular route or belonging to a particular class means that migrant students are disproportionately likely to breach immigration conditions.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>It is only too likely that the routes in question will be taken by those from poor countries. Although the procedure may reduce the overall number of students who breach their conditions, it may also skew the overseas student population towards the richer countries. What does the document mean by &quot;personal circumstances&quot;? Is this related to the financial circumstances of the student or his family, so that if, for instance, he has no bank account or his parents are both unemployed, he will be disqualified? That is one of a great many uncertainties that remain.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>If the Government insist on introducing these financial guarantees, why could they not do so under existing rules? Rule 57(6) already requires that a student should be able to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;meet the costs of his course and accommodation and the maintenance of himself and any dependants without taking employment or engaging in business or having recourse to public funds&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>At the moment, the published <i>Immigration Directorates&#039; Instructions</i> add nothing on how to assess the applicant&#039;s ability to satisfy this condition. Here is another area where pilots under the existing rules could have allowed different criteria to be tested before the new system goes live. I would like to know from the Minister why that was not done. An objective test of the student&#039;s ability to support himself could be implemented now; it would enormously reduce the number of appeals under the existing system.

</p>

<a name="60314-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>That brings me to the question of how long it will be until the points-based system is introduced. We have an amendment to Clause 62 saying that Clause 4(1) should come into force on a date to be appointed by affirmative resolution, as my noble friend has already explained. That is to ensure that the transition is properly managed and properly monitored by Parliament. I believe that it has been said that the timing would not be the same for the different tiers. However, if in each tier the proposed tests are first applied under the existing rules, there should be no problem. Tier 1 should be extremely easy to cope with because it does not rely on sponsorship, and tier 2, for skilled migrants with a job offer, could be the next, since there is already a provisional scheme for the points&#151;as we read in the document that we have now been given&#151;which could be read across into the rules.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I have a couple of questions about the inclusion of ministers of religion in tier 2. First, would they be required to show competence in English, as in tier 1, and how would that be assessed? Secondly, although the treatment of prospective earnings as a material factor in gaining admission may be appropriate in other occupations, it is not necessarily appropriate for ministers or priests, whose value is not measured by their incomes. How will the system treat Buddhist monks who do not earn or handle money? I declare an interest as a patron of the Buddhist prison chaplaincy.

<a name="60314-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>For tiers 3, 4 and 5, it may be a long wait, which is why we on the Liberal Democrat Benches have been so desperately concerned to do something about the shocking defects that have been identified in the existing system by the previous monitor on entry clearances, Ms Fiona Lindsley, as we emphasised both in Grand Committee and on Report. We had hoped to see her final report&#151;the first draft of which she submitted before she left office at the end of November last year&#151;before this debate. The Minister told me in her letter of 23 February that the final draft was submitted in late January&#151;I believe that it has now been narrowed down to 23 January&#151;and that arrangements were being made to lay the report before Parliament. Seven weeks later and after several inquiries behind the scenes, including a personal approach to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, followed up by a letter the same day and a Question on the Order Paper, Ms Lindsley&#039;s report still has not appeared. I am very unhappy that the Government have avoided a discussion on the recommendations that she has no doubt made on improving the present system, particularly as we now hear that the new system may not be introduced until 2008, which means that we shall have to cope with all the defects in the current system for at least another two years.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Finally, I wish to make a couple of remarks about a meeting that the Chinese community had with the Minister, Mr Tony McNulty, about which I heard only just before I came into the Chamber. As your Lordships will recall, on previous occasions we have discussed the particular problems that arose with the Chinese community. I am very grateful to the Minister and her colleagues for the thorough way in which they discussed those with the representatives. However, at the meeting with Mr McNulty, the issue was raised that chefs were unlikely to have any formal qualifications. The Minister said that he recognised that chefs were not specifically addressed in the Command Paper and that it would be wrong to have a system that excluded ethnic cuisine chefs. He said that there would be a skills advisory board specific to each   sector and that the Chinese and Bangladeshi restaurant communities would be consulted on issues of experience and remuneration levels and whether the relevant job was considered a shortage occupation. Incidentally, that is where I got the 2008 date from, because that was what Mr McNulty told the representatives. We had not heard that from any other source, so far as I am aware. It is a pity that we did not know earlier that there would be this long delay before the roll-out.

<a name="60314-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The Chinese community expressed concern that the abolition of the sector-based scheme would create serious problems for the low-skilled workers category. The Minister acknowledged that and said that the solution was for them to talk to his team about the issues of remuneration, qualifications and shortage occupations. He went on to explain that,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;for the new business to the work permit system, then if approved as sponsor, will always be on the A list&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I did not express that very well, but that is how the briefing is phrased. I think that it means that every person on application would be classified as being on the A list until there was any information leading the department to think that they were not reliable employers. Again, that is something that we had not heard before&#151;that new applicants, if they had not been involved in employing people from overseas previously, would always be classed as being on the A list until there was some reason to suppose that they were not reliable. That illustrates that even at this late stage people are still discovering a great deal of the detail about how the points system will work, which we might have been told at an earlier stage to our great advantage.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>On our amendment, the best that I can do is to quote Mr Donald Rumsfeld, who said, &quot;We know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns&#151;the ones we don&#039;t know we don&#039;t know&quot;. That is why we believe that the Secretary of State should have this power. It may never have to be used if the system is as wonderful as Ministers claim, though one of the knowns is that returning residents who have been abroad for more than two years for legitimate health or family reasons may now be excluded from their homes for ever under this scheme.
</p>

<a name="60314-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>We say that it is impossible to prove that every decision will be a matter of simple arithmetic. The partial description that we have of the points system leads us to conclude&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, has said&#151;that subjectivity has not been entirely excluded. It is only sensible and reasonable, then, to have this power in reserve.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. I would like in particular to support Amendment No. 2, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. The universities continue to be extremely anxious about what the effect of all this will be on students coming to them. They appreciate, as we all do, that publication of the details of the points system is enormously helpful. We may say a little more about that when we come to Amendment No. 3. If Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are not accepted, I hope that Amendment No. 3 will be, because it seems to me a very practical way of approaching the problem.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>We need to know from the Minister the circumstances in which administrative review will be available. Will it be available to anyone who is refused? I see that the Minister nods. It would be a great comfort if she could confirm that. Will the review be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1160"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1160</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

possible if there are factual or legal errors or subjective decisions that are questionable? Some good examples have been given of decisions on whether a student can pay for a course. That will be a subjective decision and it may be that it should be reviewed. The record so far on the way in which these decisions have been made is clearly very weak. There is a lot of improving to do. I look forward very much to hearing the Minister answer those questions.

</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, I support Amendment No. 2 and commend the four points put to the Minister by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. It seems to me that a points system will reduce the scope for poor decisions by the entry clearance officer but it will not avoid judgment. It is particularly important&#151;I add this point to those made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour&#151;that the review is at least overseen by someone who was not a party to or involved in the original decision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness D&#039;Souza: </b>   My Lords, I came a little late to the discussion so I apologise if what I am about to say has already been raised. I simply want to underline the point that has been made&#151;most recently by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour&#151;that the administrative review has to be independent. Otherwise, it will not have the value that it should have.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   My Lords, I also rise to support the amendment standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Many noble Lords, from all sides of the House, have expressed concern about the planned abolition of the right of appeal for international students who are refused visas, arguing that the right of appeal is an important safeguard. Numerous examples have been given of poor-quality decision-making under the current system. We know that, last year, 33 per cent of students were initially refused visas. Of those who appealed, about one in four was successful. I was alarmed to hear about the case of a student refused a visa because the entry clearance officer did not believe it credible that if the student wanted to improve his English, Northern Ireland would be his destination of choice.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The Minister has argued that mistakes under the current system will no longer be made under the points-based system which will replace it. Although the Command Paper published last week is light on that detail, I am prepared to accept that there will be substantial improvements in the way decisions are made. However, as Universities UK and others have pointed out, the system will not be 100 per cent objective. That is why it is so important to ensure that the administrative review scheme promised by the Government really provides an adequate means of redress where mistakes are made. It cannot be right, for example, that the administrative review should consider only factual errors. Since there will remain an element of subjectivity in the process, can the Minister reassure me that that review will be able to overturn faulty judgments?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1161"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Although the Minister has said that mistakes of the kind that I have described would not be made under the new system, what happens when there is human error? After all, the judgment in the case of the student who wanted to study in Northern Ireland would not have been supported by the current Immigration Rules, and the same personnel will be making decisions under the new system. So what guarantee is there that personal prejudice will not creep in to influence the apparently objective allocation of points? After all, the Command Paper has given us no clear idea about how points will be allocated.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Another point that has caused concern is the question of who will have the right to ask for a visa refusal to be reviewed. The Minister told the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, on Report that the administrative review will be available to &quot;anyone who is refused&quot;. Is that consistent with the statement on page 12 of the Command Paper that administrative review will support the points based system &quot;where appropriate&quot;? I want to know that anyone who feels they have been unfairly refused a visa will be able to have that decision reviewed, if they so wish. Can the Minister confirm that that will be the case?
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and others, that the person with final responsibility for the review should not be the person whose original decision is being questioned, or indeed their immediate manager. An official at least one step removed from the original decision should be involved. It is disappointing that the Government have insisted on moving to abolish the right&#151;

<a name="60314-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am very sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but I think that he is making a Second Reading speech when we are now at Third Reading.

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lewis of Newnham: </b>   My Lords, I add one factor. First, I congratulate the Minister on the new scheme, which has with it the elements of a successful system. While I accept that much of the discussion today emphasises the fact that we do not know enough about its detail, I want to touch on one major factor influencing the acceptance of students when they get to the gate, as it were. That is the financial implication.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>In the University of Cambridge, we spend a particularly long period trying to assess the financial limitations and obligations on the part of both the student and the university itself. We accept&#151;as we have been doing for many years now&#151;that we will not take in students who lack the financial backing to be able to carry the scheme forward. That in itself is an important factor and I am sure that Cambridge is not unique in that respect. It must apply to other universities.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>At the end of the day, the university authorities will often have to deal with that problem themselves. They will have to try to deal with a situation as and when it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1162"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

arises, should there be a deficiency in the student&#039;s ability to pay fees. That ought to be considered. If this is a point of rejection, then it ought to be referred back, at least in part, to authorities such as the universities which have been looking into that particular situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, perhaps I may say a few words about the position of migrant domestic workers. I have not studied the Command Paper but I understand from specialised agencies such as Kalayaan and Anti-Slavery International that have that this policy seems to run against what the Home Office has already said.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Those agencies have been told by officials working on the points system that domestic workers either qualify as part of tier 2&#151;which few can do, since it requires them to have NVQ level 3 or the equivalent&#151;or will be given a maximum of six months leave, which cannot be extended. The idea is that the employer recruits a replacement domestic worker, from the UK or European Union, and sends the original worker home.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>In practice, the proposal means that migrant domestic workers would go underground. That is really contradictory when Home Office policy has been to ensure that there is no hidden slavery&#151;an abuse taking place behind closed doors, where people are hidden away. The new proposals would put domestic workers at greater risk of such exploitation. I acknowledge that there is a mention of diplomatic employees but that is a small element in the total.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="60314-20_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the Minister for the series of meetings that she has assiduously held on this Bill in an attempt to give assurances. Some amendments have indeed been brought forward, the most crucial regarding Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I shall refer briefly to Amendment No. 1 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I do not propose to speak on it today. We are at Third Reading and I have said all that I wished to say at other stages of the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I end at that point. However, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, for bringing forward her Amendment No. 2. She is right to do so because, as she says, this is the time for further clarification and our last chance to get assurances from the Government. The noble Baroness is also right to say that she does not intend to press the matter to a Division. We are all agreed that the points system must be made to work. To do that requires good will from all of us so that we get as much clarification from the Minister as possible. The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was careful in her arguments to address herself simply to the administrative review process itself. I will say one or two words about that in a moment&#151;in support of her, I hope.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, spoke he rather opened Pandora&#039;s box by taking us into a debate about the points system. I do not see that as a   problem, since at Second Reading we had no opportunity to debate that system. The Minister very constructively assisted the delay of Third Reading so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1163"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that noble Lords could put questions about the points system today. I had rather thought that it might come up in the next group of amendments, so I had stuffed all my questions in there. I have given the Minister notice that rather than double up I will ask those questions now. In a moment when I go through those questions and test the patience of the House, noble Lords will at least know that in the next group I can be extremely brief.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was very helpful to set out what she considers to be good practice with regard to administrative review. It will be important for the Minister now to go through that to say whether the Government see that the limbs of good practice that she has set out as being the ones that they wish to adopt. For example, she said that the entry clearance officer should provide written reasons for refusal. I hope that she would add &quot;in the outcome of any subsequent review&quot;, as one needs to know how the process would continue. She also said that the review should allow for the clarification of the existing evidence. I hope that one would be able to submit further evidence and, if not, on what basis that would be denied. Overall, the noble Baroness has provided the good practice guide that the Government ought to follow.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>On the issue of the Pandora&#039;s box and the points system, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, explained that last week the Government published a points-based system <i>Making Migration Work for Britain</i>. In another place, there was a Private Notice Question on that. I felt that it was not appropriate for me to clamour for that to be taken by way of a Statement in this House, because the Government had shown goodwill by delaying Third Reading so that we could debate it today. Therefore, I did not press for a Statement in this House, but it was so that noble Lords should be able to talk about the points system today.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I am grateful to Christine Lee of the North London Chinese Association for the very helpful briefing that she sent to Peers for this stage of the Bill. She makes some very pertinent points, which I would like to raise, and asks some questions that I would like the Minister to respond to. I have given advance notice of those, because they are in detail. In addition, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the fact that Ms Lee and her colleagues had a meeting today with the Minister, Mr McNulty. It would be very helpful if the Minister could give an update on that. I have been provided with a summary synopsis of the meeting by Ms Lee, but I am not sure whether the Minister has seen that yet. It may be that we are going to have to conclude any discussions about that by way of letter following this debate; or indeed it may be appropriate for the Minister to answer questions on that when this Bill is debated in another place this Thursday and it takes Lords amendments.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>On tier 3 of the points system, the Chinese community points out that it is important to know what will happen to low-skill workers. Will low-skill workers including waiters, waitresses, kitchen porters <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1164"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and catering assistants fall within tier 3 of the points system? The Minister will know that the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Chinese and Indian communities place a heavy reliance on those workers, particularly in small businesses. They point out the problem areas that arise if they have to recruit from communities that do not reflect their ethnicity, such as communication, team cohesion, training needs and deployment.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>On tier 2 of the points system, will the Minister confirm what requirements will be needed for restaurant managers and chefs to fall within tier 2? Would that include those chefs and managers with at least three years&#039; experience? The Minister will recall that Mr McNulty said categorically that chefs would fall within tier 2, but the section describing the architecture of the new system is not clear about that. It seems to set a points menu that could deny the opportunity for chefs and most managers to come here. That is at pages 25 and 26 of the Government&#039;s document.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Would it be right to say that in practice a chef would either have to satisfy a requirement that the job offer had been made in a shortage occupation, or that the job offer passes the test that the applicant would not displace a worker in the domestic UK market, plus the additional test that he or she would be earning a minimum of &#163;21,000 a year in the UK from a registered employer? I realise that some points can be earned by having a Masters degree or a PhD but, without intending to underestimate the ability of chefs, that does not seem particularly relevant to the employment of most chefs in this country.
</p>

<a name="60314-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Last week, the Minister offered me the opportunity to meet her. I raised questions about this then, with regard particularly to the test of &#163;21,000 a year as the qualifying salary. Will that &#163;21,000 be expressed merely in monetary terms, or do the Government intend to take into account benefits in kind when calculating that qualifying salary? I realise that we have asked a lot of questions today on an opening group of amendments, but I anticipate that if the Minister is able to satisfy us some of the remaining groups may pass a little more quickly.

They have been magnificent in their efforts.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I start by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that I made sure that the paper was sent to him on Tuesday 7 March as it was published, and he was invited to a meeting that his noble friend Lord Dholakia had with me and the Bill team on Thursday of last week, when we went through all the points that were raised. I apologise if for whatever reason that did not get to him or he did not get notification. As I indicated, I tried to keep my promise to make sure that noble Lords received copies as it was published, had a chance to read it, and had meetings with me and my officials to go through it. I will try to answer all the questions that the noble Lord has raised <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1165"></a>

as best I can. If I fail to do, so I will ensure that they are answered properly. I would not want anyone in your Lordships&#039; House to think that I did not try, even if I clearly did not succeed.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised the question that I want to deal with now about the independent monitor. A letter was sent to him yesterday and e-mailed, which included a suggestion that the noble Lord meet my noble friend Lord Triesman, who is concerned to pick up the points that the noble Lord raised. It has taken me a little time to achieve that because my noble friend is often out of the country, but he is very determined to support the noble Lord in the answers that he seeks on that point.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I point out as I said in the letter that the time delay in producing the report of the independent monitor is not unusual, in the sense that we need a few weeks to sort it out. I understand that there are 59 recommendations made in the report, on some of which we have to seek legal advice. I am keen that we get as much information as possible to the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60314-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her letter, but I do not accept the explanation that she gave that the officials needed time to consider all the recommendations. I do not see why your Lordships&#039; House should not be considering them in parallel with the officials, instead of after the officials have finished with them. I should like an assurance from the Minister that the report will at least see the light of day before the other place has to consider the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="60314-21_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, it is very common practice in my experience as a Minister that we are allowed as a department&#151;whatever department it is&#151;to look at the recommendations and determine our views. That is not uncommon. There is often a lot of appropriate dialogue between the organisations concerned. The few weeks that have passed do not form a substantive delay. Although I accept that the noble Lord will never accept my views on that, I have checked that this is not an unusual or unprecedented delay. I have made the offer about my noble friend Lord Triesman, and I am sure that the noble Lord will find him receptive to his points. He will deal with them far more adequately than I could conceivably do at this point.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I shall deal with as many of the details of the amendments as possible. I am grateful that noble Lords have used the occasion, as I indicated, to talk about the points-based system. Not surprisingly, I am going to focus quite a lot of what I say on the administrative review, because in a sense it is at the heart of the acceptance of the points-based system. There was general agreement in your Lordships&#039; House that the points-based system is a good thing; it is substantially better than the system it is replacing, and will enable more transparent, quicker and easier decisions to be made. This is to be welcomed. On that basis, the administrative review has an important part to play.

<a name="60314-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>On Amendment No. 1, tempting though it always is for the Government to take another power unto themselves, I intend to resist doing so. The issues that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, raised around, for example, the unaccompanied asylum-seeker children were well dealt with in Committee. We want to ensure that we capture those areas. Yet it is not right that we need an appeal system for the new points-based system coming into place. Issues that are or could be of concern about decisions will be dealt with by administrative review, so the principle of having an appeal system falls. On that basis it would be wrong for the Government to take a power unto themselves, because it would suggest either that we did not have faith in the system, or that we planned to change it, which we do not. If a new system were to be put in place, it should come to your Lordships&#039; House by way of primary legislation, not secondary, because these issues are of such great importance. Tempting though it might be, I will resist that amendment.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I turn to the commencement amendments also spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I listened carefully to what the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform said, and it made no comment on that clause. The noble Lord will know that I always do what it tells me. Had it told me to do something, I would have done it. It is also important to recognise that we have had a great deal of debate on this, and that we are keen to have a normal commencement provision in the Bill. We wish to do that appropriately. However, the debate around these issues will not end, and I will come on to some of the ways in which we plan to continue the dialogue.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>My substantive comments start on the issues in Amendment No. 2, and specifically answer the questions raised by my noble friend Lady Warwick, which were echoed across your Lordships&#039; House, especially by those involved in education. I will answer her questions so that my response will be firmly on the record, before coming to some of the broader questions. My noble friend sought clarification on four questions, and was kind enough to give me advance notice of them. I wanted advance notice to make sure I answered them properly, not for any other reason.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The first question was: if I accept that there is an element of subjectivity in the process, will the administrative review be able to consider judgments and points of law, as well as facts? We have said that we want to ensure that there is little scope for subjectivity, which I think my noble friend accepts. If a person is refused, then the entry clearance officer&#039;s letter refusing the application will set out exactly why it has been refused, referring back to the criteria for which points are awarded. That is part of our commitment to transparency. Someone who is refused entry clearance under the system will be able to apply for administrative review. The application for review will have to set out which aspect of the decision, as justified in the refusal letter, was incorrect. This encompasses both judgments and points of law, where they are relevant to the specific reason for refusal.

</p>

<a name="60314-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Secondly, my noble friend was concerned with the Command Paper saying that the points-based system would be supported by review where appropriate, and asked whether the administrative review would be available to anyone refused a visa under the new system. Yes, anyone refused entry clearance under the points-based system will be able to apply for administrative review. They have to allege that the decision was made in error on the basis of the entry clearance officer&#039;s refusal letter. We are arguing the &quot;appropriateness&quot; point to avoid people who might be being vexatious, or who should have provided evidence in their original application. On the basis that they are saying that they want a review based on the evidence provided, everybody will be entitled to claim.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Thirdly, on consulting fully on the design of the review, and publishing the final scheme so that we all know what to expect, one of the things that has become clear working with my colleagues in the Home Office, and especially with the officials, is their decision to involve as much as possible a broad range of stakeholders, including those from the education sector&#151;especially from Universities UK&#151;in the design of the detail of the administrative review programme. I hope all those invited to participate will do so fully, because this is a real opportunity. The full details of the process will be published in Diplomatic Service procedures, and will therefore be official government policy.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Fourthly, if I accept that there will be cases where subjective judgments are involved in reaching a decision, should there be an opportunity to involve a third party&#151;someone within the Immigration Service, but not involved in the initial decision? The noble Lord, Lord Laird, felt particularly strongly about this as well. We have got to look at the detail of the design of the system, but I accept that in some circumstances there may well be good reason for a person outside the management chain to be involved, whether at regional or national level. As my noble friend will agree, we had a good meeting with some of her vice-chancellors last week, and discussed this at length. We talked about the different circumstances that could exist where one might wish to look outside. Noble Lords will not be surprised that it is particularly relevant in financial issues. For example, we considered areas where there might have been substantive issues of fraud or other kinds of financial irregularity. That might well be such a set of circumstances. I am committed, and have committed the Home Office, to there being such circumstances, though we hope to determine what precisely they are in discussion with stakeholders. The expertise that stakeholders can bring is critical to determine that.
</p>

<a name="60314-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>There will be such circumstances, but they will be limited, because our ambition is for a transparent system. If a mistake is made, it can be overturned quickly&#151;quickly enough that the person is not affected in their desire to come either to work or to study in this country. It will be quick, but where circumstances seem appropriate&#151;in a clearly defined way, working with colleagues in the university <br>&nbsp;<br>

sector&#151;there will be the potential for that to be the case. I hope that gives my noble friend the strongest assurance that I can give.

<a name="60314-22_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   My Lords, to clarify one point, my noble friend said that the administrative review scheme would be set out in Diplomatic Service procedures. My understanding of those procedures is that they are published and become effective at the same time. Is it possible that the procedures might be published in draft, so that we could look at them in advance, prior to them being published and made effective?
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="60314-22_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I will commit the Government to doing that. There is no problem in doing that at all; it would be positively beneficial. As my noble friend will realise from our meeting with the vice-chancellors, there is a lot of expertise and experience, from both employers and the universities, that we want to tap to ensure that we capture the system appropriately. This may be the last Home Office Bill I ever do, but I have no hesitation in committing to that.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I shall deal with the other issues that have been raised, particularly education. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked what would be required of institutions as sponsors. Yes, sponsors will be required to report attendance. Also, visas will be granted for specific institutions, so in a sense they will be tied to that institution. Most of the institutions that have been in discussion with colleagues at the Home Office welcome this, because it gives them a greater degree of certainty. Yet there is an issue that needs to be thought about, and again there are discussions going on. We must find some way to be notified when a student has arrived but is believed to have disappeared&#151;not that they are unwell, but have disappeared. That is important for immigration control, and officials are working with institutions to make sure that we are able to deal with those responsibilities appropriately. There is a general agreement that that is a good thing, as long as we get it right and do not make it onerous.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Those institutions that conform with their responsibilities can expect to be rated A, and those where we find a less good record will be rated B. That will encourage the Bs to become As, we trust, in the way that they approach it. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, identified the system from the Command Paper, and I will not repeat that at this point.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>On the point of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, about domestic service and slavery, which he linked, we have provisions in the Bill to prevent illegal working. We are concerned to ensure that, wherever possible, labour market needs are met from the UK market and the EU, as the noble Lord will know, so I cannot say anything specifically to him about how we might address that, except that the Home Office takes it seriously. Perhaps we can pick this up later. It should not necessarily hold up the Bill, but it certainly needs to be looked at so that we identify the problems clearly, as he has.

<a name="60314-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, raised issues about the Chinese community in particular. I note that they met with my noble friend today; I was grateful to receive two copies of the notes of that meeting. I was clearly looking puzzled, as I had not yet seen them. I have not yet had a chance to read them, but I believe it was a constructive meeting and hope it will have addressed some of the concerns raised along the way. I shall try to deal with all the points of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I hope that she will leap up if I miss any.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>First, there is the question of the &#163;21,000, and what is taken into account. The noble Baroness was helpful in our earlier discussions as to what these issues might be. Indeed, members of different communities have talked to us. On benefits, the obvious example is that somebody comes and is given accommodation, perhaps not only for themselves but for their family, and would therefore expect a lower salary. For the UK, I always think of those involved in the Church, who receive a smaller salary, but get their accommodation provided. That is also true in certain professions across the world of employment. There is a plan to find a way to allow those allowances to be taken into account, but the noble Baroness will accept that we do not want to see that as a substitute for paying people properly. There is a balance to be struck between recognising that people should be in receipt of a proper wage, and recognising the benefits. That balance is being looked at.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The skills advisory body which will be responsible for monitoring sector shortages in all areas of the economy needs to take into account&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="60314-22_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Chester:</b>  My Lords, will the Minister pick up a question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about members of religious orders who enter on a completely different basis from the stipend which a minister of religion might receive? It is good to know that the benefit in kind of housing will be taken into account in assessing the value of the overall package provided, but religious orders are international bodies. There is considerable movement between them. This applies to all the different religions. There may occasionally be problems with religious leaders being imported from elsewhere. Can the Minister give an assurance that that point is also taken into account in the points-based system?
</p>

<a name="60314-22_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry but we are on Third Reading. I am not going to play Committee at this stage. I was of course going to address the point of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I will do it precisely now, and try to guess what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, might have been saying to me. But I will try to stick to the rules, because we want to get through the rest of the groups of amendments.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, had two questions. One was about the English language skills. There will be an expectation that an appropriate level of English will be spoken. As the right reverend Prelate rightly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1170"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

said, there are issues over earnings. I am referred by my officials to paragraph 95 of the Command Paper, which makes clear that we will amend requirements to enable these categories to enter. We will not expect ministers of religion to meet the usual minimum salary requirements under tier 2, for exactly the reasons that the right reverend Prelate would expect.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The skills advisory body will be able to draw on the Skills for Business Network, and would ensure that bodies representing the ethnic cuisine sector should be engaged with their relevant sector skills councils. We want to ensure&#151;it is a theme throughout the Bill&#151;that those involved in small businesses, whether in the provision of the wonderful food that I love to eat or in any other small business, have opportunities to talk about the skill sector shortages within their area appropriately. We take that seriously.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>We also recognise, thinking about chefs in particular&#151;again, a theme running through the Bill&#151;that some skilled workers do not have paper qualifications. There is a trade-off within tier 2 against salary. I have already identified that, within salary, we would also take into account benefits and qualifications. In general&#151;and this generality is not specifically relevant to the particular sector in question&#151;a higher salary tends to suggest that someone is at an appropriate level of skill for tier 2. That will not always be the case, partly because of extra benefits and partly because of the area. As a generality, however, it is true.
<a name="time_24"></a>
<a name="60314-22_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>On lower skilled workers under tier 3, we obviously expect a lot of our requirements to be met either within the UK or the EU, but tier 3 schemes will be set up if it is clear that there is insufficient labour to meet demand. They would be quota-based, operator-led, time-limited, subject to review and from countries where we have a returns policy. Waiters, kitchen porters and others will fall into tier 3 only if the scheme that encompasses them is established. In general, we expect domestic and EU labour to be sufficient for these positions, but we will of course keep this under review to ensure that&#151;again, in conversation with the skills sector council&#151;we have clarity over what might be required.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>On the question of chefs and managers with three years&#039; experience and whether they fall within tier 2, the precise model is not finally determined; that is partly because there are still conversations to be had, particularly with small business and those involved in particular sectors. We are hoping to end up with a system where, in the round, people who fail to have points in one area&#151;because they do not have paper qualifications, for example&#151;will get points in another area&#151;because, for example, their salary level is higher&#151;so that we end up with a balance. We have more work to do, working with our stakeholders, on getting that balance right. The Command Paper makes it clear that we would seek to do that. But that is basically how we would seek to do it, not least because it gives us a clear, transparent system where people can <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1171"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

identify for themselves that they have got the right number of points before they apply. That is particularly relevant to the education sector, though not exclusively. One of the issues I hope will be addressed by the new system is that people will know that they have got the right number of points, and will therefore apply. It may cut out those who wish to exploit the system, an issue that we are concerned about for some countries. It also ensures that we increasingly get successful applicants, because they know in advance that they are able to apply. That would be of great value.
</p>

<a name="60314-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>We cannot make the required changes under rules only, because we need primary legislation first. I seem to remember answering that question a couple of times before. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will feel that I have addressed it. I think I have addressed Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 35 and 36, so it is time for me to sit down. I hope on that basis that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="60314-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation. I have been reminded by my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie that I should not make another speech, having already spoken. I shall resist the temptation, and simply comment on some of the issues that the Minister has raised before withdrawing my amendment.

</p>

<a name="60314-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>I was disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to listen fully to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, on the grounds that&#151;we were told&#151;he was making a Second Reading speech. This is the first time we have had the opportunity to discuss the points system. It is right that we should have discussed it fully, and I do not think the Second Reading excuse is the right one in this case. Let us hope that there will be another opportunity, particularly in the other place, where there could be a fuller discussion on the basis not only of the Government&#039;s own document but&#151;I very much hope&#151;of the report of the independent monitor, who obviously has made observations on this matter. When the Home Office publishes that document, it will be clearly demonstrated whether an administration review is needed. If the independent monitor is satisfied, we need not take the case further, but I suspect that the independent monitor has made the type of comments that makes an administrative review very important indeed.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The Minister referred to the appeals system. If appeal rights are retained under Clause 1, why is that not possible under Clause 4? We have been told about the points system. That system, or any system, can be effective only if it has proper means of review at various stages. I do not believe that any system can be foolproof, which is one reason why we strongly support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>My second point relates very much to the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. The Minister has given an explanation in relation to the concerns of the Chinese community and other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1172"></a>

communities in a number of meetings. Let us hope that that can be monitored over time to see that it does not have an adverse effect, especially when we consider the substantial contribution that such communities make to the economy.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The Minister has rightly explained how the system will work, especially in relation to some of the concessions in the type of administration review that we are looking for. We shall certainly examine it carefully. Obviously there will be an opportunity to put questions to the Minister in the future. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>

<br>
(b)   must specify the number of those applications refused;

<br>
(g)   may record opinions.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_174"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I tabled a similar amendment on Report, when the Minister said that the Government were minded to accept the principle behind the amendment but that it was technically incorrect in its drafting. I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the opportunity to use the resources of the Home Office Bill team to have it redrafted in a more appropriate form. I put my thanks to the team on record.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The drafting that the Home Office Bill team came up with fully meets the objectives of the amendment that I tabled last time. It is important for Parliament to have the guarantee that it will have the chance to hold the Government to account for the whole system of administrative review of applications for leave to enter the UK to study or work&#151;in other words, a chance to review the operation of the Government&#039;s new points system to which we referred in the previous group of amendments. There is also the chance to review the abolition of appeals against refusal of a visa for work and study.

</p>

<a name="60314-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The amendment requires the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament within a period of three years that kicks off as soon as the Government bring Clause 4 into operation. I chose a period of three years as being what I hope is an appropriate target time, as I want Parliament to be able to review the following matters: <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1173"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

first, how the phasing in of the points system is working; secondly, how the training of the entry clearance officers is improved; and, thirdly, how they are coping with what should be a more objective way of allocating visas. The Government have said previously that they expect a roll-out to tier 1 in the next 18 months and then they may go on to tier 2. The Minister gave us further information about the roll-out time today.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The Government will have to put in place training and guidance of allocation on points very early, otherwise it will not work. I expect that a debate after three years of the scheme should give a fair reflection of concerns and, one hopes, the successes of the new system. If we had to wait until the scheme has been fully rolled out, we might have to wait for so long that it would be too late to make suggestions about improvements to it, and the rot might have set in, so it is important to get early intervention. As I say, we hope that it will be successful, but experience means that a lot of tweaking always has to be done. I hope that my amendment will give the chance for that tweaking to take place at the right time.
</p>

<a name="60314-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The amendment would require the Secretary of State to set out an extensive range of information in the report, including the number of applications made in the period under review, the number refused, and the number granted after initial refusal was reversed as a result of further consideration by the administrative review procedure that the Government had put in place. I hope that proposed new paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) will give Parliament the opportunity to debate more generally how the system itself is working, and the reactions to it of both the users and the staff operating the system, including the views of the entry clearance monitor. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="60314-23_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, I endorse what my noble friend said. Anyone who has used a points system&#151;many of us have in different contexts&#151;knows that they can produce hugely helpful results, but also distortions and unfairness as different human beings operate the same system in different ways and places. It seems extremely important that it be possible to look at the system after not too long; three years may well be the right time. My noble friend has suggested the aspects that should be looked at, and I am encouraged by what she said to think that the Minister may accept the amendment. That would be wonderful. The universities would be pleased if that happened. I hope that we hear that the amendment will be accepted.

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="60314-23_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on tabling the amendment to secure a review after three years. Many outside this House have been grateful to her for her representations of their concerns. I fully support the amendment, which would give the House an opportunity to return to issues that have clearly been of some contention, and to consider them in the light of experience. I agree with her that the collection of better data on the number of refusals will be central to ensuring that, should any problems emerge with the new system, a management information system is available to help us address issues as they arise.

On the basis of reports being available, we could then determine what further action was necessary to strengthen the points system.

<p><a name="st_182"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I dedicate this amendment to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. I am delighted to see her back in her place. The noble Baroness rightly put me on the spot suggesting that the fabulous word &quot;effluxion&quot; was perhaps not in keeping with the Government&#039;s or my stated aim of using simple English where simple English will do. Parliamentary counsel watched me squirm and recognised, as he said, that this was not a term in common usage. Therefore, I propose that we take out the word and insert &quot;passage&quot; which tells everyone what we seek to do, with grateful thanks to the noble Baroness. I beg to move.

<a name="60314-24_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, it is wonderful for a fleeting moment to feel that one has not lived in vain. I thank the Minister very much for causing the provision to be changed. It was a slight flaw in the Bill. It is a great improvement. I am very grateful to her.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60314-24_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the Minister for listening to what was said in Grand Committee about the use of the word &quot;effluxion&quot;. I can only hope that the parliamentary draftsman has made a note to substitute &quot;passage&quot; for &quot;effluxion&quot; where it occurs in other statutes and statutory instruments, except perhaps where reference is made to the exercise of options as in the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, or the expiration of tenancies or licences as    in the Utilities Act 2000, or of contracts of employment as in the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998. It has something of a pedigree in those contexts but I am not sure whether it is necessary to use such an arcane word anywhere if &quot;passage&quot; fits the need here.

&quot;(   )   Before an order can be made under subsection (2) the Secretary of State shall consult with employers likely to be affected by the code of practice and shall take account of the results of that consultation.&quot;

<p><a name="st_186"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I have tabled this amendment to enable the Minister to meet a commitment which she gave on Report that the Government would provide noble Lords with an updated draft of the code of practice regarding the civil penalty for employers. I am grateful to her office for sending me a copy of the latest draft which was published on 6 February.
</p>

<a name="60314-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I understand that there are four main changes which reflect issues that we raised during our debates in Grand Committee. I should be grateful if the Minister could highlight those points for the assistance of other noble Lords, but in particular for those who will read in the future a record of these debates.

</p>

<a name="60314-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I should also be grateful if the Minister could address a couple of points raised by the Commission for Racial Equality in a Third Reading briefing that I received from it last week. First, it remains concerned that civil penalties and repeat checks on certain employees subject to immigration control could be divisive and is not in the spirit of race relations legislation; and that civil penalties may make employers less likely to employ legal migrants or anyone, including UK-born ethnic minorities, perceived to have an immigration issue.
</p>

<a name="60314-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Those points were raised properly at Second Reading. Reflecting the further briefing received last week, my question is this. What work do the Government intend to carry out as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent to address these concerns and resolve any unintended consequences of the introduction of the civil penalty? For example, do they have plans to set up regular meetings with the CRE to monitor any problems? The second issue it raised refers to the fact that Clause 23 states that the Secretary of State must consult the CRE and consider representations before placing the code of practice before Parliament although the code of practice can be laid before the House with or without modifications to reflect the representations. The CRE points out that it is unclear how the new code will relate to the 2005 CRE statutory code of practice on race equality and employment. What work are the Government now doing to see how the two codes will be reconciled before they place the code of practice before Parliament? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="60314-24_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, we support the amendment requiring prior consultation with employers on the code of practice and factors to be considered in setting the civil penalty. As part of the points system, we have already a range of employers, the TUC, the CBI and others to consult on how the points system can operate to identify the needs of this country. It is equally right that they should be consulted in terms of the liability which may be faced by employers in this matter. The Commission for Racial Equality is right in drawing attention to its own code of practice and how we make sure that the system is monitored regularly and that the report as to how this affects employers generally is available independently of the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="60314-24_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving me the chance to make sure that we have on record the issues which have been raised. I believe that it has been made clear as we have brought the Bill through your Lordships&#039; House and another place that there will be a full, detailed public consultation on the illegal working measures proposed. It is not necessary to create a statutory requirement on the Government to consult as that is done as a matter of course whenever options are being considered for new regulations on business. The consultation will be undertaken in accordance with the better regulation executives code of practice on consultation which sets out the basic principles for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1177"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

effective government consultations. Therefore, the consultation will last for a minimum of 12 weeks. The responses will be analysed with particular attention paid to possible new approaches to the questions consulted on, further evidence given on the impact of the proposals, and the strength of feeling among particular groups. A report including a summary of responses received during the course of the consultation will be produced and published at the end of the consultation and a copy placed in both Houses and published on the IND website. We followed this practice in relation to the legal working measures in the 2004 order and will make sure that we do the same now. I hope that we have made it clear that we are receptive to comments made during the passage of the Bill. The same spirit will apply to the consultation exercise.
</p>

<a name="60314-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The draft code of practice under Clause 19 was initially published in October. It has been revised and republished in the light of comments made in Committee. It contains the following changes: a revised definition of illegal employee to reflect the government amendments tabled on Report in this House in relation to cancellation, curtailment and revocation of leave; it explicitly states that consideration of the fairness of the financial penalty to be imposed must be made by the Secretary of State together with the proportionality of the amount; that if objection to a civil penalty is made the Secretary of State must consider evidence as to the effect of the civil penalty on the viability of the employer&#039;s business; and it explicitly states that consideration will be given to requests from employers that payment of a civil penalty may be made in monthly instalments over a period of 12 months. As I have indicated, the draft code will be subject to full public consultation and may well be amended further in the light of the results of that consultation.
</p>

<a name="60314-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I turn to the issues raised by the noble Baroness regarding the CRE. The CRE had sight of the original draft before it was published. We welcome its active participation in the consultation exercise, in particular over compatibility issues between Clause 23, the code and the 2005 CRE statutory code of practice on race equality. For example, the CRE might need to think about whether it needs to amend its statutory code in light of the Bill. We discussed with the CRE the fact that civil penalties were coming before the code was published. I hope that there will be a chance now to consider that again. It is a member of the illegal working stakeholder group chaired by my right honourable friend Tony McNulty. We shall work with the group on the implementation of civil penalties, thereby ensuring that it is indeed participating fully. We shall work with it in the industrial tribunal system and researches to monitor compliance with the statutory non-discrimination code.
</p>

<a name="60314-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I hope that that meets the commitment I made and that on that basis the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

(a)   a person who fails without reasonable excuse to comply with a requirement imposed under section 32(2) or 33(2) by a constable in England and Wales or Northern Ireland otherwise than in relation to a reserved matter (within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998) shall not be treated as having committed the offence in Scotland (but has committed the offence in England and Wales or Northern Ireland), and

<br>
(i)   shall not be treated as having committed the offence in Scotland, but


<br>
(ii)   shall be treated as having committed the offence in England and Wales or Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_192"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to ensure that Clause 34 does not breach the Sewel convention. As noble Lords will be aware, Clause 34 makes it an offence to fail to comply with a police request for passenger, crew, service or freight information under Clauses 32 or 33. Carriers will commit an offence unless they can prove that they had a reasonable excuse for not supplying the information. Passengers and crew members will also be guilty of an offence if they fail to provide information to the carrier without reasonable excuse.
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>To comply with the Sewel convention, the police in Scotland can only require passenger, crew, service or freight information for police purposes that are or relate to reserved matters within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998. The police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland can require passenger, crew, service or freight information for any police purposes. The reason for this difference&#151;I am conscious that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, are present in the Chamber&#151;is that police powers are in general a matter devolved to the Scottish Parliament
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>A concern has recently arisen that Clause 34 is insufficiently clear as to whether a passenger or crew member who refuses to provide information to a carrier in Scotland in response to a request from a police constable in England, Wales or Northern <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1179"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Ireland for police purposes, would have committed an offence under English or Scots law. If the request had been made for police purposes, which would, in Scotland, not be police purposes in relation to reserved matters, and the failure to comply was an offence committed under Scots law, this would mean that a UK statute would be creating an offence in Scottish law in relation to matters that are not reserved&#151;namely, general police purposes&#151;thereby breaching the Sewel convention. This amendment seeks to put the matter beyond doubt.
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>With that rather technical explanation, which is necessary for <i>Hansard </i>purposes, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="60314-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I think that I am right that Clauses 32 and 33 implement an EU directive under which carriers will have to notify the authorities of passenger details of all flights ending on EU territory, which is similar to the arrangements in place in the US. These powers are being extended to domestic flights starting and ending in the UK under Clause 9 of the Police and Justice Bill. I would be grateful if the Minister could say whether this procedure of amending one Bill in another when both are going through Parliament at the same time has ever been adopted before, and why it was necessary to do that in this case. It could not be that the Government decided that it was necessary to have information about domestic flights only when this House had already considered this Bill on Report, because the Police and Justice Bill was published on 25 January.
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Whatever the explanation, if the carriers have to provide PNR information in advance, any failure on the part of the operator to comply with Clause 32(2) or Clause 33(2) would be inadvertent, and the operator would have a reasonable excuse. The data might not have been entered, or there might have been a fault in the software, and the penalties would not bite. On Report, we referred to my noble friend Lord Carlile&#039;s strictures on lax security at small airports, as reported at col. 565, and the Minister slid out of answering that question directly by saying that there were resource implications of using these powers to monitor all flights at all airports. She then wrote to my noble friend Lord Dholakia on 23 February to say that under the e-borders programme, the request for PNR information would be made for all scheduled and charter flights and all cargo services arriving in or departing from the UK. I presume that, under the Police and Justice Bill, that is now to be extended to domestic flights. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether the operators have been consulted on that, and whether they have agreed to these new requirements.
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>On Report, my noble friend Lord Dholakia also raised the question of rendition, which took the Minister by surprise. She did not appear to grasp the relevance of what he was saying to the question of how passenger information might be used to prevent or deter serious crime. Since then we have learnt from Adam Ingram&#039;s reply to my right honourable friend the leader of the Liberal Democrats that at <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="60314-25_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, forgive me, but at Third Reading it is pertinent that the noble Lord refers to the amendment and not to a debate on the substantive issues of either that clause or other clauses that might be relevant to the Bill. We should stick to the procedure. I am perfectly happy, as he surely knows, to debate issues of substance outside this House, but if he wished to return to this issue, he could have tabled an amendment, to which I could have responded fully at Third Reading.

It would be extremely important to know whether the CIA flights, referred to by my noble friend Lord Dholakia, would be covered by the provision; if so, the persons who operated those flights would be subject to the penalties in the Minister&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="60314-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Surely I am also entitled to refer to correspondence that has taken place since Report between the Minister and my noble friend Lord Dholakia, which we could not have discussed previously and which arises directly from this amendment. I was going to say that, in her letter to my noble friend on 23 February, the Minister said that under the Chicago Convention we have the right to search aircraft of other contracting states and that we have not and will not approve of the transfer of individuals through the UK to places where there are substantial grounds to believe that they would face a risk of torture. We would not assist in any case where to do so would put the UK in breach of international law, including the convention against torture.

<a name="60314-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I only wish to ask the Minister, if I may, whether, since we now know of these flights, the police will require the CIA to provide passenger information using the powers of Clause 32(2), considering that unless there is another, more convincing explanation than we have had so far, there may be grounds for believing that persons on these flights are being <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="60314-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, my understanding of the amendment is that it simply puts right the problem of a United Kingdom Bill that uses police powers when policing in Scotland is a devolved matter. The process that the Minister has had to go through to put this right seems quite elaborate. Perhaps the Government should consider whether they can in some way alter the law in general, so that when this matter crops up in other Bills, such an amendment does not have to be made. I should think that it is possible to amend the Scotland Act 1998 in such a way that it covers future Bills. This matter will crop up all the time as the police operate across the UK, particularly on terrorist and asylum matters.

<p><a name="st_203"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in this group of amendments we return to the question of who should be authorised to arrest, detain and search passengers arriving at United Kingdom ports of entry, or the juxtaposed control force at Calais and Dunkirk, which began operations on 1 March 2004, and in Brussels at the Gare du Midi, Paris, Lille and Calais Fr&#233;thun, for passengers on Eurostar, since early 2004. Your Lordships may recall that we expressed particular concern about the delegation of those powers to private contractors at the juxtaposed controls, in particular, where the person exercising the power will be a foreign citizen subject to foreign laws and to only intermittent oversight by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Children&#039;s Commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>When the Chief Inspector of Prisons appeared before Sub-Committee F of your Lordships&#039; European Union Committee on 1 February, she said that she had just produced a report on the Calais arrangements. She did not know what others were envisaged, but she had the power to inspect Calais and had just done so. Will the noble Baroness confirm that the chief inspector and the Children&#039;s Commissioner have the power to go into all the other juxtaposed control points that I have mentioned?
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The chief inspector went on to say that she did not believe that there were sufficient measures in place to take account of the special needs of children in terms of the decision to detain, the effect of detention or removal and what happens afterwards. She expressed the view that the Children&#039;s Commissioner also had concerns about the treatment of children and what happens when they are removed.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>The chief inspector says that she is not satisfied with the arrangements for Calais and that she has not looked at them anywhere else. So I think that we were justified in raising those concerns both in Committee and on Report. We understand that the Children&#039;s Commissioner has been to Calais and that he has been in touch with his French opposite number. Is the noble Baroness satisfied with the arrangements made for vetting staff to be employed by private contractors?

held at Roissy airport in January 2005 and, just last month, she received a letter from the Collectif de Soutien d&#039;Urgence aux R&#233;fugi&#233;s about the plight of unaccompanied children from abroad in Calais. Previously, we spoke about the controls at Calais, but there are other places in France where there are juxtaposed controls. In addition, we should not overlook the Gare du Midi, in Brussels, where completely different arrangements may be in place. We know nothing about whether there is a Children&#039;s Commissioner in Belgium or whether there are arrangements for ensuring that people employed at the Gare du Midi are subject to sufficient controls as we would see them in England.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The Minister said in her letter to me of 23 February that, since the control over who accesses the UK control zone in northern France is solely a matter for the UKIS, we would extend the right of access to the Children&#039;s Commissioner. I repeat the question: do the Children&#039;s Commissioner and the chief inspector have the same rights in the other control zones in France and Belgium?
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The Minister also said in her letter that the code of conduct applying to contractors&#039; staff with those powers would be the same as it is for detention custody officers, but that code was part of the operational policy standards and procedures, which are agreed between the contractor and the detention services, which,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;follow the principles of PACE but cannot be placed in the public domain for reasons of commercial confidentiality&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I want to challenge that statement; this is an additional reason why we are wary of the use of private contractors. We do not agree that commercial confidentiality should be used in that way. As long as those services are carried out by public servants, we know what code of conduct they must observe but, now that the operations are being privatised, the code is secret and we must rely on a general assurance about the principles on which it is based.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The exemption of information provided in confidence to a public authority under Section 41 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is not absolute. It can be overridden under Section 2 if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption, as it manifestly does in this case. After all our debates in which concern has been expressed on all sides about the use of private contractors to arrest, search and detain people, including children of any age, whether accompanied or not, I cannot imagine a clearer case where the disclosure of information would be more essential if confidence in the proposals is to be sustained. I invite the Minister to reconsider the matter in that light, giving her notice that, if necessary, I will take the matter to the Information Commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The fact is that neither Parliament nor the media nor NGOs will be able to scrutinise what happens in France or Belgium, and it is not likely that if there are irregularities members of the public will draw our attention to them, as often happens in this country. The magnitude of the powers being given to private <br>&nbsp;<br>

contractors to deprive people of their liberty is being acknowledged by making the exercise of those powers subject to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, although it would be a resourceful complainant who discovered the existence of that right and managed to log a complaint during the short time for which he would be detained.
</p>

<a name="60314-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, commented in Grand Committee, those are powers more extensive than those that Parliament gave two uniformed community support officers under the Police Reform Act 2002, after what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor described as a long and hard debate. This is too far. I beg to move.

<a name="60314-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I moved a rather similar amendment previously, on the basis of a letter that I had received from the Public and Commercial Services Union. The union appears also to have written to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and a copy of its letter appears in its 11th report of this Session. It is concerned about a loss of professionalism.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>It is on that point that I wish to speak. Although I have deep reservations about contracting out to private operators of any portion of what is a very important public service, the desire of the union to maintain the professionalism of the service is very important and could be met by Amendment No. 8. I ask the Minister to consider that carefully, because the union has something important to say in the letter that had already been before the Committee when I spoke to it earlier and in its submission to the Joint Committee on Human Rights.

</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="60314-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I have added my name to the amendment. Before I come to it I would like to say to the Minister that she was unable to guess what was in my mind in the course of the first group of amendments. Perhaps I may briefly say to her that it was the point of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about competence in English for people seeking visas to enter this country. That point is well known to the Home Office and is extremely relevant to imams of the Muslim faith who are imported to this country to hold particular posts here. It is important because they need to be able to relate to the authorities and to society in general and they need to be able to advise their faithful on how to relate. I hope that that point will not be overlooked.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 8. This is the first time that we come to the important point of a drafting nature about the Secretary of State acting only when he is satisfied. We will come to it again later. It avoids the sloppy drafting about the Secretary of State being required only to think. Having said that, the noble Baroness will appreciate that the amendment brings in only modest differences from what is with us in the Bill&#039;s existing text. The important thing about it from a practical point of view is that it provides a safeguard for what happens when persons who may be vulnerable adults in the language employed by the UNHCR&#151;or they may be children&#151;are found in the course of searching ships, aircraft and vehicles.

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I am sure that the whole House will remember the terrible incident at Dover when a lot of Chinese people fell out of a lorry having been frozen to death or suffocated. Very awkward situations can arise, which is why a high standard should be required of those who are undertaking such tasks. Finally, as far as I know the Government have given no reasons for a lowering of the standard to be expected of the people undertaking these tasks. So on all of those grounds I trust that the amendment will commend itself to the Government.

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="60314-27_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 standing in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. The effect of the two amendments is to maintain the status quo as regards arrest, detention and search of individuals in these circumstances. Among those individuals will be some of our most vulnerable children, as noble Lords have said and as the Minister emphasised in her comments at earlier stages. It is vital that the officers involved are adequately equipped and checked to manage the children with sensitivity when they are found.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The amendments are tabled to assist the Minister to fulfil the undertakings she previously made to consult on the matter and to report on those consultations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="60314-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for raising the issues. I could not agree more about the principle of having high standards. That includes, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said, making sure that people are competent and understanding about dealing with children. The noble Earl and I discussed that point earlier today: they are potentially the most vulnerable children.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>I turn to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about an earlier amendment. I read his mind sufficiently to have obtained the answer but I did not read it out, which was a fundamental flaw in what happened. As he said, it was about ministers of religion in tier two being required to show evidence of English language skills. They will have to speak an appropriate level of English. That is a requirement. I apologise; but at least I got 50 per cent of the way there, if not the whole way.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I do not accept Amendment No. 8 because it is not necessary. We have already said that the Secretary of State has to consider each individual&#039;s level of training and suitability before issuing authorisation. The certification in a sense does not add anything to the process but I take what is underneath the amendment to be the opportunity to talk again about some of the principles within the legislation. We have to begin from an understanding that we are not delegating responsibility for these activities and the proposals will ensure that the borders receive additional resources. The operation of the UK border remains in the hands of the UK immigration authority. Noble Lords will recall that we spent some time on Report and particularly in Committee talking about the fact that it is possible to consider certain jobs to be carried out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1186"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by people outside the Immigration Service and the type of expertise that will be necessary. That led us in a sense to being sure that we had the right level of expertise within the contract being given out by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and ensuring that we do not hand over responsibility to private contractors. We retain responsibility and people are properly trained and understand the functions and roles with which they will be concerned.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>That is a fundamental part of what is being considered here. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised issues about language, which I will address before I come to talk about children. If the person detained does not speak English, they will be transferred to the offices of the UK Immigration Service, where there are facilities for the language line&#151;a 24-hour translation and interpreting service. So their needs will be met in that way. Equally, a contractor who is brought in must be able to speak sufficient English to be able to converse with the officers of the UK Immigration Service, under whose supervision they will operate, and to be able to carry out their functions properly. It is inherent in the requirement that you have to be fit and proper for the purpose.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>We talked in Grand Committee about the strict safeguards that will apply to the recruitment and the work of the contractors. These include security checks, which will be undertaken in both the UK and France. The training will include cultural awareness, race relations, the legal framework, interpersonal skills and care for vulnerable detainees, including&#151;perhaps I would say especially&#151;unaccompanied minors. The French police will screen all contractors who work on the post, and will check criminal records, including those for sex offences. As noble Lords know, no freight searching is envisaged anywhere else other than at Calais port. There is no freight at the Gare du Midi, so that is not relevant in this context.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the inspection carried out by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the statutory right to inspect places of detention. Of course there is a statutory right there. The Children&#039;s Commissioner does not have a statutory right, but would be welcomed. In fact, an invitation has already been issued to him. He has not, to my knowledge, been to Calais. I will check that; I am pretty certain that he has not been, but he is invited to visit to have a look at what is going on there.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I also indicated on Report to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, that my honourable friend Tony McNulty would meet the Children&#039;s Commissioner to discuss these clauses, and he has done so. The Children&#039;s Commissioner wanted further information, which has been sent to him. We have also invited him to view the Immigration Service, as I said, and to look at the care of unaccompanied children at Heathrow Airport, which may be an area of particular interest.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, I told him in a letter that we will not award any contract to private contractors until the Bill is ratified, but we want to identify a contractor through an open and fair competition that will require any potential bidder to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1187"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

submit references and their work-related history for verification. We further propose that a contract will be awarded on the same basis as that issued to detention custody officers. Firms will have to operate in accordance with their operational policy standard and procedures that are agreed with the IND&#039;s detention services department.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>I note what the noble Lord said about what I said about commercial confidentiality. It is very common practice to retain commercially sensitive information, and we will of course put all that we can into the public domain. The noble Lord will probably know that I have responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act in my department, so I am very familiar with Section 2 and some of the issues that it raises, as well as with Richard Thomas, who does a sterling job as the Information Commissioner. I am very happy to talk further to the noble Lord about this, but I am clear that commercial confidentiality is always relevant. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right that that lends credence to his view that it should be kept in the public sphere, but we are trying to be as open and transparent about the work that the contractors will be doing. We are trying not to usurp the work of the Immigration Service or to de-professionalise the work of the professionals, but to recognise the particular functions that can be undertaken within a very clear set of guidelines and to a clear contract. Expectations will be high, and I think that we can reassure the noble Lord that there will be absolute clarity about the vetting of each individual. We will continue to talk about that because of my particular interest in freedom of information.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I take what my noble friend Lady Turner said about the Joint Committee on Human Rights. There is no desire, as I have said, to have anything other than a very professional service. I believe that by bringing in contractors to carry out particular functions, we can professionalise the service even more by allowing those who need to concentrate on particular issues and particular aspects of the work to do so more effectively.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I want to devote a little time to talking about children, a subject which the noble Earl and I have returned to over the years, often late at night; indeed, we will return to it later in our consideration of the Bill. I have been very grateful for the noble Earl&#039;s time. It is important to ensure that we give careful consideration to issues involving children. As I said to the noble Earl, the Immigration and Nationality Department has the Children&#039;s Champion, which is new. We will ensure that the contractors&#039; training is appropriate and that children who need support from social services get it as quickly as possible. These children could be very vulnerable. If they are unaccompanied, they may even try to run away, and we will ensure that people know how to handle them properly, that we lessen their fears, and that they get the proper support as quickly as possible. We will involve the Children&#039;s Commissioner, as we have sought to do already, but, as the noble Earl and I discussed a few hours ago, I am conscious, as he pointed out to me, that the Children&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1188"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Commissioner has a huge amount to do, so we will do this sensitively and in collaboration with him so that he feels he has the right level of information and involvement.
</p>

<a name="60314-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I make a commitment that I will keep the noble Earl in touch with those issues and that we will consider any questions that need to be further addressed. I absolutely commit that the Government are very alive to the sensitivities, especially around children, that have been raised. We want to make sure that this contract is awarded properly; that there is transparency to ensure that that is the case; and that we are very sensitive to ensuring that this job is done well by contractors, thus enabling the professionalism of the Immigration Service to continue within and under their control. I hope that that will enable the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60314-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her assurances, which, to some extent, repeated those that she has already given. But she went beyond them in two respects, for which I am grateful, particularly that the Children&#039;s Commissioner would be welcome at any of these points abroad. He will no doubt want to take that up in due course. The noble Baroness reinforced what she had already said about the training of staff. It has occurred to me to wonder whether training in Calais Frethun would be in French or English. She said that anyone who did not speak English would be transferred immediately to immigration control, so that the language line would be employed. I do not think that we knew that before. If I understand the noble Baroness correctly, although persons other than the Immigration Service could arrest someone, as soon as they discover that that person cannot speak any English, they would not have the continuing power to detain which is provided for in this clause. Responsibility would have to be handed over the Immigration Service, so that the language line could be used.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her offer of further discussions on commercial confidentiality, because I think that it is bogus to say that the code of conduct, which, as already has been said, equates with the PACE code of conduct in terms of principles, would in any way jeopardise the commercial rights of the firm concerned. The inference that I draw is that if the code was in the public domain, someone else could copy it. Surely, if that were the case, emulation between different contractors who are bidding to carry out those services would mean that higher standards would ultimately be achieved. Either that or the code of conduct is sufficiently constrained by the necessity to conform with the PACE principles. There would be no distinction between those that were drafted by different contractors providing these services. We are not asking for everything to be disclosed, only the code of conduct, which it is very reasonable to request bearing in mind the enormous importance of the code of conduct to the treatment of vulnerable adults and children.

<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Minister will recall that we were going to discuss Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 on Report. Unfortunately, there was insufficient time, and the Minister and the Whip agreed that this matter could be raised at Third Reading. Again, there was ample discussion on this matter in Committee. I do not intend to elaborate much on that, other than to express our concern. Perhaps these are the most serious items in this legislation.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a> Our concern is that when taking a decision to deprive someone of a right of abode or citizenship, the highest standard of test must be established, rather than a lowering of standards. We have been greatly assisted in our amendment by the briefing from the Immigration Law Practitioners&#039; Association. The purpose of the amendment is simply to retain the current test for deprivation of citizenship; that is, having done something which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK or a British Overseas Territory. To date, the Minister has coupled denials that this is sufficiently broad with examples that fall fairly and squarely within it. The consequential amendment is necessary because line 20 becomes the first reference to the British Nationality Act 1981 in the Act.

</p>

<a name="60314-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Amendment No. 13 would apply to the new powers to deprive people of the right of abode the same test as is currently used and we suggest should continue to be used for deprivation of citizenship. That effectively means the existing test of having done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK or a British overseas territory. This meets the criticisms of the clause that were voiced by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Further, this amendment will take out the subjective test involved with the phrase &quot;the Secretary of State thinks&quot;&#151;this came up in an argument earlier on&#151;and replace it with the phrase &quot;is satisfied&quot; as for deprivation of citizenship. The Bill contains &quot;is satisfied that&quot;, even in the rare clauses that do not    amend previous legislation, for example Section 33(2), 33(7) and 36(5). Any suggestion that this is mere plain English is obviously treated by us with extreme caution. I beg to move.

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have had on these amendments which I tabled on Report. As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, they were not taken because it was rather late.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The amendment to Clause 56 would preserve the current law that a person has to do something seriously prejudicial to UK interests or an overseas territory before being deprived of British citizenship. As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, explained, a similar amendment is proposed on the deprivation of the right to abode.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The effect of Clauses 56 and 57 if they are not amended is that the Home Secretary need no longer be satisfied that an individual has done something seriously prejudicial to UK interests. He needs only to believe that deprivation is conducive to the public good. This is a much easier test to satisfy and is drawn from the test which must be satisfied in order to deport a person, subject to immigration control. A further effect could be that such a person could be stripped of citizenship and thereafter be at risk of deportation. This is a very serious matter for the individual concerned.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The current test for deprivation of citizenship has been in force only since April 2003. Why is it necessary to make it far easier now to deprive individuals of citizenship? This drop in the standard of protection needs to be understood in the context that deportation itself is the most severe form of removal from the UK. The order remains in force after a person has been lawfully removed and prevents a person from returning lawfully until such time as it is revoked. This is a very important issue and it is not good enough for the test to be too general and subjective, which it is at the moment.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Similar arguments relate to the removal of the right of abode. I do not intend to make a long speech as we are at Third Reading, but I hope the Minister will seriously consider my comments or those of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, because, for the individuals concerned, these are matters of extreme gravity.

<a name="60314-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness is aware, the current wording that we have in our law follows that of the European Convention on Nationality 1997. The case for widening the power of deprivation so that it can be exercised when the Secretary of State considers it would be conducive to the public good has not been made out. The proposed test is one which has been used to deport or exclude foreign nationals since the Immigration Act 1971. The Government are equating migration control with deprivation of citizenship. We think these things are completely different.

On 19 January in Grand Committee the Minister referred to the effect of this clause on Abu Hamza before he was convicted. However, the <i>Companion</i> makes it clear that the <i>sub judice</i> rule would have applied equally if it had been after his conviction while he still had a right of appeal. I have been personally warned in writing by the Clerks not to refer to a particular case under consideration by the courts, so I wonder whether the Minister sought the leave of the Leader of the House to refer to Abu Hamza under paragraph 4.58 of the <i>Companion</i> or how otherwise she justifies the reference she made to that particular case.
</p>

<a name="60314-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Perhaps I may leave that and make a general comment. First, when a person has been convicted of a very serious offence and an extradition warrant in another jurisdiction has been issued against him, is it a matter of immediate concern whether by depriving him of his citizenship we can send him back to his country of origin? Secondly, if incitement to murder and to racial hatred is not contrary to the vital interests of the United Kingdom, then what is? The use of this wording has never been tested in the courts, but the Minister has said that she knows of cases where the behaviour of dual citizens is not a danger to the United Kingdom, but is nevertheless completely unacceptable. In other words, the Government would interpret the power in new Section 42 as allowing them to deprive someone of his British citizenship on a subjective assessment of his behaviour, whether criminal or not. That is indeed how they have always used the powers to deport under Section 3(5) of the 1971 Act. A person I know was arrested on terrorist charges in September 1985 and was acquitted after two trials and 15 months in custody. He was then deported in December 1986 using the 1971 Act powers. We do not want that type of kangaroo justice extended into the area of citizenship.

The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, was absolutely right to describe these deprivations as very serious matters. Personally, I would much prefer to see such action being taken only after the grounds for taking it had been considered by a court.

<a name="60314-29_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. He has implied that I may have said something inappropriate. I did not check with the Leader of the House and I am told by the Clerks that the rules governing <i>sub judice</i> do not apply to Bills, so the rule would not apply in that context. Further, in everything I say I ensure that I am given proper legal advice. If the noble Lord wishes to pursue whether I have behaved inappropriately, he is of course at liberty to do so. I recommend that he takes it up with the Leader of the House. However, as I was referring to a particular case where the powers that exist were being used and had been dealt with in 2003, I do not think I am in breach of anything. However, the noble Lord will make his own mind up about it.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I agree with all those noble Lords who said that citizenship is seen, rightly, as a fundamental element of national and individual identity. We do not grant British citizenship lightly; nor do we contemplate deprivation of British citizenship lightly. The present criterion, referred to by noble Lords, is that the person has done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an overseas territory. It is a very high test. When noble Lords invited me to indicate how often it had been used, I indicated that it had not been used because it was indeed a very high test. Our experience, on looking back over cases from the past two or three years, is that the test is too high and the hurdles too great.

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>There are people living here who are&#151;or have been in the past&#151;war criminals, radical preachers and other activists who seek to provoke others, as well as those involved in serious and organised crime. Their activities are incompatible with the holding of British citizenship and their presence here is very much against the interests of this country and its people. For example, an individual involved in the large-scale trafficking of young women from eastern Europe for prostitution would not be covered under the current test, but could be under the test we are proposing. We are concerned that the holding of citizenship precludes the exclusion or deportation from the United Kingdom of such people. They are very few in number, but are none the less significant. We have various measures we can take against them. Our intention, of course, is to prosecute wherever possible, but we should also consider our options under immigration powers and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Where one of these people holds citizenship, we will consider its removal to enable other actions, such as deportation or exclusion, to be pursued on the basis&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said&#151;of their dual nationality. Replacing the currently seriously prejudicial test with a conducive test would greatly facilitate our ability to deprive of citizenship and enable other effective action to be taken. That is the basis upon which we have put forward the proposals within this legislation. As I have indicated at previous stages of this Bill, the Government takes its responsibilities in this area seriously, and we believe it <br>&nbsp;<br>

is right that the changes should be made. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

It was my intention to divide the House on this particular matter, but neither the Government nor the Opposition Benches would forgive me if I were to do so at this late stage. I do not intend to go any further other than simply to say this to the Minister: having attended some of the citizenship ceremonies that are being held up and down the country, I wonder if the Minister could give some thought not only to telling people what citizenship is all about, but also how citizenship could be taken away when they are disloyal to this country? I think we can put that argument forward in order that people are aware of their obligations and duties. I do not think we will get any further. The Minister has been kind enough to give a lot of leeway in a number of previous amendments. In light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 14 I will speak also to Amendments Nos. 17, 19 to 24, 26 and 30. This is a rather complicated set of amendments, although the arguments for them are really quite simple. The justification for the amendment is that it attempts to exempt babies, certain categories of minor and British nationals without the right of abode, from the good character test in applications for registration by entitlement. Clause 58 allows for the good character test to be extended to applications for registration as a British national. Currently this is applied only to naturalisation applications.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Registration by entitlement recognises that there are certain people who have a right to become British under nationality law. Naturalisation, on the other hand, is only ever discretionary. The distinction between the two is therefore important. To import a lower standard of good character removes that distinction.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>People who will be affected in the main by the clause are minor children under 18. However, no justification has been advanced on public policy grounds. The good character test here goes far beyond terrorism. Although in appropriate cases there may be justification for denying someone British nationality, the good character test is too wide for that justification. A more appropriate power would in that event be that of &quot;seriously prejudicial&quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Sections 3(2) and 17(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 and Article 6(3) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 all concern entitlement to registration for babies within 12 months of the date of their birth. The Minister said in Grand Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;Concern has been expressed that we would extend the rule to very young children or even babies . . . Of course, the rules would state that that would be a silly thing to do, and it would not happen&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/1/06; col. GC 279.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Sections 1(3), 1(4), 15(3), 15(4) and 17(5) of the British Nationality Act 1981 all concern registration by entitlement of minors. I welcome the Government&#039;s amendment to the effect that children under the age of 10 should not be subject to the good character test under this provision. We shall debate that amendment later. However, it appears none the less that babies born to British parents overseas who would have to register within one year of birth as British still remain on the face of the Bill, even though other categories of babies have been deleted from it. That does not make much sense. In order to be consistent the amendment proposes that that category is deleted from the Bill also.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Although I welcome the Government&#039;s amendment I nevertheless remain concerned that children as young as 10 will be subject to a good character test. These minors have an existing right that is recognised under nationality law to become British. There is no justification for them to be subject to a good character test. We are concerned that a case might arise of a teenager brought up in the UK for some years who is unable to register on the basis of entitlement because of having received an ASBO or attended a public meeting deemed to be glorifying terrorism or some other subject. We seek assurance on that point. Children who have been troubled teenagers are not automatically bad adults or bad citizens. I beg to move.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;In assessing whether any previous criminal activity would affect a person&#039;s ability to meet the good character requirement, we would take into account the nature of the offence, the age of the offender and the length of time that had elapsed since conviction.

</p>

<a name="60314-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I once had a case where the applicant was a bank manager married to a Swedish citizen. They would go home every summer to her parents in Sweden for the holidays&#151;it was a regular occurrence. This person had an international driving licence, which he renewed while in Sweden. The question put to him by the interviewing officer with respect to his application was, &quot;Have you ever applied for a British driving licence?&quot; He said that he had, but that it had not been convenient for him to take the test, which was why he continued to rely on the international driving licence.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>When, after persistent and relentless inquiry, I persuaded the Home Office to tell me why the man&#039;s application for citizenship had been refused, I was told that it was because he had dishonestly pretended that he had taken the driving test in the United Kingdom&#151;but he had done no such thing. There may have been a difference of interpretation in what he had said in answer to the questions, but he was quite definite in asserting that he had never taken the test and never said that he had&#151;and that he had told the interviewing officer that he continued to rely on his international driving licence. A triviality of that kind denied him citizenship, although, when he applied again three years later, that was overlooked.
</p>

<a name="60314-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Do we really want that kind of test to be applied to those that this clause concerns? I believe that the age of 10 is not an appropriate one to have in the Bill, although it is better than where we started. I wish that the Minister had made a little more effort to look at the arguments that older children&#151;up to the age of 18, as we believe&#151;should not be subject to this test.

<a name="60314-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, it is interesting to discuss what is in the eighth group before what is in the ninth, as I would like to have dealt here with the amendment that I have put forward.

</p>

<a name="60314-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>We believe that it is right and proper, in general, that we should be able to say that those who have engaged in drug dealing, paedophilia or war crimes&#151;those who are guilty of such serious crimes&#151;fail to meet a good character test, in order to exclude them from the granting of nationality. That is important, which is why we have put these clauses in the Bill. The proposed alternative&#151;that the Secretary of State must grant registration unless satisfied that the applicant has engaged in conduct &quot;seriously prejudicial to&quot; vital state interests&#151;does not capture the group of people whom we might wish to. It raises considerably the threshold for refusing registration from that currently <br>&nbsp;<br>

being proposed. As I have indicated, it would not allow us to refuse an applicant who had engaged in serious criminal behaviour, much of which would fall short of what could be described as actively or &quot;seriously prejudicial to&quot; vital state interests. For that reason, I will not be able to accept Amendments Nos. 14 and 17.

<a name="60314-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I am not sure whether Amendments Nos. 19, 20, 23 and 24 would do what my noble friend Lady Turner intended. What they actually do is make acquisition of nationality at birth, by foundlings and on adoption conditional on good character. I think that that is exactly the opposite of what my noble friend is seeking to do. In other words, she does not want to bring in a good character test for those children at all. I am not accepting the amendments because, as my noble friend is indicating, she does not actually want to do that. Unfortunately, that is the way those amendments are worded.

<a name="60314-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also raised the question of those who are over the age of 10, an age that we will deal with in the next group. My noble friend described the issue of troubled teenagers; I accept that one has to put into context the matter of young people who have perhaps had issues. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about those who have perhaps had anti-social behaviour orders. It is relevant to consider that there are young people who may have committed quite serious offences with whom we would wish to engage in terms of considering good character. I do not accept the premise that a 17 year-old or a 16 year-old is not responsible. That is where we come to the age of 10.

provides that any person who is a British citizen and who has no other nationality and has not renounced any other nationality should be entitled to the same benefit as those who were covered earlier in the clause. They would not have to satisfy the good character test.
</p>

<a name="60314-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>Amendment No. 28, to leave out paragraph (d), would exclude people who register under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 from the good character test. I will not go into the arguments that have already been discussed today about the inappropriateness of subjecting a person who is solely a British national and is <i>de facto</i> stateless to a good character test in order to acquire British citizenship. Is it lawful to impose such a requirement on applicants for citizenship in the light of our obligations under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness? British national overseas status, like the status of British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons, does not carry the right of abode anywhere. A British national overseas, who is not Chinese, will automatically lose the right of abode under the Hong Kong immigration ordinance if he ceases to be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong and has   been absent for a continuous period of more than 36 months after obtaining settled status in any other place.
</p>

<a name="60314-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>As your Lordships will be aware, being settled in a country with no time limit on your stay does not amount to nationality or citizenship. Even in Britain, we have numerous long-term residents who are unable to obtain British nationality and can be removed at the pleasure of the Secretary of the State, if he thinks it conducive to the public good. Like the vast majority of British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons coming under Section 4B of the 1981 Act and ordinarily resident outside the UK, the group of persons covered by Amendment No. 28 are solely British and have no entitlement to any other nationality. It is a contradiction in terms for somebody who is already British and holds solely a British passport to be refused citizenship of this country.
</p>

<a name="60314-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>There is one other important point to be considered on this amendment. In the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, we extended what was then termed a &quot;cast-iron guarantee&quot; to the solely British ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They were told that they would be admitted to the United Kingdom and would have an entitlement to register as British citizens. It is a disgrace for us now to renege on a commitment that we made to this group of solely British people.

<a name="60314-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Amendment No. 33 is of a different nature altogether. I would have asked for it to be degrouped had I not realised that it had been put with this group only when I came into the Chamber. As a matter of form, I wish that the groupings of amendments could be issued by the Government Whips&#039; Office somewhat earlier in the day than was the case today. I know that that is not a matter for the Minister, but now it is on the record. I see the noble Lord, Lord Grocott. I do not know whether he heard what I said, but it would have <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been convenient to have had the groupings much earlier than we did, instead of having to look at them just as we came into the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60314-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>This amendment seeks to bring British nationals overseas into Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. It follows the amendment that we tabled at an earlier stage to achieve the same effect by removing the &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; requirements of the 1997 Act, but I hope that your Lordships will agree that this present drafting is clearer and more elegant. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, by inserting a new Section 4B into the 1981 Act, gave otherwise stateless British nationals the right to register as British citizens as long as they were solely British and irrespective of where they were resident. When the Home Secretary announced in July 2002 that he was tabling an amendment to the then NIA Bill, he said that it would &quot;right a historic wrong&quot; that had left stateless tens of thousands of Asian people who had worked closely with the British colonial administration. Fiona Mactaggart, who is now a Home Office Minister, said that the coming into force of Section 4B meant that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;the most racialist underpinning of Britain&#039;s immigration and nationality laws is about to be swept away&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 5/11/02; col. 147.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>In enacting this amendment, we will remedy the limbo status of probably the last remaining group of solely British nationals who have no other nationality or citizenship, who have not recently and deliberately given up another nationality or citizenship and yet who do not come under the provisions of Section 4B of the 1981 Act despite having no entitlement to acquire the citizenship of any other country. The group in question are solely British nationals overseas who were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong on 4 February 1997 and can never satisfy the requirements of the 1997 Act. Consistent with the policy that all otherwise stateless British nationals without the right of abode in the United Kingdom should have the entitlement to register as British citizens, this small group of people should be entitled to do so, too. They hold only British passports, their sole identity is British and yet they do not have the right to reside in any British territory.
</p>

<a name="60314-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>We have a strong obligation to this group of people under the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, Article 10.1 of which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;Every treaty between Contracting States providing for the transfer of territory shall include provisions designed to secure that no person shall become stateless as a result of the transfer. A Contracting State shall use its best endeavours to secure that any such treaty made by it with a State which is not a Party to this Convention includes such provisions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong made specific provision for the indigenous Chinese population of Hong Kong to be recognised as Chinese citizens. Despite our convention obligations, it made no provision for the non-Chinese, solely British ethnic minorities of Hong Kong to acquire proper citizenship. That was made clear by the current Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, who, on 30 January 1997, said that,
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>I know that the Minister has considered this matter and that she did not see the force of the arguments that we put earlier. However, I hope that she will be convinced by what I have said this evening and agree to this amendment. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="60314-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for again putting forward his views on this issue and for recognising some of the work we have done.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>We are not suggesting in what we are doing that people cannot come, but it is appropriate to use the good character test for the reasons I gave in response to the previous set of amendments. It is important to be clear that there are people who have committed serious crimes&#151;examples of which I gave earlier&#151;who we might wish to prevent gaining British nationality.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>To deal with the issues raised, our starting point was that we should not apply the good character requirement to those whose entitlement to registration derives from a provision of the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The Government then additionally agreed to exempt from the good character requirement those seeking to register as British citizens on the basis that they are already British overseas citizens, British subjects or British protected persons and hold no other nationality or citizenship. They have not made a general exception for all such nationals or for all such stateless persons. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment, as he has indicated, would introduce such a general exception, and the effect would be far reaching, since a significant proportion of those able to apply for registration are people who have some other form of British nationality. This is in direct conflict with the Government&#039;s commitment to seeing that the vast majority of those seeking to register are of good character.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>As to the amendments relating to applicants under the 1997 Act, and British overseas nationals in general, these groups invariably have a right of residence in Hong Kong. Indeed, applicants under the 1997 Act are required to have been &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; there on particular dates&#151;a concept which, while not necessarily equating to possession of a right of permanent residence there, at least implies lawful and, for the time being, stable residence in Hong Kong.

</p>

<a name="60314-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>In 1997, those with only British nationality were told that they would be admitted to the UK if conditions deteriorated in Hong Kong, not that they would be given British citizenship. I do not believe that we have reneged on the agreement that we reached. British overseas territorities citizens normally have the right of abode in the British overseas territory from which their citizenship derives. By contrast, the right of many of those eligible for registration under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1201"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1201</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Section 4B of the 1981 Act to remain in their counties of current residence is at best precarious. It was this lack of a secure residence in any country that prompted the Government to announce on 4 July 2002 their intention to introduce a provision now having effect as Section 4B, and which at Report stage prompted us to move for their exemption from the good character test, which was welcomed.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>We do not accept the position of those qualifying for registration under the 1997 Act, or of British nationals in general is sufficiently close to that of persons presently entitled to registration under Section 4B of the 1981 Act to justify the support that the noble Lord&#039;s amendments clearly seek. Nor do we accept obligations towards stateless persons going beyond those we have accepted by ratifying the 1961 convention. It is always sad to disappoint the noble Lord, but I believe that the Government have the balance right. While wishing to continue to raise these issues, I am sure that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="60314-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be relieved to hear that I shall not go over the registration point again, but I wish to take issue with her on the last amendment and what she said about the rights of abode of people other than those covered by this amendment. She said that they were precarious and that that was the reason for including them in Section 4B. I do not agree with her. Apart from the case of Idi Amin, which was some 38 years ago, the other persons whom she says have only a precarious right of abode in the territories where they reside are in fact secure. I cite the people who live in countries such as Malaysia, for instance. It is a functioning democracy with rules of human rights. It will not suddenly kick out people who have a second-class British nationality.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>The noble Baroness said in a letter that she wrote to me the other day, for which I am most grateful, that there was a difference between the people that we are seeking to bring into Section 4B and all those other groups who are now enfranchised, as it were. I investigated whether there have been any other cases since the days of Idi Amin, when British citizens have been kicked out of a territory where they had what the Minister calls a precarious right of abode. I could not find any. If the noble Baroness has evidence of that, I shall be delighted to hear it. It is not a matter that we can pursue this evening, but once again perhaps we can put it on the list of unfinished business that she and I can discuss when the Bill has gone to another place. In the meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;IMMIGRATION SERVICE: WELFARE OF CHILDREN

<br>
   In section 11(1) of the Children Act 2004 (c. 31) (arrangements to safeguard and promote welfare), after paragraph (m) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(n)   a regional office of the National Asylum Support Service;


<br>
(o)   the centre manager of an immigration removal centre;


<br>
(p)   the Chief Immigration Officer at a port of entry.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_234"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I shall endeavour to be brief at this late hour but also to do justice to the matter. Perhaps I may refer to the debate on contracting out for searches. I omitted to underline the importance of ensuring that Home Office monitors are properly equipped and trained. Perhaps the Minister will write to me on that point.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The amendment places a duty on various elements of the Immigration Service to give regard to promoting and safeguarding the welfare of children while performing its functions. I emphasise the duty to give regard. It is a soft duty which is already on the police service and Prison Service and does not interfere with their primary function.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>I apologise for raising the matter at Third Reading. It does not fit the criteria we have been advised to accept. I hope that noble Lords will understand the unusual circumstances. At a late stage of the Bill, the Children&#039;s Commissioner and the Chief Inspector of Prisons gave oral evidence to Sub-Committee F of the European Union Committee. The sub-committee deals with home affairs. They expressed considerable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1203"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerns about the welfare of children in the Immigration Service. That prompted me to table an amendment on Report.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her time in discussing the matter today and for the hope which was offered at that meeting. I refer to Yarl&#039;s Wood as an example where things have not been working. In doing so, I pay tribute to the men and women who work in that institution. The concerns are no reflection on their good will and the wish to do the best for the families detained. It is a reflection on the quality of thinking underlying the establishment of the facility just over a year ago. Improvements have been made but they have been slow and there is still a long way to go. The lack of partnership between the detention centre and local social services and the connection with those making decisions in the Home Office were identified as matters of serious concern by the joint chief inspectors in their report on safeguarding children. I hope that the amendment will contribute to addressing such an issue in future.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>I recognise the immense difficulty that the Government face. Some noble Lords may have heard Mr McNulty this morning on Radio 4. It is an extremely delicate and difficult matter. In the report by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, on the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, a deputy manager of social services said that they lost their ability to be social workers because of the time they had to spend dealing with asylum seekers. There were no additional resources to cope with it. One must seek to manage migration in a sensible way and avoid too much pressure on scant resources in certain areas.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The Minister expressed concern about the legal implications and the implications for the successful removals of failed asylum seekers and irregular migrants. I hope that the legal opinion I gave her yesterday and circulated somewhat late to noble Lords&#151;I received it only this weekend&#151;may reassure the noble Baroness. It is a mild duty. She has a concern about education, in as much as a child being educated in this country might be removed to a second country that has a poorer education system, and the amendment might be used to resist that removal because a child should not be given a poorer education. That point is already covered by the European Convention on Human Rights. There was a case involving the prevention of the removal of a child. It focused on primary education. That case, the Holub case, was not accepted. I emphasise that this is a duty to give regard&#151;a very weak duty in terms of judicial review.
</p>

<a name="60314-31_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>In conclusion, I apologise once again for bringing this difficult matter back at Third Reading and I hope that noble Lords will appreciate the circumstances. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment, or at least give an undertaking actively to review the area, look at guidance and see whether that might be improved. I look forward to her response.

with us on a number of occasions. He was also kind enough to let me glance at the legal opinion that he had in his possession. He has expressed repeatedly his concern about the welfare of children, particularly in relation to immigration, detention and the National Asylum Support Service. I hope that the Minister will take serious note of his concern and see how the matter could be kept under constant review, so that the case of children is not forgotten.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="60314-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister say in her reply whether she has had sight of the distinguished counsel&#039;s legal opinion that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, was kind enough to copy to my noble friend Lord Dholakia and me, which contradicts the Minister&#039;s repeated assertion that if the amendment were passed the immigration system would become unworkable? I wonder whether the Minster has had time to study that. If she has not yet done so, could she do so and convey further advice to her colleagues in another place, who will have to consider the matter in further detail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="60314-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I was happy to put my name to this amendment when approached by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. Of course, he is quite right. The National Asylum Support Service should be obliged to have regard to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. That should be part of its duty. I hope that we will have a sympathetic response from the Minister this evening.
</p>




<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="60314-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am breaking my vow of silence on the last six groups to contribute on this matter. I do not want to give the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, any hope that I would support requesting the Government to accept the amendment, but it is right to bring it back on Third Reading. This is one of those occasions when there is justification for further assurances to be sought from the Minister, because of the developments that have taken place during latter debates on this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>As I said on Report, this is an important matter because it affects directly the question of how the welfare of children is to be safeguarded and promoted when they are in contact with immigration services. The noble Earl&#039;s amendment highlighted what I believe is a significant tension between the policies of protecting children as set out in the Children Act 2004 and policies that require the speedy removal of those who have sought asylum here but have not been granted leave to remain. As well as policies that govern the treatment of those children caught up in non-asylum cases, we also have those in relation to asylum cases.

</p>

<a name="60314-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I must say that that is a tension that I have found impossible to resolve in my discussion with my colleagues with other departmental responsibilities. So, admirable although the intentions of the amendment are, within the context of the Bill, it is impossible to make progress. However, the underlying issues need to be addressed by us all in future. We need to continue to challenge Home Office policies on that, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1205"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

even when we do not oppose them, to make the Home Office think how it is to take forward the welfare of children within the immigration system. I would be grateful if the noble Baroness would let us know whether it is being considered that one way forward could be to have cross-departmental work on the matter. That is often a proactive way forward, where one gets key people who have real enthusiasm for something to happen in departments to work together, so that we can try to reconcile the principles and contradictions between the Children Act and the responsibilities of IND.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>It would be useful to know what action the Minister for Children has taken and will take on the matter. If the noble Baroness is undecided on the matter, I should be happy if she were to write to me. That is something that we need to consider in future.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>As a result of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, bringing forward the amendment at our previous stage, I immediately tabled a Written Question asking the Government how many children were detained in February this year in asylum removal centres. I was told that internal management information showed that, as at 20 February 2006, 37 children were detained with their families under Immigration Act powers, all of them at Yarl&#039;s Wood immigration removal centre. We would expect that. The children were all detained as part of families whose detention the Government considered to be necessary as a group. I was certainly interested to read the report by the Children&#039;s Commissioner of an announced visit to Yarl&#039;s Wood immigration removal centre last October, which was the basis of the evidence given to the Select Committee to which the noble Earl has already referred.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>It is important at this stage to note that disturbing conditions were highlighted in that report of children having to go through locked door after locked door. One needs only to read the report to see what picture is built up of the impact of detention on children. As    ever, we say&#151;at least, I say&#151;that there are circumstances in which I must support detention. I know that I may part company with the noble Earl on that; however, I feel that, although the parents have chosen a particular road that leads to their detention, it is not the children&#039;s fault. Despite that, governments have to take hard decisions and one of them may be to detain children who are part of a family group.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I was very interested to note in the conclusions that Yarl&#039;s Wood was trying to take significant steps to improve the conditions for children in its care. As a result of that, it is important for the House to ask the Government today not only to respond to the points of the noble Earl and say whether the Home Office has been able to take forward recommendations about how children&#039;s conditions may be improved but also, outside the remit of the Bill, to take the matter forward by pressing the Government in a series of debates. I return to where I started by saying that I cannot support the noble Earl, because I cannot see how the Bill will resolve this especially difficult issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="60314-32_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, first, I want to deal with the issue of apologies. I shall say <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1206"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this only once to the noble Earl: he really, really, really should not apologise for bringing up these issues. I think that I speak for everyone in your Lordships&#039; House when I say that we have nothing but admiration for how he constantly reminds us of our responsibilities for children. So please do not apologise any more. There is absolutely no need to do so. I apologise to the noble Earl for having left my place to go to the Box, but I am about to go off-message from my notes and it is always wise to warn my officials that that I am about to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>I agreed with the noble Earl that I would say something about monitors. As I was dealing with the earlier amendment, I was wracking my brains to remember the one thing that I had forgotten. We were talking about the children&#039;s champion and I said that I would ask the children&#039;s champion within IND to consider the monitoring arrangements. I hope that that will address that point. Of course, the noble Earl can come back to me if that is not right. Perhaps I may also say how much we welcomed the children&#039;s commission report on Yarl&#039;s Wood and readily agreed that it should return to see the changes and initiatives that have been prompted by it. I know that noble Lords will want to keep in touch with it.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>As I said, I will go off-message on to my own notes. I have indicated at previous stages why I cannot accept the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and I are in the same place on the issue: there are tensions in the system raised by the amendment. We could not accept an amendment under the legal opinion that I have&#151;I will return to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;because we believe that it could create circumstances where it could be used as a means of delaying or preventing people from being returned home, which we could not do.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>I turn to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I saw the legal opinion for the first time this morning. It was received late last night but I was doing other work and I did not get to see it until this morning, so I have not had time to study it as the noble Lord requested. However, it has influenced me to the extent that I recognise that those involved in the Home Office need to study it because, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, it is an important legal opinion and we will deal with it appropriately.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>I agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was saying about the potential to think about the issues in a broader way. I and my noble friend Lady Scotland of Asthal sit on a committee that meets under the auspices of the Minister for Children, whom I cannot say has considered the issue in detail, but it might be an appropriate forum. I will steal that suggestion with grateful thanks and see if there is a way in which we might be able to take it further forward rather than setting up something separate to do so. I want to commit us to take the issue further forward because I cannot accept the amendment, and if the legal opinion stands I will not accept it; I make no commitment to it, but we are back to the underlying issues within the amendments of trying to make sure that children are properly looked after and catered for&#151;if I may describe it like that.

</p>

<a name="60314-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>I want to commit to take the issue back to IND and ask it to carry out the kind of review that noble Lords are looking for across all the children&#039;s issues, part of which I committed to on earlier amendments, with a view to coming back to address the issues properly. The children&#039;s champion is in place&#151;I do not know him but I know that the noble Earl was pleased to see that he is in that position. The noble Earl and I discussed earlier what process I need to follow. I want to add my personal commitment, because I have taken the Bill through, but I am committing everyone else too.
</p>

<a name="60314-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>I do not quite have an answer and perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, can help me afterwards because we need a mechanism for the issue to come back. It may be through the traditional mechanisms of an Unstarred Question, a Starred Question or a Written Question, but I will commit that we will find a way of doing it: we will seek to continue the debate and to address the issues properly. On that basis alone I commit to take forward the issue, to review the legal opinion, to make sure that we are right to reject it for the grounds I have given but to seek to deal with the underlying issue, which the noble Earl and other noble Lords feel strongly needs to be dealt with. I hope that on that basis he will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60314-33_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  My Lords, I thank the Minister for her undertaking that Jeremy Oppenheim, the children&#039;s champion at the immigration and nationality directorate, will meet the Children&#039;s Commissioner to discuss the issue; that she will carefully review the legal implications of the amendment; and that she will ensure that a report will come to me on the problem.

<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="60314-33_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>Page 39, line 23, leave out &quot;as a necessary incident of&quot; and insert &quot;in&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 1, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 in my name, and will make a passing reference to Amendment No. 5 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>I am pleased to introduce these amendments, which give broadcasters and publishers greater certainty that editorial and journalistic practices will not be adversely affected by the London Olympics association right. This issue has been debated at some length both in Committee and on Report. There has been a clear uniformity of purpose on both sides of the House in those debates about what the Bill should do. I think that, without question, we all agree that the press should be free to report or comment on any aspect of the games without fear of infringing the London Olympics association right.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Noble Lords have expressed concerns that the current draft of the Bill, specifically the term &quot;necessary incident&quot;, would inhibit editorial freedom and would give LOCOG a wholly unacceptable role in judging what is classified as editorial content in relation to 2012. That was clearly never the Government&#039;s intention. What we sought to do in Schedule 4(8) was to provide an absolute fail-safe to ensure that journalistic and editorial activity would not fall foul of the London Olympics association right. But in creating that exemption for journalistic and editorial activity, we wanted to ensure that we did not create a loophole that an unscrupulous advertiser could exploit. That was the rationale behind the inclusion of the term &quot;necessary incident&quot; in Schedule 4(8); it was nothing more sinister than that.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I have listened carefully to noble Lords on the Front Benches of both the Opposition parties and to the representations from broadcasters and newspaper publishers on this issue. Although our clear legal advice was that the current drafting of Schedule 4(8) would not have the effect that caused noble Lords such concern, I understand the confusion and unease that the term &quot;necessary incident&quot; created in the publishing and broadcasting industries. That is why I have taken the opportunity to table these amendments today to provide greater clarity about the effect of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1209"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exemptions in paragraph 8. My amendments would exempt publishing or broadcasting reports or information about the 2012 games from infringing the London Olympics association right. It is important that these exemptions will not apply to advertising materials that are published at the same time as, or in connection with, a report or information. In effect, that ensures that no form of advertising will enjoy the same exemptions as we have created for editorial and journalistic use.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>At this point, I should also put on record the fact that my amendments do nothing to change the effect of Schedule 4(8)(d). This paragraph ensures that publishers and broadcasters are allowed to advertise and use promotional time to publicise the report or information that they are providing. For example, a broadcaster would be able to promote or advertise the fact that it is running a current affairs programme about the Olympics or that its sports bulletin will include the latest information on the 2012 games.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Although the debate on these amendments was triggered by consideration of the London Olympic association right, the principle applies also to the Olympic and Paralympic association rights created in existing Olympic symbols protection legislation. That is why I have tabled a similar amendment to Schedule 3, which amends the Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>In tabling these amendments, the Government have recognised the genuine concerns that the London Olympic association right could have adversely affected the freedom of the press&#151;an intention, which none of us had. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who has argued so persuasively on this issue, has tabled Amendment No. 5, which has an effect similar to the amendments which I have put forward. I hope that now that he has had the chance to consider the new amendments, and the assurances that I have given the House about their effect, he will be satisfied that the Government have addressed his concerns. I therefore ask him to withdraw his amendment, and that all noble Lords accept the amendments that I have tabled today. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="60314-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much for putting forward the amendments in the way that he has. I hope that he will not be too disappointed if I do not speak to Amendment No. 5, which was tabled purely as a precaution. We are delighted with the amendments, as I am sure are all noble Lords who spoke so strongly in favour of the previous amendments, which were designed to clarify the point that the Minister has made. I know that the newspaper and broadcasting industry are very pleased, not to say relieved, that that clarification has been given. I cannot resist thanking the Minister for going the extra mile beyond the legal advice that he received. Clearly, there was some conflict in that respect.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>More generally, I thank the Minister for responding extremely helpfully to the concerns raised throughout the Bill. We made it clear from the outset&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said the same thing&#151;that we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1210"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column 1210</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were pressing only the key concerns on the Bill. There was nothing frivolous about the points that we made. Of course, we were supported by very strong representations from the Back Benches on both sides of the House. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is in his place. He was an extremely effective advocate. I cannot resist also awarding medals to all those involved in the debate in Committee, on Report and at Third Reading, particularly to the Minister, to whom I am extremely grateful.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>Further amendments on Report were very welcome to the advertising industry. It is very pleased that its rights to consultation will be enshrined in the Bill. Above all, the great prize during the passage of the Bill was the change from the automatic presumption of liability under the London association right to a much more balanced approach, which gave great relief to those who will have to judge, or try to judge, on behalf of their customers and clients whether they will be infringing. I am very pleased that we have got to the tape in such good shape. We are very supportive of the Bill in its current form.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="60314-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I would like to reiterate a lot of what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has said.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>It has been an interesting Bill. We had some aggressive and strong lobbying from various parts of the advertising and media industries and one or two other people from different directions&#151;including LOCOG&#151;so it was not all one-sided. The Minister and his Bill team have been in serious listening mode throughout Committee and Report stages and in a number of meetings that we have had with the Minister in his office&#151;sometimes with and sometimes without his team.
</p>

<a name="60314-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>We have worked to one end. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, there have been some notable and strong speakers from all around the House&#151;all with one objective: to do as much as we can to make sure that we get this Bill right in order to create the best possible environment from this House to allow local bodies and the Olympic Delivery Authority to go ahead and make the event that we desperately want to be a huge success. I want to finish by thanking the Minister, his Bill team and all of those who have been concerned in the whole way this Bill has been tackled. If democracy in this country could run on the sorts of lines that we have debated this particular Bill, this country would be a better place than it is.

</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60314-34_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes </b>   moved Amendment No. 317BZZA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 233, line 19, leave out subsection (1).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment, which would delete Clause 492(1). Clause 492(1) provides for the senior statutory auditor to be identified by the audit firm in accordance with standards issued by the European Commission or, if there are no such standards, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary of State or a body appointed by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60314-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>How does the Minister see this working when the Bill receives Royal Assent? Will the Commission have issued standards under Article 28 of the directive on statutory audit by then? If it will have not done so, will he explain the process through which it intends to go? Will the Minister say something also about the consultation that the Commission will undertake before issuing standards?
</p>

<a name="60314-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which suggested the amendment, is concerned that interim guidance may have to be issued by the Secretary of State or, presumably, one of the bodies within the FRC. That would be a problem only if the UK&#039;s approach was not then aligned with the ultimate European solution.

</p>

<a name="60314-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The institute points out that International Auditing Standards already contain a definition of an &quot;engagement partner&quot;. This appears in IAS 220, which deals with quality control for auditors of historical information. Would this definition be adopted for UK purposes? Perhaps more importantly, do the Government intend to back this definition for European purposes and help the Commission resist a uniquely European solution when an acceptable international definition already exists? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60314-34_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 492(1) states that audit firms should identify who is to sign an audit report as senior statutory auditor in accordance with standards issued by the European Commission or with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC396"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC396</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

guidance issued in the UK by the Secretary of State or somebody to whom he has delegated the task by order. If the Commission issues standards that address this point, firms will need to comply with them. If the Commission does not address this point, we believe that it should be possible to issue UK guidance, which could be issued by the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of State could delegate the task to somebody such as the FRC or one of its boards.
</p>

<a name="60314-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>There will not be different UK and European descriptions of the senior statutory auditor, because UK guidance can apply only if there are no applicable Commission standards. In practice, we would issue UK guidance only if there was a need and it was seen that there would be a sustained period without European guidance. Even then, we would seek to ensure that the UK&#039;s guidance was consistent with any developing proposals in Europe.
</p>

<a name="60314-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>More specifically on the questions that the noble Baroness raised, we believe that the Commission will issue standards in due course, but possibly not by the time this Bill comes into force. Therefore, we shall see a process involving the FRC and consultation to arrive at an appropriate definition. The point about having one that would be a good starting point for European standards, which we would seek to encourage Europe to pick up, is a good one and one that we would seek to take forward. On the matter of the IAS definition, it is a suggestion that we shall certainly look into as we have no interest in reinventing wheels if there is a suitable definition already available&#151;particularly one that might be a good starting point for Europe. So it will probably not be issued by the Commission in time for implementation, but there will be consultation and the FRC will almost certainly be involved. We would want to have something that would become the European definition, if that was possible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60314-34_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I thought for one moment that there was a sort of knee-jerk reaction whenever the European Commission was mentioned, so I am very glad to hear that the noble Baroness does not have quite the same views as the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart or Lord Tebbit. As has been pointed out, it is inevitable that the Government should take notice of what the European Commission says, but in the mean time it is right that they should negotiate about the particular points. I agree with the noble Baroness.

<a name="60314-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton </b>   moved Amendment No. 317BZA:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>Page 233, line 26, leave out from first &quot;be&quot; to end of line 27 and insert &quot;eligible for appointment as auditor of the company in question (see Chapter 2 of Part 33 of this Act)&quot;</p>

<a name="60314-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment brings the wording of Clause 492 into line with Part 33 of the Bill, which refers to eligibility not qualification for appointment as an auditor. I beg to move.

<a name="60314-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes </b>   moved Amendment No. 317BA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 233, line 29, after &quot;report&quot; insert &quot;or being named in such report pursuant to section 493&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment. The Bill introduces for the first time the signature of an audit report by an individual rather than a firm. Clause 492(3) is helpful in making it clear that there is no additional civil liability attaching to signing an audit report in the auditor&#039;s own name, but the Bill is silent with regard to Clause 493, which requires the naming of a senior statutory auditor. Amendment No. 317BA was suggested to us by some corporate lawyers in the City as a way in which to provide absolute certainty that there are no circumstances, in signing or naming, that will lead to a civil liability on the individual. I hope that the Minister will see that as a helpful amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 317BB, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Razzall. This is in a similar vein to the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment; it is designed to clarify the civil liability position of the senior statutory auditor. It is clear from Clause 492(3) that the auditor&#039;s position is not altered by reason of his signing the audit report. But what is the liability of an individual by virtue of being designated the senior statutory auditor? For example, does he owe a special duty of care to the audit client? The legislation needs to be very clear in that regard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   For an accountant involved in an audit, being identified by his firm as senior statutory auditor will not of itself be an onerous role. The only responsibility that comes with the title is to sign the auditor&#039;s report. Clause 492(2) provides that signing the report does not affect his individual liability. The amendments would broaden this to say that no other aspect of being senior statutory auditor will affect his liability and Amendment No. 317BA refers to &quot;being named&quot; in the auditor&#039;s report.
</p>

<a name="60314-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>There is no way in which being named in a report can in itself make someone subject to a civil liability that he would otherwise not have been subject to. Nor is there anything else about the senior statutory auditor&#039;s role that will affect his liability. The existing wording of Clause 492(3) therefore seems to us to say <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC398"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC398</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all that it is necessary to say about the potential liability of the senior statutory auditor. I am grateful for the opportunity to put that clearly on the record.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response. I understand what he is saying but it is curious that Clause 492(3) refers specifically to the civil liability position in relation to signing the auditor&#039;s report and yet the Bill is silent in respect of anything else. This could lead to the conclusion that being named&#151;or something else&#151;could lead to liability. It is because of the specificity about signing that people have raised the concern that there may be some other way of being dragged into civil liability. That is why the two amendments in this group&#151;both mine and the one in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman&#151;seek to broaden Clause 492(3) to reflect that concern. The way in which the subsection refers only to signing is unsatisfactory.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I can only reiterate what I have said: we believe that there is no other liability which comes with it or could come with it. I hope that that is sufficient. As ever, we will reflect on this discussion, but we do not see that it is necessary to add to the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   When the Minister reflects on this, will he take into account that, as the noble Baroness said, the Bill deals only with the liability issue arising as a result of signing the report. In the process of being a supervisor of the audit, a named senior statutory auditor will do many other things in addition to signing the report. We are seeking to clarify that that does not attract any special duty of care. We are not in any way seeking to put into the Bill anything which detracts from the normal duty of care required. We are concerned whether there is a special duty of care as a result of being named, and signing a report is only one aspect of that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am happy to try to clarify that point. We do not see the position as bringing with it any special duty of care. That is why we do not think it is necessary to say anything beyond that which we have said about liability. I hope that helps matters.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   The Minister has set out the view of the DTI and its advisers on this matter, but if you put yourself in the position of an audit firm, would you, as an audit partner, want to take on the uncertainty relating to this without clear words? That is the point. A number of audit firms have already reported to us that the effect of the Bill is leading some within their firms to consider giving up responsible individual status. We shall come on in a moment to the specific offence, but this is another part of the whole picture. It may be very nice to have an auditor sign the report, but if there is any suggestion that additional personal liability might attach to that, people will walk away in droves.

</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Does the noble Baroness really contend that a duty of care arises only where it is specifically mentioned? I do not think so. A duty of care is determined by the common law.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I am entirely happy to accept that position, but this Bill changes the nature of the role of individuals within an audit firm. To date, the audit firm has been the auditor, and it has been very clear that any cause of action lay against the firm. By putting the senior statutory auditor out in the open, there is a possibility that a duty of care may go along with that. That is the nature of the uncertainty. The Minister says the Government do not think it is like that, but I have to tell him that is not good enough if you are sitting in an audit firm potentially building up personal liabilities on top of the bit you share as part of an audit firm.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   I am afraid I am not satisfied with this. Essentially we are talking about an enhanced duty of care. That is the concern. The Government say they are anxious to clarify that there is no enhanced duty of    care as a result of signing the report. That demonstrates a lack of understanding about the process of an audit, how it happens and what people do. A senior statutory auditor may well turn up to an audit committee. He may make an oral statement. Does he have an enhanced duty of care that you are seeking to clarify by virtue of signing the report because of an oral statement at an audit committee? That is the issue. If it is necessary to clarify it in terms of signing the audit report, why not clarify it on the broader ground?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   Before the Minister rises, I would like to turn to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. No doubt in his references to &quot;common law&quot; he was contemplating the effects of Merritt v Babb and Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Limited. The Minister ought to indicate in his answer whether he believes that those two common law cases affect the issue being discussed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am grateful for that last specific question. I will look at the record and revert on those two cases quoted, but I am sure the noble Lord will understand that I do not have a detailed response to that at my fingertips.
</p>

<a name="60314-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>To be clear: we do not see that any enhanced duty of care comes from the role, but we will study the record of this debate, and, if there are specific concerns that can be identified by the profession that we are not taking seriously, we will be happy to look at them. The Bill does not change the role of a senior statutory auditor, except to require him or her to be identified. The role of the engagement partner or the senior partner on the audit does not change thereby. The Bill does not bring in any special duties because of that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60314-35_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Is there any example known to the law of an enhanced duty of care? I am not sure, but <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60314-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   If the noble Lord is making the point that there is either a duty of care or there is not, and there is no such thing as an enhanced duty of care, I can see that might well be the case. I am not a lawyer. We will revert on that if we need to in the context of this debate. I have tried to set out as clearly as possible what we believe the position to be. We have put on the record that there are no extra duties coming from the extra liability that can accrue to the senior statutory auditor, but we will take this discussion away, and if we find we want to revert in a different manner we will. I am not convinced thus far, however, that we should.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60314-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for moving to that degree. We too will go and discuss again with those who are most closely affected by this. This is one of a number of areas where the audit profession will react to the Bill in a way that may strike the Minister as strange. Nevertheless, I hope that the Government can see the point of view of the audit firms and the individuals in them. The changes need to be thought through carefully, and it will not be satisfactory for auditors to rely only on a view expressed by the Minister at this Dispatch Box, however genuinely held that view is, because of the uncertainty about the ultimate legal position, which will be corrosive and potentially damaging.

&quot;(3A)   The auditor&#039;s name or the name of the senior statutory auditor need not be stated if the auditor or senior statutory auditor&#151;

<br>
(a)   has given notice to the Secretary of State that the auditor or the senior statutory auditor considers on reasonable grounds that the statement of the name in published copies of the report would create or be likely to create a serious risk that the auditor, the senior statutory auditor or any other person would be subject to violence or intimidation, and


<br>
(b)   has notified the company that they have given notice to the Secretary of State.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment I shall speak also to the two other amendments in this group.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Clause 493 requires auditors&#039; and senior statutory auditors&#039; names to be stated when the auditors&#039; reports are published, but has an important ability to withhold the name if there is a serious risk of violence or intimidation. We fully support that. But the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC401"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC401</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

withholding of the name is wholly in the hands of the company which, under subsection (3), must pass a resolution and give notice to the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which suggested these amendments to us, believes that the auditor or the senior statutory auditor should also be able to initiate the withholding of names. In the case of the withholding of directors&#039; home addresses under Clause 217, the power is given to the individual director to avoid publication. It is not left in the hands of the company, and we argue by analogy that there should be an equivalent power for the audit firm or the senior statutory auditor in relation to the disclosure of names.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I accept that auditors are not powerless. They could refuse to sign the audit report or they could resign from the audit. But those are nuclear options, and it should not be necessary for auditors to resort to those options. It would be more civilised to give the auditors the ability to remove their names. I hope the Minister will agree, and I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60314-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: As has been identified, C </b>  lause 493 puts a duty on a company to include the name of the auditor and, if there is one, the senior statutory auditor in the copy of the audit report that it circulates to its shareholders or otherwise publishes. It also provides an important exception from this duty to deal with the case where there is a risk of violence or intimidation if the names are revealed in that way.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>As noble Lords will be well aware, threats of violence have been used against suppliers to a number of companies, particularly bioscience companies, and at least one such company has been unable to appoint an auditor as a result of those threats. The auditor is in a more difficult position than other suppliers because there is a statutory duty to publish his name. Publication of the name of the auditor is important as a general rule so that the markets and the public have the information necessary to assess the confidence they can put in the audit&#039;s assurance of the truth and the fairness of the accounts. But I am sure that noble Lords will agree that it should also be possible to withhold the names in the special circumstances I have described.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Because it is for the company to publish the audit report, and to include in it the auditors&#039; names, it is appropriate that they have the option of using the exception. In practice, I am sure that in circumstances where there is a risk of violence, the company and the auditors will have discussed disclosure of the name at the time the auditors were appointed. Use of the exception&#151;assuming the conditions for it still exist&#151;may be a condition of the audit contract.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I can understand the motivation behind the amendment. Who better than the auditors to assess whether they are at risk of violence or intimidation? But I believe that adding this option for auditors to use would be unnecessary and ineffective, because where there is a real external threat, the company and auditors will be able to work together only if they have a shared understanding of what that threat is and how <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC402"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC402</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they should deal with it. The question of disclosure of the auditors&#039; names may well be covered in the auditors&#039; terms of appointment.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The amendment would have purpose only if there was a difference in perception between the company and the auditor. If the company believes there is no risk, then it must include the names in published versions of the audit report. If it does not, then it is committing the offence in subsection (6). In the absence of a real risk, it would be no defence that the auditors had sent a notice to the Secretary of State under this amendment. That is why I believe that the amendment would be ineffective. If the company does not believe there is a risk, the new right would be of no practical value, because it does not override the company&#039;s obligations. If the company does believe there is a risk, it will use the exemption in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The criminals who use violence against bioscience companies in this way create very real situations for many honest people. I am afraid that if there were a case where the auditor thinks there is a risk and the company disagrees, the auditor&#039;s only way out may be to resign, as has been identified, which is always his right.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The amendment to Clause 494 as it stands serves a useful purpose. Where company and auditor agree there is a risk, they can keep the auditors&#039; names out of the published accounts. If the company does not include the name of the auditor and the senior statutory auditor in its published audit report when the exception does not apply, then the company and all its directors and other officers responsible for the default commit an offence.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>There may be cases where unscrupulous directors for some reason do not want to reveal the names of their auditors but, if so, I do not believe they would choose this route. They would have to put to the company&#039;s shareholders a resolution to the effect that there is a risk of violence and send a copy of the resolution to the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60314-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness understands the thrust of this response. An amendment that gives auditors this right does not override the company&#039;s obligation to make a judgment on this matter. If it happens to make a different judgment and believes there is no risk, it has a clear responsibility under the Bill to name the auditor.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60314-36_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. He said that it was ineffective, but I think that that is a matter of drafting. The amendments may be incorrectly drafted in that they do not affect the companies&#039; obligations. It is perfectly plausible to draft them differently so that if the auditors believed that their name should not be included, the company would have to accept that judgment. That is a drafting point rather than a point of substance. The point of substance is whether it is necessary and whether you can rely on using the options of resignation or refusal to sign an audit report.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>The noble Baroness said: The general rule in Clause 493(1) about naming the auditor and senior statutory auditor need not be followed if the company resolves that the names should not be given under subsection (3). Paragraph (b) of subsection (3) requires &quot;notice of the resolution&quot; to be given to the Secretary of State. When the Bill uses &quot;notice&quot; in relation to resolutions elsewhere&#151;in Part 13, for example, which deals with resolutions and meetings&#151;the word means something like advance notification. But it seems to have a different meaning in Clause 493, rather more like <i>ex post</i> notification, as it is clear that the Secretary of State is told after a resolution is passed.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>When we get to subsection (4), which refers to the content of the &quot;notice of the resolution&quot;, it is not clear whether it refers to the <i>ex ante</i> notification of the fact that a resolution is to be proposed under subsection (3)(a) or the <i>ex post</i> notification to the Secretary of State that it has been passed, as required by paragraph (b). Amendment No. 317C seeks to make it clear that it is the latter in paragraph (b) and not the former. Since the &quot;notice of the resolution&quot; in subsection (4) has to contain the name of the audit firm and the senior statutory auditor, it is rather important that we are not talking about a notice that would be on the public record.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Will the Minister also confirm that the reference to   a resolution in paragraph (a) is to a resolution passed by the board of directors? On the previous amendment, the Minister seemed to refer to a resolution by the company. Clearly if it is a resolution by the company, there will be an issue of the notice of the resolution being specific and on the public record, which causes a particular problem. I am therefore seeking clarification of how notice is used in this clause and of what kind of resolution needs to be passed by the company, which has an important knock-on effect. I beg to move.

There is only one &quot;notice of resolution&quot; mentioned in the clause; indeed there is only one resolution involved and it is specifically mentioned in the preceding line. I do not think that we need these extra words. Clause 493 provides that the name of the auditor&#151;and, if the auditor is a firm, the name of the senior statutory auditor&#151;must be included in the copies of the auditor&#039;s report that it sends out. There is an exception where there is a risk of violence or intimidation, as we have just discussed.

I asked the Minister whether the resolution in subsection (3)(a) is a resolution of the board or of the company. If it is a resolution of the company, we are getting into the issue of there being publication of a notice of a resolution which will contain the names. It therefore does not seem helpful. In any event, the provision is ambiguous about whether it is the board or the company and that may well need to be clarified. But if it is the company, then it raises issues of notice of the resolution being open to the members before the resolution is passed as it is itself a public document.

<a name="60314-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I am grateful; I think I now understand the point being made. As I understand it, the resolution will be a resolution of the shareholders. The reference to the notice of the resolution in subsection (4) is meant to deal with the detail provided in the notice to the Secretary of State. I think the point that the noble Baroness is probing is the nature of the notice which must be given for the resolution on the company&#039;s decision which will impact on that and whether that would have to spell out these details. If it did, it clearly would not be a very effective process, but I do not believe that it does. Perhaps I should write to the noble Baroness on that so that she has some clarity on the record. But I understand the point that has been put.

<a name="60314-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The phase &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; could lead to criminal charges being brought when there has been an honest mistake or when behaviour was, at its worst, negligent. In fact, the effect of the Bill is to single out audit as the only profession in which gross negligence is criminalised. The word &quot;knowingly&quot; gives rise to difficulties of interpretation, as arose in the context of deliberate behaviour under the Limitation Act 1986, which ultimately had to be resolved by the House of Lords. Both the DTI and the Solicitor-General&#039;s office have had various counsels&#039; opinions on these words relating to the Bill. As for the word &quot;recklessly&quot;, the Law Society stated in its June 2005 response to the White Paper that the case law on recklessness shows that the meaning varies depending on the context. We do not think that it would be appropriate for there to be any uncertainty in that area as to what is required.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The amendment addresses these issues by clarifying that the auditor&#039;s offence is confined to the aspect of the auditor&#039;s duty to form an opinion of the company&#039;s accounting records that relates to the basis of annual accounts which are properly prepared in accordance with the Bill and give a true and fair view.

</p>

<a name="60314-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>As the Minister will be aware, the introduction of this specific criminal offence has created widespread dismay among the auditing profession. It is not supported by the CBI, which describes the policy as lacking evidence. The Government backed away at the last minute from creating an offence that carried the penalty of imprisonment, but that has not allayed the concerns that existed and still exist about the offence.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I started off with the view that if directors can be subject to a number of offences throughout the Bill that are based on recklessness, why cannot the auditors, but I have been convinced that it would be wrong to create this offence. As I said, the CBI claims that there is no evidence for requiring this solution and I do not believe that there is evidence of a problem of reckless auditors that cannot be dealt with by the existing law. So we are creating a criminal offence and a hypothesis of some future problem.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I refer, too, to the oversight arrangements for the auditing profession, which have only recently been introduced. There is no evidence&#151;or, as far as I am aware, even a suggestion&#151;that those arrangements will not prove effective in dealing with the worst kind of auditing behaviour. The Accountancy Investigation and Discipline Board has powers to deal with bad auditors by issuing unlimited fines and banning individuals or firms from carrying out audits, so achieving precisely the same result as a criminal prosecution under Clause 494. The only difference is whether a criminal record is created.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC406"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC406</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I am advised that the new oversight arrangements might themselves be compromised by the new offence. If the AIDB were going to investigate something that might also be investigated for possible prosecution under Clause 494, the audit firm itself may have to advise its audit partners and staff to take independent advice, because their interests may not be the same as the firm&#039;s. That advice would almost certainly be not to co-operate with the AIDB and, if a criminal prosecution was launched, it would almost certainly have to halt the process under the AIDB. So the recklessness offence may mean that the new disciplinary arrangements become almost worthless.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, referred to the legal advice on recklessness and the lack of certainty that comes with it. We should be clear that the response of the audit profession will be risk-averse auditing. The consequence of that will be more costly audits, as audit firms seek to ensure that their audit procedures and testing levels will be beyond criticism. It may also mean far more qualified accounts, especially as the new offence is not only about true and fair accounts but also about the other detailed matters set out in subsection (2).
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>It is not even clear whether this offence requires intent. On Second Reading, the Minister said that it required,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;a conscious decision by the auditor: at least a decision to turn a blind eye&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11/1/06; col. 245.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>So an auditor who has no intention of deception or fraud but who, through misjudgment or negligence, decides not to pursue an audit matter could well be caught. That seems to fall far short of intent, and that, too, is causing concern.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I mentioned earlier in connection with another amendment that some firms are reporting a potential reluctance by their senior individuals to carry responsible individual status, which could well diminish the pool of available experienced auditors. Other firms have reported to us that the recruitment and retention of talented graduates could be seriously harmed if the offence exists. There are easier and less risky ways to make money. If the profession cannot attract the best graduates, that in turn will have a knock-on effect on the quality of the profession in the long term, and that could affect the reputation of corporate Britain.
</p>

<a name="60314-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I am most concerned that the proposals in Clause 494 carry the risk of serious harm and I fully support the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie.

</p>

<a name="60314-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>In relation to the amendment, I have been tempted to have a look at the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. I declare another interest in that I was one of the people who put that Act through your Lordships&#039; House. If the Minister and his advisers look at column 442 of volume 383 of the <i>Official Report</i>, they will find a very interesting reference to &quot;recklessness&quot; by the late Lord Jacques, who was steering that legislation through the House. The definition of &quot;reckless&quot; in that Act certainly seems to bear out everything that my noble friend Lady Noakes has said. It definitely left an air of uncertainty. In case the Minister thinks that 1977 is going back a bit too far, it is referred to extensively in the Bill. I should be interested to learn of any cases in law that refer to recklessness and the duty of care of an auditor.

The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, pointed out that, in providing separate figures for tax, there can be a confusion between two non-accountants&#151;perhaps non-auditors and lawyers, too&#151;about the effective declaration made by the auditor. I ask the Minister to look very carefully at what &quot;reckless&quot; is&#151;it is in the Bill under his name. The amendment proposed by my noble friend Lady Noakes and the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, meets my concerns as someone viewing this matter as an auditor from the outside.

<a name="60314-38_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  The reliability of company accounts is obviously of vital importance to shareholders, capital markets and the economy as a whole. The auditor&#039;s role is vital in providing assurances of reliability. The new offences for auditors set out in Clause 494 will apply to an auditor who knowingly or recklessly causes an audit report to include misleading, false or deceptive matter, or who knowingly or recklessly omits a statement of one of the shortcomings listed in subsection (2).
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Later in this part we will reach the provisions that would enable auditors to agree limitations of their liability. Some investors may feel uneasy about this. They may feel that the current risk of unlimited financial liability is one of the incentives that make auditors keen to do a thorough job, and that limiting their liability may reduce this incentive. These new offences could be seen as helping to rebalance the incentives. Of course the overwhelming majority of auditors are diligent and trustworthy, but this provision should increase the incentive for each auditor to check for any potential problems in a company&#039;s accounts and, if there are problems, to reflect them truthfully in the audit report.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC408"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC408</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Amendments Nos. 318, 318A, 319 and 320 would narrow the scope of the offences in two ways. Three of them are aimed at making the test whether the auditor had acted &quot;dishonestly or fraudulently&quot; rather than &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot;, and one would remove the word &quot;misleading&quot; from the phrase &quot;misleading, false or deceptive&quot;. I am happy to explain why the Government believe that the carefully chosen words in the Bill are appropriate. The purpose of the new offence is not to deal with an auditor who can be proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. There are already many other offences that can be used in such cases, including those included in the Fraud Bill currently before your Lordships&#039; House. If one puts &quot;dishonestly and fraudulently&quot; in the clause, I am sure, as the noble Baroness realises, it would make the clause completely redundant for that purpose.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The kind of situation the offences will deal with is when an auditor knows that there is a problem with a company&#039;s accounts and is unwilling to qualify the accounts, perhaps in deference to the director of the company; perhaps even to his partners, who may not wish to lose the client. If such an auditor decides to issue a clean audit report, we believe it is right he should be subject to prosecution or a fine.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>A further example would be an auditor who suspects that if he looked more closely at a particular area of a company&#039;s books he would discover a problem, and therefore decides not to go further into that area. That is recklessness. It will be necessary to establish that the auditor has decided to blind eye for the offence to be proven. If he had merely overlooked the signs of problems through incompetence or laziness, that could be negligence, but he would not be guilty of this new offence.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>A further, more extreme example would be the auditor who simply plays a round of golf with the company&#039;s finance director and agrees to sign a clean audit report. That is clearly reckless, and I am sure noble Lords would all agree it should be punishable, but it may well not be enough to be dishonest or fraudulent.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Using the test of &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; in these offences for auditors is in line with the corresponding offence for directors in Clause 387, which applies to any director who knew the accounts did not comply with the Act, or who was reckless as to whether they complied. That offence is essentially restating the existing offence in Section 233 of the Companies Act 1985.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Auditors reporting on quoted companies or any company whose shares are traded are potentially already subject to an offence if they knowingly or recklessly make a statement that is misleading, false or deceptive. Section 397 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 even expands on &quot;recklessly&quot; in this context by adding in brackets, &quot;dishonestly or otherwise&quot;&#151;and I emphasise the &quot;or otherwise&quot;. I hope I have explained why we want to use the test of &quot;knowingly and recklessly&quot;, why &quot;dishonestly and fraudulently&quot; would not achieve our policy, and why we do not believe the word &quot;recklessly&quot; should cause undue fear among auditors.

</p>

<a name="60314-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I turn now to whether it is necessary to include misleading matter within the scope of the offence as well as false or deceptive matter. It has been suggested that &quot;misleading&quot; is too vague a term, which will make auditors anxious that missing any possible ambiguity or scope for misunderstanding might leave them open to prosecution. I think I can explain simply why this concern is misplaced.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>If I may begin by stating the obvious, the question of whether something is misleading applies to the auditor&#039;s report, not to the accounts themselves. It should not be difficult for the diligent auditor to draft a straightforward report&#151;I believe there are templates available&#151;that says clearly whether the accounts are true and fair or whether there is an issue with them, and, if so, explaining what it is. On the other hand, consider an auditor who finds that he has to qualify his report on the company&#039;s accounts because of a real problem with the company. He may not want to be frank about the problems he has found and he may try to write a report which, while not false, gives the impression that the qualification is merely technical. The purpose of these offences is to encourage frank reporting and so it is right that misleading matter is within their scope.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I hope that I have explained clearly why we believe that the two phrases, &quot;knowingly and recklessly&quot; and &quot;misleading, false or deceptive&quot; are the right ones to use here. If properly understood, these new offences should be of no concern to the overwhelming majority of auditors who would not consider behaving improperly. Of course, it is possible that some auditors may misunderstand the risk of prosecution and if this was left uncorrected it would have adverse consequences. I am grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord who have tabled these amendments for giving me this opportunity to clarify the meaning and intention of Clause 494&#151;and particularly the words &quot;recklessly&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;&#151;and I hope that the explanation I have given today will help to avoid misunderstandings.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Let me deal with two other questions. The noble Baroness expressed concern that the same audit report could give rise to both disciplinary proceedings and to criminal prosecution under Clause 494 and that this could interact in an unfavourable way and make the system more difficult to operate. Ensuring that the two systems work well together is the point of Clauses 495 and 496, and when we get to them I shall be happy to debate why I think we have a system that will work perfectly well.
</p>

<a name="60314-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Finally, I should say that we have not had any counsel&#039;s opinion on &quot;recklessness&quot;, as was implied.

<a name="60314-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Before the noble Baroness decides what to do with her amendment, I raised the issue of the additional costs that would be incurred. It has been made quite clear that the inclusion of this offence&#151;I referred to this earlier in the Committee&#151;will result in risk-averse auditing behaviour because it substantially raises the stakes. It is inevitable that it <br>&nbsp;<br>

will have such an effect. It will have a knock-on effect on company costs and, therefore, it will be an additional regulatory burden.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>As the Government have produced no evidence that there is an ill that needs to be solved, I cannot see how a cost-benefit analysis could come out in favour of this. When the Minister sought to justify the clause he did so in hypothetical terms. He referred to rebalancing incentives as if limitation of liability agreements will suddenly magic away the issue of auditor liability and make auditors say, &quot;Yippee, we do not have to worry about good auditing any more because we have limited our liability&quot;. That is not what a limitation of liability agreement does. It still leaves auditors who have done bad auditing with a very significant liability&#151;namely, whatever is agreed&#151;which may well be on a proportionate liability basis. So there is not an issue of rebalancing incentives&#151;auditors still have the right incentives to carry out good audits&#151;and the Minister has not given any evidence that the offence is needed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60314-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Let me deal with the question of additional costs and the implication that this will lead to a great deal of box-ticking and extra work. I do not see that this is important either way. The question is whether or not the auditor is doing the job properly. If he is not doing it properly, no amount of box-ticking will deal with the situation. If doing the job properly leads to additional costs, it seems to me that that is a good cost to incur.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60314-39_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I think the Minister misunderstands. This means that every auditor in the land will do additional work&#151;and therefore incur costs&#151;against the hypothesis that there might be one or two auditors who, for one reason or another, choose not to carry out the right level of testing or are careless as to whether or not they do so. This has to be seen in the context of spreading across the whole of auditing&#151;both in public companies and private companies&#151;because the offence will change the nature of the way in which audits are carried out. We have been clearly advised on that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60314-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Perhaps I may make a couple of points. The disciplinary proceedings are very severe and I cannot see that these provisions would radically change that position. Equally, once they are properly understood, I do not think there will be any need for the vast majority of auditors, who do their work in a diligent and straightforward way, to fear them. We therefore do not see that there should be any major change of behaviour by any auditors, other than those who are tempted to issue inaccurate audit reports or not to investigate problems.

<a name="60314-39_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   We have spent some time debating the specifics of Clause 494, and I shall not repeat all that material. The purpose of this stand part debate is to discuss whether it is appropriate to have an auditor-specific offence in the Bill at all. It is my contention that it is not.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I have already said that I do not believe there is any evidence of a problem that would require this offence. But, to the extent that fraud or dishonesty is involved in auditing, I believe that it can be dealt with by the existing criminal law, including the current Fraud Bill, which is at this moment being debated in the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>If the Government do not believe that the existing and planned criminal offences cover the kind of problems that they believe auditors present, I invite them to set out precisely why that is. Is the general law not sufficiently clear to deal with the problems that the Government believe exist? We need to narrow down specifically what auditors do that require an auditor-specific offence.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>We should, as legislators, be very wary of creating legislation for criminal offences for particular professions. I believe that this legislation is unprecedented. For example, despite the considerable dangers that doctors and nurses can present to the public&#151;far more dangerous, I suggest, than the odd negligent auditor&#151;there are no specific offences for the medical profession. Society relies on the general criminal law and the medical profession&#039;s own disciplinary arrangements.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I invite the Government to give an example of a profession that has been singled out for treatment under the criminal law in the way that auditors have been singled out. Alternatively, can the Government give policy reasons why doctors and nurses are treated in one way but auditors are to be treated in another? We can argue about the wording, as we did in the previous group of amendments, but the real problem is that there is no clearly made case for the Bill to create the offence at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60314-39_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   As I explained on the previous group of amendments, because of the importance to all of us of reliable company accounts, we believe that there should be an offence for auditors who knowingly or recklessly produce inaccurate audit reports.

</p>

<a name="60314-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>There is already a disciplinary system for practising auditors.

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We hope that the threat of criminal prosecution adds some level of threat that will act as an extra incentive for those considering behaving improperly. But we accept that there are already punishments available that will be adequate in most cases. We believe that for the most serious cases, because there is a wider social interest in the integrity of accountants, it is appropriate that the option of criminal prosecution should be available. As I have said, we do not think that the existing law is adequate because an auditor who turns a blind eye will be unlikely to be guilty of any existing offence. He would need to be involved in some sort of fraudulent conspiracy for existing law to apply. So we think that there is something which is outside this.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I do not think that the appropriate comparison is necessarily with other professional bodies. The question is whether we think that auditors should in some sense be different from directors when looking at accounts. It seems to me that, if anything, it is more important that they should also not act knowingly and recklessly in these circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60314-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I am aware that many accountants are concerned about these new offences, and that is entirely understandable; to find that a new risk of criminal prosecution applies to the profession is bound to make one think. But I do not believe that there is anything here to worry the vast majority of auditors. As I explained, it is only the auditor who consciously decided to do something wrong, even if it was to turn a blind eye, who could fall foul of these provisions. The threat of criminal prosecution is a significant but small increase in the sanctions available to deal with auditors who behave improperly. So long as auditors understand that and understand that the new offences will apply only to those who behave improperly, I do not believe there is any reason why these provisions should cause all auditors to carry out more checks and be less willing to exercise judgment.

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>As it is so important that these new offences are properly understood, I am again grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord for tabling the amendment and for giving me this opportunity to clarify further the meaning and intention of Clause 494.

<a name="60314-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that response. He will not be surprised that I do not find it a very satisfactory response. He said that the general law is adequate in most cases. The only example he gave of the general law being inadequate was an auditor turning a blind eye. Presumably the auditor in question was doing so with no intention of dishonesty, because if there were dishonesty there would be a very clear way in which that activity could be caught. So here the Government are intending to criminalise negligence. The Minister said that there is an interest in the integrity of accountants which justifies criminal prosecution. I return to my example. I think that there is a much greater public interest in the integrity of doctors and nurses and, indeed, in many other groups of individuals.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I really do not think that the Government have made their case on this; nor do I believe they have listened to the impact that this will have on companies&#039; costs. The Minister can assert that this should not add anything because they already have the disciplinary arrangements, but I can assure him that the fear of    criminal prosecution will have very wide repercussions. Between now and Report, we will want consult the groups that have a particular concern, but the Minister should be under no illusion that this will not be an area that we shall wish to return to with some force on Report.

</p>

<a name="60314-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I wish to raise questions about the need for the Secretary of State to issue guidance for regulatory and prosecuting authorities. In relation to the regulatory authorities, the Minister will be aware that the regulatory arrangements for the accountancy profession have recently been set up with some care to achieve an appropriately independent regime&#151;one that is certainly independent of the accountancy profession but is not seen merely as an arm of government.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The Government are saying in these clauses that they can tell that independent regime what to do. The Government appear to be saying that the regulatory arrangements cannot be relied upon and need to be underpinned by the Secretary of State&#039;s guidance as to what the regulatory body should or should not do in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC414"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC414</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relation to auditor behaviour. I hope that the Minister will say something about what kind of guidance the Government intend to issue to the regulatory bodies under these clauses. I also hope that he will say what the status of that guidance will be. What happens if the regulatory bodies believe that their functions would be better served by not following the guidance? It is not clear that issuing guidance necessarily has any impact.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I cannot understand why the Secretary of State should have any locus as regards the prosecuting authorities. I have always understood that they consider the law, the evidence and the public interest in determining whether or not to prosecute. I think that I am right in that but, if I am not, I am sure that the Minister will correct me. What kind of guidance could the Secretary of State validly give to the prosecuting authorities? I hope that the Minister will explain a little more of what the Government have in mind.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>We are sceptical about the need for the Secretary of State to give guidance at all, but I hope that the Minister will say something about the process of drawing up guidance, particularly in relation to consultation processes. Subsection (2) refers to the consent of the Attorney-General but says nothing about consultation with those likely to be affected. I assume that the guidance will deal with some highly technical issues of accounting and auditing, but there will inevitably be a fear that those will be developed behind closed doors. The one thing that I can predict is that civil servants issuing guidance on auditing practice would not be robust.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The Minister will be aware that we are not fans of the offence described in Clause 494, but even less are we fans of an offence that has to be overseen in such detail by the DTI. The degree of interference that the Government have drafted into the Bill suggests that the offence is not robustly drawn. I hope that the Minister can see that these proposals go beyond what is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60314-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   As the noble Baroness said, there is already a disciplinary system for practising auditors, and the purpose of Clauses 495 and 496 is to enable guidance to be issued to avoid any conflict between prosecution for an apparent offence under Clause 494 and disciplinary action based on the same facts.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I understand that there is concern that the same audit report could give rise both to disciplinary proceedings and to criminal prosecution under Clause 494. The worry, I believe, is that in disciplinary proceedings auditors will be less willing to be forthcoming&#151;they may be advised by their lawyers to be less forthcoming&#151;for fear that the evidence they give could be used in a criminal prosecution.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I believe that that concern is unjustified. As a number of noble Lords have mentioned, there are already a number of existing offences with which auditors can be charged&#151;for example, if they are fraudulent or dishonest. We know of no evidence that fear of that is causing auditors to withhold information from the Accountancy Investigation and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC415"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC415</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Discipline Board or from the professional conduct arms of the accountancy institutes. Nor do we see why the introduction of these new offences should make a dramatic difference to the behaviour of auditors who appear before them.

</p>

<a name="60314-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Nevertheless, we have provided in Clauses 495 and 496 for guidance to prosecutors and regulations that will help to avoid any conflict. The noble Baroness implied that this was new and unusual, but it is modelled on similar provisions in Section 130 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where market abuse can also give rise to criminal and non-criminal proceedings. Guidance is effective in that area in avoiding conflicts. In particular, it enables the prosecutor to decide not to prosecute in a case which would be better handled through the disciplinary proceedings. We would envisage guidance on the new offence relating to the auditor&#039;s report having the same effect.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Another example is the tax authorities, which make a similar judgment in deciding whether to impose penalty fines on defaulters or to start a criminal prosecution. It is only where the scale and seriousness of the default are great that they will consider prosecution appropriate. We see no reason why the prosecution and regulators should not be able to reach a similarly sensible decision in relation to auditors. Full consultation on this will take place. That will involve the Attorney-General, who acts independently of the Government in relation to the guidance.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked what kind of guidance would be issued. Guidance will assist regulators and prosecutors in deciding whether prosecution or the disciplinary proceedings should be used. She asked about the status of that guidance. Guidance will among other things help prosecutors avoid any unlawfulness in the decision not to prosecute. She asked what would happen if the regulators did not want to follow guidance. Regulators will be aware that if they ignore guidance and cause a conflict with prosecutors, they will compromise the effectiveness of both their own function and that of the prosecution. We would not expect regulators to take such an approach lightly.
</p>

<a name="60314-40_para15"></a>

<a name="60314-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I listened carefully to what the Minister said. Market abuse was extraordinarily controversial in terms of its perceived impact on the City. I am not sure that that is a good example of something that was introduced without a great deal of public consultation. I am not sure that I heard him address the point that my noble friend made about the need for consultation with those who will be involved in this. The Minister talked about the consent of the Attorney-General, but my noble friend was concerned about consultation. Certainly, the issue of market abuse was consulted on very widely. Some provision which would provide some protection and assurance to those involved would be very important.

see no circumstances where that would not take place. There is perhaps a distinction to be made between market abuse, which was very controversial, and the guidance. Was the guidance controversial too? That is a slightly different issue.

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The Minister is justifying this complex way of proceeding for a very small area, which is apparently not covered by the existing law.

</p>

<a name="60314-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I have tabled the amendment for two reasons. The first is to ensure a proper flow of information between members about the removal of the auditor. This is necessary to enable the members to consider the issue properly and the auditor to judge the context in which his representations, if any, should be made. That would ensure that the real reasons were given for removal, which would act as a break on managers if they were seeking to rid themselves of an auditor for the wrong reasons.
</p>

<a name="60314-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The second reason that I have tabled the amendment relates to part 1 of Article 36 of the eighth directive, which states that divergence of opinion on accounting treatments or audit procedures should not be a ground for dismissal. As I understand it, the Bill seeks to implement part 2 of Article 36, but does not seem to do so for part 1. Therefore, my amendment is also a vehicle for asking the Government what are their intentions in relation to part 1 and why they have chosen not to implement part 1 by way of this Bill. I beg to move.

meeting a responsibility which is unnecessary or at least inordinate. It is incumbent on the attendees at the meeting to say whether the case has been made out for the auditors to be expunged. We do not have to go any further than that. In other words, the present law is adequate in all respects.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, that much business of meetings is transacted by proxies, with shareholders being given adequate information in the documentation that convenes the meeting. This does not have any bearing on what a chairman does at a meeting. The issue is whether shareholders are given adequate information to allow them to make their judgments. Many of them will make their judgments by returning a proxy. The amendment would also give auditors a context in which to make their representations. Those are the reasons why I propose it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I accept that they are perfectly adequate reasons, but I in no way distinguish between what is being advanced and the present law. The attendance by proxy of certain shareholders is perfectly proper, but it is open for anybody to raise the issue at the meeting.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   For an external shareholder, who may not attend the meeting, to know why the auditor has resigned, at whose behest it was and the underlying reasons for it, is surely extremely valuable. He should not have to travel to Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle or wherever the company is located to attend the meeting to get that information. Surely it should be available to you as part of the process so that you can judge whether it is the auditor or, indeed, the directors of the company in which you have invested who need to be looked into further and considered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   It is perfectly open for any shareholder, when he or she receives the agenda of the meeting, to say that the abolition of the auditor is not justified. In those circumstances, a proxy would be rather&#151;I cannot think of the word.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   I support the amendment as it seems to be the one thing that is missing here. We should remember that we are dealing with a resolution proposed to the members to remove an auditor from office. The auditor is usually appointed by the members on the recommendation of the board. Earlier, we debated the issue of nominee shareholdings and how they find out about things. With such wide use of proxies, it seems to be fundamental to state why you want to remove the auditor. It is very simple, and I cannot understand why it is not there.

</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   With respect, I think that the noble Lord is taking a perfectly accurate but theoretical view of this matter. Most shareholders receive the annual report over their cornflakes and look through it. If it was just a case of the auditor being removed, they might turn to their toast and marmalade, but if the report said that it was for this or that reason, they might say, &quot;That&#039;s something rather special and I need to get involved in this&quot;. It is a question of transparency and of signalling the significance of what is being proposed from the point of view of the auditor and of the company to the great benefit of the shareholder.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Does the noble Lord not agree that the removal of the auditor is something very special and, for that reason, if objection to it is taken by any shareholder, he or she should attend the meeting? If he or she does not attend and the resolution goes through, that is too bad.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60314-41_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   If I may say so, with respect, again that is a very theoretical approach. A small shareholder in a company who owns a few thousand shares might feel, if he knows the background, that this is an issue in which he wishes to get involved. Without any information, he is not going to get on a train to travel to Newcastle to attend the annual general meeting. That is life. Theoretically he should do so, but it is not going to happen. Given that on both sides of the Committee we are concerned about transparency and about people knowing the facts, this is an easy opportunity to have to put all the facts before the shareholders, who can then decide whether to attend, not attend, give a proxy to someone or just let the whole thing go hang, which is their privilege, as the noble Lord rightly points out.

<a name="60314-41_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 497 enables the members of a company to remove an auditor from office at any time by ordinary motion at a general meeting. This and the subsequent clauses on the notice required and the need to inform the registrar are rewritten, but not substantially changed from the existing provisions in the Companies Act 1985&#151;so we are not talking about anything new. The auditor has the right to make representations and to have them sent to the members, and to attend the general meeting at which the resolution is to be taken.
</p>

<a name="60314-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Amendment No. 320A proposes that the notice of the resolution should contain reasons for the removal of the auditor. It is important that the members of a company should have a right to decide who their auditor is, and they should not have to justify their choice. Of course, the auditor is likely to be entitled to compensation if his services are terminated. As Clause 497(3) makes clear, the right of the company to remove its auditor does not prejudice the auditor&#039;s contractual rights.

</p>

<a name="60314-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>It is important that members should have faith in the auditor, who is acting in their interests to help them monitor the stewardship of the directors. We do not want to oblige them in statute to give reasons for their decision. Such requirement could also create a risk of legal challenges to removal resolutions on the grounds that the notice did not contain tangible reasons. We believe that we should keep to the existing law in the Companies Act 1985, which is simply restated in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>However, Article 36 of the audit directive provides that auditors may be dismissed only where there are proper grounds and specifies that divergence of opinion on accounting treatment is not proper grounds. This is a difficult measure to fit into UK company law. As I have explained, our starting point is that the members appoint the auditors to protect their interests, and that if they lose faith in the auditors, the members should be able to replace them, whatever their reasons may be.
</p>

<a name="60314-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>We shall of course need to implement this provision of the directive, and we intend to consider carefully the best way of doing so, including consulting interested parties. It would be wrong to implement the directive in such a way that the protection of shareholders was reduced because they could not get rid of an auditor whom they no longer trusted.
</p>

<a name="60314-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I can understand that the amendment could be intended as a step towards implementation, but I should prefer to maintain the law as it is at present until we have decided on the overall approach to implementing the new requirement. I hope that that point dealt with the question raised by the noble Baroness.

<a name="60314-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply and thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this interesting debate. The Minister referred to the &quot;members&quot; losing faith with the auditors. It does not work like that. The members certainly appoint the auditors, but it is the directors who &quot;lose faith&quot;, probably choosing to have a different face to their auditors. What the amendment is trying to flush out is for the directors to tell the members why they have chosen to recommend that the members boot the auditors out.

Members to not lose faith with auditors&#151;I do not believe there is any example of members as a whole losing faith, but there are examples where directors and auditors have fallen out for various reasons that are not usually to do with losing faith. They usually relate to disagreements such as those referred to Part 1 of Article 36 of the eighth directive, with which, as the Minister explained, the Government have not the faintest idea what to do at this stage.

</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60314-42_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Goudie </b>   moved Amendment No. 321:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>Page 238, line 22, at end insert &quot;or if it would secure needless publicity for defamatory matter&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendments relate to Clauses 502, 505 and 507 as well, as they are all related. There is no clarity about what an abuse of rights would be and it is therefore unclear how the courts will determine that. Introducing the new wording and omitting to include the current exemption, where a court considers that a statement was for the purpose of securing needless publicity for defamatory matter, means that it would be very helpful to establish in case law, by the Jarvis and Easter cases, which would be irrelevant.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>In Clause 507, the rationale for using the words &quot;to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter&quot; is set out in form AR1, in addition to Clause 507(4), which refers to rights. Clause 506 sets out obligations, not rights, for an auditor. The amendment would correct this.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>While its intention is good, the change to the existing Companies Act makes it more difficult for auditors to be candid about the circumstances regarding their loss of officers. Members of the Committee would understand if that had to be done. The amendment would reinstate the relevant wording.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The amendment also suggests that form AR3 makes Clause 506(2) redundant. In Clause 506, the policy proposal from the Audit Quality Forum recommends a statement of circumstances which it is considered are connected to an auditor ceasing to hold office. This qualification is important as a statement from the auditors and involves judgment. The current wording does not make this clear. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60314-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I have added my name to the amendments in this group, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, and support everything that she has said. Case law is based on the current formulation, which talks about securing needless publicity for defamatory matter. We find it difficult to see what abuse other than defamation is likely to arise.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Amendment No. 322A, which is in my name, would, on a probing basis, delete subsection (9) from Clause 505. We find it difficult to understand what the rights conferred by the subsection refer to. If such rights are abused, a statement need not be sent out or read out at the meeting, so it is important to know precisely what rights are conferred by the provision.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Subsection (2) permits a resigning auditor to call on the directors to convene a general meeting to consider the circumstances of the resignation. The right of the outgoing auditor under this provision is thus to require a meeting of the members. Subsection (3) allows the auditor to request that a statement of reasons be <br>&nbsp;<br>

circulated. This is a right to ask, but it does not automatically result in a statement being circulated if, for example, if it is of an unreasonable length or late.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>My purpose in tabling Amendment No. 322A is to find out what rights are being abused. Is it the right to call the meeting or to ask to have a statement circulated? How does abuse of these kinds of rights&#151;the right to call a meeting or ask for circulation of reasons&#151;actually occur?
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>This is another facet of the problem of changing from a well-tried formulation, for which we have case law, to the more nebulous concept of abuse. That is why we support the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60314-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   In responding, I shall speak first to the first group. If the second group is to be moved formally, I will address it then.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Chapter 4 of Part 16 is headed, &quot;Removal, Resignation, etc of auditors&quot;. When someone ceases to be an auditor, for whatever reason, he generally has either an opportunity or a duty to make a statement to be sent out to members of the company. This is an important protection for shareholders, particularly minority shareholders. If an auditor is being forced out by the directors, or by the majority shareholders, perhaps because he has uncovered shortcomings in the way in which the company is being run, it is important that all shareholders know about it. Against this, if the auditor uses his statement merely to make personal attacks on the directors that are not helpful to the shareholders, the company has the right to go to court to argue that he should not be required to circulate it.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>At the moment, under the Companies Act, the test is based on whether the auditor is using the statement to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;secure needless publicity for defamatory matter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>In the generalised modernisation of the language in the Bill and the introduction of consistency across similar provisions, the wording has changed in the test of whether the rights conferred have been abused.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It is quite possible that the effect of the test will be the same when cases go to court; the courts have interpreted the existing wording as requiring an element of bad faith&#151;in other words, of abuse&#151;on the part of the auditor. But I accept that the new wording, based on abusing a right, is not always appropriate. For example, under Clause 506, as has been pointed out, an auditor of a quoted company who ceases to hold office, for whatever reasons, is required to give the company a statement of the circumstances of his leaving. This is a duty on the auditor rather than a right.
</p>

<a name="60314-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I know this is an important issue, and that it can have serious practical consequences. Getting the test right of whether an auditor statement can be suppressed is important, as there is a risk that unscrupulous directors will use court proceedings to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Baroness said: I have added my name to these amendments, although I was not expecting to do more than support the noble Baroness. I believe Amendment No. 324 returns the wording to existing company law, and invites the Government to say why they have shifted from the existing wording in connection with unquoted auditors&#039; resignation reasons. We seek to clarify why the Government think this formulation is better than the existing one, which is tried and tested.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Amendment No. 326 makes it clear that the test to be applied should be subjective, judged by the outgoing auditor, and not left unclear how the test should be judged. On behalf of both myself and the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60314-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The change that we are making in the requirements on auditors who are leaving companies is an important one, and I am happy to have the opportunity to explain it. It has to do with whether shareholders and creditors are given an explanation of why an auditor is no longer going to audit their company.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Under Section 394 of the Companies Act 1985, an auditor who ceases to hold office, for any reason, is required to make a statement of the circumstances only if he positively considers that there are circumstances that should be brought to the attention of the members or creditors of the company he is leaving. By contrast, for unquoted companies, Clause 506 of the Bill requires the auditor to make a statement as the general rule, with the exception that he need not make a statement if he positively decides there are no circumstances to be brought to the attention of the members or creditors.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC423"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC423</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We are making these changes because of the importance of ensuring that whenever auditors are leaving because they believe there is a problem with the accounts, or with the management of the company, they should make this known to the shareholders and to the public. The change from the 1985 Act shifts the balance in favour of disclosure. An undecided auditor at present might persuade himself that there are no circumstances that he considers should be brought to the attention of the members or creditors. He may find it more difficult to persuade himself that there are no circumstances that need be brought to their attention.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Amendments Nos. 324 and 325 would together revert the Bill to the existing position under the Act but I hope that I have persuaded the noble Baronesses that the change is a useful improvement.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Amendment No. 326 relates to quoted companies. Instead of just tipping the balance for quoted companies, auditors who are leaving are required to make a statement of circumstances in all cases, without any option. The amendment would change the content of the statement from,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;circumstances connected with his ceasing to hold office&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;circumstances which he considers are connected with his ceasing to hold office&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>This seems to me to weaken the requirement. Perhaps the noble Baronesses feel that it is necessary to protect the auditor from possible prosecution if he fails to record the absolutely correct circumstances, and so want to introduce an element of subjectivity. I do not believe that concern is justified. Subsection 506(6) provides that it is a defence for any ex-auditor to show that he took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence. I believe that this should be sufficient comfort for the auditor who is considering what circumstances to include in his statement.

<a name="60314-43_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I am grateful for that comprehensive reply by the Minister. I should have stated when I introduced the amendments that they were suggested to us by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

<p>
<a name="stpa_140"></a>So for those who were mystified by the nature of the amendment, that is the explanation. I apologise to the Committee for not spotting it earlier.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The UK Shareholders Association has concerns about members being kept in the dark about relationships between a company and its auditors. The association believes that the rights of shareholders to know of auditor problems, which often conceal much more significant issues about accounting treatments or internal controls should be given greater weight. The association would prefer there to be no ability of the company to withhold material, and so if defamation is involved the company has access to the normal legal routes for redress. Amendment No. 326A does not go that far&#151;it is a compromise&#151;and simply states that if the company applies to the court in order to suppress material prepared by the auditor, the members of the company should at least be made aware of that fact. I beg to move.
</p>

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60314-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   We have already discussed the right of a company to apply to the court if it believes that the statement deposited with it by a departing auditor should not be circulated to the members. It may be that the directors take the view that what the auditor has written will be of no value to the shareholders, is calculated simply to vent the auditor&#039;s anger at the directors, and could even damage the company if it were made public. On the other hand, as discussed earlier, the directors may be using the court process as a way of delaying the auditor&#039;s perfectly valid criticisms in the hope that if they are circulated rather later they will have lost their force.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Clause 507(3) requires the company to notify only the auditor if it applies to the court. Amendment No. 326A would require the company also to notify its shareholders and the other people to whom it would have sent the statement. I can see some attraction in this proposal if we are considering only the case where the directors are using the court process as a way of keeping from the shareholders information that would be valuable to them. Having to inform the shareholders that they were trying to block the auditor&#039;s statement could in itself be useful information to the shareholders.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC425"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC425</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60314-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>However, I believe there are two arguments against this. That an auditor is leaving a company is not a secret. If an auditor resigns, a copy of his notice of resignation is filed at Companies House. Certainly the astute shareholder will be aware of the resignation and, in a quoted company, should be expecting a statement of circumstances. If that does not appear, he could infer that the company is seeking to block its publication. It is also important to consider the case where the directors apply to the court because the auditor&#039;s statement is simply defamatory and of no value to the shareholders. It is not clear then what purpose is served by imposing on the company the cost of notifying every shareholder that it has applied to the court.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>This is an interesting proposal. I can sympathise with the reasons for putting it forward but, on balance, I do not think that it is the right way to go.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60314-43_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I am grateful for the way in which the Minister responded. He assumes that shareholders know rather a lot about the process of auditor resignation; that they know they can go to Companies House and look for a statement of reasons or, if they do not get anything, they can infer that there is no statement of reason or that it has been withheld. That is asking rather a lot of shareholders. The amendment was designed to give shareholders some form of useful information, which is at least that the company is applying for information to be withheld from them. In those terms, it was a very modest amendment and not what the UK Shareholders Association would prefer.
</p>

<a name="60314-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I hope that the Minister and his officials might look at the matter again as the Bill assumes that there is a very sophisticated knowledge of auditor resignation among shareholders. I assure the Minister that there is not even sophisticated knowledge about auditor resignations among your average auditor. As I shall come on to say under a later group of amendments, things are now so complicated that it stretches credibility to think that the whole of the outside world is expert on these details.

</p>

<a name="60314-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It is a requirement of Article 36 of the Statutory Audit Directive that both the company and the auditor inform the authority or authorities responsible for public oversight about the dismissal or resignation during the term of appointment and that they give an adequate explanation of the reasons thereof. However, subsection (3) allows for some of these statements to be sent to a recognised supervisory body and it is not clear whether the directive has been correctly implemented in this regard. If subsection (3)(b) was deleted, the statements would go to the Secretary of State or to a body to which the Secretary of State has delegated functions, not to a recognised supervisory body, and there would be no need for a definition of a &quot;major audit&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Clause 509(4) requires the auditor to send a statement of reasons where he has concluded that there are no circumstances to be brought to the attention of shareholders and creditors. Under Clause 506(2), the auditor would have deposited a statement that there are no circumstances. As to Clause 509(5) and the amendment which seeks to delete &quot;the company&quot;; I understand that that subsection requires that the company must send the same statement as the auditor. However, the statutory audit directive does not seem to preclude different statements being sent by the auditor and the audited entity. If, for example, there is a disagreement over the circumstances or the reasons for resignation or removal, the amendment would also reduce the administrative burden on companies.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>It is not clear what the position would be for auditors on disclosure of information as to an appropriate audit authority when a court action is being taken by a company to prevent circulation of the statement to shareholders. It is possible that the auditors must send the statement to the audit authority before the courts have reached a view under Clause 507. I therefore suggest that the statement be sent at the same time and be deposited at Companies House.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>In Clause 509(5), I seek to replace &quot;he&quot; with &quot;the auditor&quot;. This is a small drafting matter. As currently drafted, there may be some ambiguity about the identity of &quot;he&quot;. The amendment would rectify this. In subsection (6), I seek to replace &quot;person&quot; with &quot;company&quot;. The Bill deals with companies, not individuals, and the amendment would clarify any potential ambiguity.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The clause deals with two categories based on the type of company that was being audited. If it is a listed company, or another company of major public interest according to criteria issued by the Financial Reporting <br>&nbsp;<br>

Council, then all statements should be sent to the Secretary of State or to the body to which he has delegated auditor supervisory functions, namely the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy, part of the Financial Reporting Council, known as POBA. If, on the other hand, the company that the auditor has left was an unlisted company and not of major public interest, a statement need only be submitted in the case of an auditor&#039;s resignation or dismissal by the company and the statement is sent to the auditor&#039;s own supervisory body&#151;for example, one of the Institutes of Chartered Accountants&#151;rather than to POBA.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Amendments Nos. 328 and 329 would remove reference to the supervisory bodies so that, in practice, all the statements would go to POBA. In practice, I do not believe that burdening POBA, which is a relatively small organisation, with details of the circumstances of every auditor who resigns or is dismissed would be of value. The supervisory bodies may have a closer interest; some of the circumstances around dismissal may suggest a problem with an auditor, particularly if there is a pattern.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Amendment No. 330 would remove subsection (4), which deals with those auditors leaving unquoted companies who take the view that there are no circumstances that need be brought to the attention of the members or creditors of the company. In such a case, the auditor will nonetheless have to submit a statement of reasons for leaving to the appropriate audit authority. This is a requirement of the audit directive and I believe that it should be no great burden.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Amendments Nos. 331 and 332 point up a problem with subsection (5)&#151;that a company as well as the auditor is required to send the required statement to the appropriate audit authority, and the deadline in relation to major audits is the date by which the auditor is required to deposit the statement with the company. This means that the company is required to send the statement instantly, which is clearly impractical. We agree to consider Amendments Nos. 331 and 332. Incidentally, the reason that company and auditor are both required to send the statement is that when an auditor resigns or is dismissed, it is quite possible, as my noble friend acknowledged, that the auditor and company will have different accounts of the circumstances. But the current drafting provides for the company to send in the auditor&#039;s statement of circumstances and we shall consider what change may be required on this point.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Amendment No. 333 would replace the word &quot;he&quot; with the word &quot;auditor&quot; in subsection (5)(a). However, as there is no one else mentioned to whom the &quot;he&quot; could refer, I see no need for this. Amendment No. 334 on the other hand would replace the word &quot;person&quot; in subsection (6)(a) with the word &quot;company&quot;. As there is no other kind of person but a company that the subsection could apply to, this is an improvement and I am happy to accept Amendment No. 334.

<a name="60314-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>On the question of the audit directive, the relevant part of the directive is Article 36, which in the latest published draft refers to,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC428"></a>

</p>

<a name="60314-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I believe that the supervisory bodies can be included as they are part of the public oversight system for auditors.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60314-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I have two points to make. The first concerns Article 36 of the statutory audit directive and the first amendments, which require the company and the auditor to notify the public oversight authority. As the Minister explained, the clause is drafted so that the relevant supervisory body will be notified for non-major audits. However, if Article 36 requires notification to public oversight authorities, is the DTI happy that it has correctly transposed the directive? I am not normally greatly in favour of transposing directives at all but, since we have to do it, we might as well do it properly.
</p>

<a name="60314-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The second point is that the Minister resisted Amendment No. 332 because &quot;he&quot; could refer only to an auditor. An auditor is normally a firm, and it is normal to say &quot;it&quot; in relation to an auditor. It is very unnatural drafting to have &quot;he&quot; referring to an auditor. As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, says, it is sexist as well. However, we all know that the male encompasses the female in legal drafting and I am entirely comfortable with that. Perhaps the Minister will comment on those two points.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 334A seeks to amend Clause 510, which deals with the information to be given to accounting authorities by the appropriate audit authority in connection with auditor resignations. Under Clause 509(4), when an auditor resigns and says that there are no circumstances to be drawn to the attention of members or creditors, a statement of the reasons for the resignation has to be given to the appropriate authority. The amendment requires that the same statement should go also to the accounting authorities. Will the Minister confirm that there has been a drafting error or explain the rationale for partial information being sent to the accounting authorities? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60314-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 510 enables the audit authorities, the Public Oversight Board for Accountancy or one of the supervisory bodies, to send to the accounting authorities copies of the statements of circumstances that auditors deposit with a company they are leaving for circulation to shareholders and filing at Companies House. The accounting authorities are the Secretary of State and anyone the Secretary of State has authorised to apply to the court in respect of the revision of defective accounts&#151;that is, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, part of the Financial Reporting Council and known as the FRRP. Amendment No. 334A would extend the scope of this ability to the statements of reasons submitted to the audit authorities by auditors who have decided that there are no circumstances that need to be drawn to the attention of members or creditors.
</p>

<a name="60314-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I see no need for this. The purpose of the gateway is that the audit authorities can let the FRRP know about any important problems with accounts. This is bound to be a matter on which the auditor will have made a statement of circumstances for circulation. Statements of reasons are more likely to be when an auditor has left for entirely personal reasons, such as retirement or emigration, and are unlikely to be of interest to the accountancy authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>

<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is also sourced from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Under Clause 510, the accounting authorities are described as the Secretary of State and the body he has authorised&#151;which, I understand, will be the Financial Reporting Review Panel&#151;and it seems that the paperwork generated by the clause will have to go to both of them. I cannot believe that the DTI wants to be the recipient of all of this paperwork because that is why the FRRP exists. If the DTI does want to handle all of the paperwork, I hope that the Treasury will read the <i>Hansard</i> report of this debate and put a stop to this unnecessary cost&#151;because handling paper involves costs. I invite the Minister to say how he envisages the procedure will work and what the DTI expects to do with the paperwork, given that it will not be handling any substantive matters in relation to it.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The amendment simply seeks to replace &quot;and&quot; with &quot;or&quot; on a probing basis, but, if we are to stop this useless bureaucracy, the clause may need a little restructuring, which I will consider in the light of the Minister&#039;s reply. I beg to move.

There will be a statutory information flow. A person, or possibly even a whole section, in the DTI will be set up to receive, file, consider, monitor and summarise pieces of paper on which they will take no action, because that is what the FRRP is there for. I hope that the Minister will take this matter away with his Treasury hat on and discuss it with his DTI colleagues. This looks like unnecessary paper and, as we know, when paper flows to bureaucracies such as the DTI, they set up systems to handle them; they do not just put them in the bin&#151;civil servants are not trained to behave in that way. We need to root out this kind of duplicate activity, and so I hope very much that the Minister will, of his own volition, come back with an amendment on Report which says that unnecessary bureaucracy must be stopped.

Of course, we try to keep all the Companies Acts under review. If there are problems, we will investigate them more closely and take steps to remedy them if appropriate. Clauses 497 to 510 are as soundly based as the rest of the Bill. They will be improved in a number of ways following our discussion today and further minor improvements may be made at later stages. Many of the provisions are simple restatements of the existing law&#151;for example, on removal and resignation of auditors&#151;and much of the new material, particularly on auditor resignation statements, is based on the audit directive that will be adopted shortly. It would not therefore be appropriate to single out these sections for obligatory review, notwithstanding the tempting offer of a power to make amendments by order.

<a name="60314-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Clause 512 contains new powers for members to raise audit concerns. The issue is primarily about how small shareholders can engage with companies in which they have invested. If large shareholders have concerns, there tend to be other forms of dialogue and avenues for inquiry other than the annual accounts meetings that are rarely attended by the larger shareholders. It is in that light that we have tabled the amendments in this group, which have been suggested by the UK Shareholders Association.
</p>

<a name="60314-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>The UKSA is concerned that companies may use the threat of claiming that the rights are being abused to discourage requests for publication, because those making the requests might have to end up paying both sides&#039; costs under subsection (6). For that reason Amendments Nos. 334E and 334G make it clear that the court has to be satisfied that the rights are being &quot;seriously abused&quot; before the court will agree to non-publication of the concerns under subsection (5) or before the court awards costs under subsection (6).

</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="60314-47_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This group of amendments deals with the protection for the company in the unlikely event that shareholders use this new right not for its intended purpose&#151;that is, to raise concerns about the audit&#151;but to get publicity for some other purpose of their own. The ability of the company to go to court to avoid having to publish such material on its website is important, particularly if the material could be damaging to the company or to a third party.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>At present, the test is whether the rights conferred on shareholders by this clause &quot;are being abused&quot;. Amendment No. 334E would change that to &quot;are being seriously abused&quot;. I am sure that we can rely on the courts to take a proportionate view of the abuse and the extra word is therefore unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Subsection (6) enables the court to award costs against shareholders who have made an abusive request, even if the shareholders are not involved in the court proceedings. That may arise, for example, if a third party who is being defamed in the statement takes an action against the company to prevent it publishing, or continuing to publish, the material on its website. It may not happen often but, if a minority of shareholders behave in that way and involve the company in unnecessary costs, it is important that those shareholders pay rather than the company as a whole. I therefore believe that it would be a mistake to remove subsection (6), as proposed in Amendment No. 334F.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 334G would make the court&#039;s power to award costs against the shareholders conditional on their having seriously abused their rights. This is really unnecessary. The courts will consider awarding costs against the shareholders only if they have abused their rights, and there is no point in adding words to spell that out.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 334H amends subsection (4) of Clause 514. This little group of clauses is headed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Quoted companies: right of members to raise audit concerns at accounts meeting&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>That is very fine but the auditors seem to feature nowhere in the clauses, which are about the members, the company and websites.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Clause 514 says that when a company has been required to publish a statement of audit concerns on its website, the business of its account meeting may include that statement. Amendment No. 334H, which, again, has been suggested to us by the United Kingdom Shareholders&#039; Association, takes this one stage further and requires the auditors to attend the meeting and to be available to answer questions from the members. I hope the Government will accept that, without the involvement of the auditors, the raising of audit concerns will be a somewhat sterile business. I hope that they will therefore agree that the amendment makes good sense. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60314-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   As well as obliging a company to tell members about the possibility of a statement and preventing it charging the members for the cost of publication, Clause 514 deals with two consequences when a statement is published. First, the company must forward the statement to the auditor and, secondly, the statement becomes available for discussion at the accounts meeting. Frankly, that is as far as we want to go.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>In practice, we would expect the auditor to want to attend the meeting and we would expect the chairman to invite him to respond to the statement. Whether there was further discussion at the meeting would depend on the chairman&#039;s judgment, but company law generally leaves it to the chairman to run a meeting as he sees fit. We are very reluctant to prescribe in statute whom he may allow or require to speak; nor are we keen to compel the auditor to attend and be available. If we went down that road, we would have to provide an offence for an auditor who missed the meeting or who attended and perhaps did not sufficiently answer the questions that were put to him.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>We may not always be in a situation such as Starred Questions, where Ministers always give complete, succinct, relevant and erudite answers to questions. That may not always happen in these circumstances. I am sure that what the noble Lord and the noble Baroness are aiming at with Amendment No. 334H is what should, and probably will, happen in practice, but I do not think that we should add it to the Bill.

<a name="60314-47_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply but I suggest that it was classic DTI think&#151;that is, if you have got a problem, you have got to have another offence in the Bill. In fact, I think the Minister would want to add two offences to the Bill if this modest little amendment was accepted. That is the wrong way round of thinking about it.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>At the moment, there is no requirement for the auditor to attend or say anything at an annual meeting, and yet, by creating audit concerns, we have not squared the circle to ensure that the auditor is there. All the amendment seeks to do is to require the auditor to be there and to be prepared to speak. At the moment auditors do not speak, other than, perhaps, to read their audit report. But there is no statutory obligation for them to do that and it is not an invariable practice. The amendment seeks to take the procedure one stage further. Without it, that will not happen.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I hope the Minister will think again about this issue. If he really wants to take the practice forward there will have to be some shift in his position&#151;preferably without introducing another couple of statutory offences.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="60314-47_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   If you are going to impose extra duties and obligations for auditors to comply with, it seems to me that you potentially need sanctions to deal with non-compliance. So there has to be some sanction. I do not think there is a disagreement in practice as to what we think should happen&#151;and probably routinely will happen&#151;but, in our view, it is going a step too far to put it into the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The answering of questions is a genuine issue. I might have been a little flippant earlier, but if you have to make a judgment as to whether an auditor has answered the questions posed, it would open a whole minefield if that was a requirement in statute, with penalties if it was not complied with. It is a practical matter. We want to achieve a sensible outcome but doing so in the way proposed would be overly prescriptive. As the noble Baroness knows, we are a deregulating government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="60314-47_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I am so sorry that the Minister has fallen into DTI thinking through his brief exposure to the Bill and wants to create offences every time I suggest something constructive to take forward the relationship between members and the companies in which they invest. I suggest that he could perfectly well create a requirement for auditors to attend and answer questions without creating offences. If some kind of evil was spotted where auditors regularly turned up and gave rubbish answers, the Government might well want to respond to that, but I resist totally the notion that every time you create an obligation in a company&#039;s Bill you must create an equal and opposite offence. That is one of the reasons why the Bill is as long as it is.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now come to Chapter 6 of Part 16 of the Bill. The chapter contains a small group of clauses which are of immense significance to the auditing profession. Under Clause 518, auditors and companies will, for the first time, be able to agree liability limitation agreements whereby the amount that an auditor must pay in respect of negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in connection with the audit may be limited. The auditors have campaigned for a very long time for some relief from the way in which the current law works, which, in effect, makes the defendant with the deepest pockets&#151;usually the auditors and their insurers&#151;pay.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>But the devil, as usual, is in the detail, and so the amendments in this group, led by Amendment No. 334I, which I shall move, are designed to ensure that the Bill reflects a workable solution to the liability issues. In particular, we want to ensure that the Bill reflects the agreement that was reached between most of the interested parties&#151;the Government, investors, companies and auditors&#151;and that agreement was that the law should provide for agreements on proportionate liability.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="60314-48_time0"></a><h5>6 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I turn to the amendments in the group which bear my name. The first, Amendment No. 334I, is a small amendment so that a liability limitation agreement is defined as an agreement which limits or purports to limit liability. The current wording is that the agreement must only &quot;purport to limit&quot;. &quot;Purport&quot; is an odd verb. The dictionaries have several meanings. It can mean &quot;intend&quot; or &quot;profess&quot;, which is probably what it means here, but it can also have a meaning which is associated with false pretences, as in &quot;appear to do something, especially falsely or in a way that is not easy to believe&quot;. Let us assume that the word means &quot;intend&quot;. The clause would define a liability limitation agreement as an agreement which intended to limit the liability. But I believe that, whatever the intent of the parties or whatever they overtly profess in their agreement, if the agreement in fact limits liability, that agreement should be within the ambit of Chapter 6 and the restrictions that apply on limitation of liability agreements. That is the purport of Amendment No. 334I.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The other amendments in this group which I have tabled or to which I have added my name are directed in one way or another to ensure that Clauses 518 to 520 will allow proportionate liability agreements. The references to &quot;amount&quot; of liability throughout these clauses has caused significant doubts, based on legal advice, not only among the accounting firms and the Institute of Chartered Accountants but also at the CBI, as to whether proportionate agreements would be allowed. And so there is a call to get the drafting absolutely clear. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC439"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC439</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

aware that the DTI believes that its wording of the &quot;amount of a liability&quot; would allow a limitation agreement to be expressed in proportionate terms. I hope that it has now accepted that there is so much doubt among the communities that are actually affected by the clauses that some change is necessary to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Amendment No. 335 adds the words &quot;by whatever mechanism&quot; after &quot;purports&quot; in the first line of Clause 518, in the expectation that this would allow a proportionate formulation or mechanism. Amendments Nos. 336, 338, 341 and 343 replace the word &quot;amount&quot; with &quot;extent&quot; so that a liability limitation agreement is one which limits the extent of liability rather than its amount. Several of the other amendments are largely consequential on those amendments.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Other amendments in this group have been tabled by other noble Lords. Amendment No. 339A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and Amendment No. 340B, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, would both confine the judgment of &quot;fair and reasonable&quot; to the time of the agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, we also support those amendments.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I hope the Minister will confirm that the DTI has listened to the many arguments that have been put to it on these clauses. Chapter 6 will contain its own uncertainties going forward; for example, in relation to what the courts will determine to be fair and reasonable. All of the parties accept that. But to leave a basic uncertainty in the Bill about whether proportionate liability agreements will be allowed would be more than unfortunate&#151;and it can be easily avoided, as these amendments show. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="60314-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   I have two amendments in this group but begin by saying how much I support the noble Baroness&#039;s comments on this part of the Bill. I will not rehearse all of the reasons for including a limitation of liability provision in the Bill. The need for some level of protection for auditors from excessive and, in some cases, catastrophic claims has been clear and is widely supported. I think it is generally accepted that all parties agree that any mechanism to permit limitation of liability should as a minimum agree to the right of proportionality by contract.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I should say that I have had more lobbying from the middle-sized firms of accountants than I have from the big four on this issue. All the advice that I have seen&#151;including the opinions of several eminent QCs&#151;has been consistent: it is that what we have here, as it stands, would work as a capping mechanism. I should say to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General and his colleagues that, in my experience&#151;and I chair the audit committee of two FTSE 100 companies&#151;were we to have to work with a capping mechanism, the amount of the cap that we would have to put to our shareholders, with which we would feel comfortable and with which they would feel comfortable, would be so large as to take out almost everyone. In all circumstances it would probably act as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC440"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC440</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

no real cap at all because it would be sufficiently large to be way above any insurable limits and what most firms could stand.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I see two issues remaining with this part of the Bill. The first issue is that of enforceability. Amendment No. 337B seeks to add words to Clause 519(4) so that it reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;The &#039;principal terms&#039; of an agreement are terms specifying, or providing for the determination of&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I am told by my advisers that that simple amendment will ensure that proportionality by contract could be achieved. I may be wrong, but I rely totally on the eminent legal brains that I have consulted. I see that as a simple alternative, as it were, to replacing &quot;amount&quot; with &quot;extent&quot;. I support replacing &quot;amount&quot; with &quot;extent&quot;&#151;I think it is very clear&#151;but, if you want to keep &quot;extent&quot;, that simple amendment gives the same result.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>My second amendment in the group deals with the way in which the courts should assess the reasonableness of any limitation agreement. In order to ensure that that is achievable in practice, the court should at the date of trial take into account only those circumstances known at the time the contract was entered into. It specifically excludes from consideration later developments such as the insolvency of other wrongdoers and the like. The danger is otherwise that you will have a situation where hindsight arises and in many cases involving significant claims the auditor probably will be the only man&#151;or woman, for that matter&#151;left standing and the circumstances will have changed.
</p>

<a name="60314-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I have tabled Amendment No. 339A to deal with this point. Clause 520 would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;A liability limitation agreement is not effective . . . as it would have been fair and reasonable to specify at the time the agreement was entered into in all the circumstances of the case including&#151;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I think that the DTI has previously indicated that the intention of the Bill is that the court should at the date of trial take into account only those circumstances which were or ought to have been known at the date the contract was breached. Specifically, officials accept that the subsequent insolvency of other parties should be ignored when determining the reasonableness of the liability arrangements. The amendment would provide a welcome clarification of that amount.

They are not going to have the same defences as what I think one could tactfully call the &quot;big four&quot;, but they will be subject to the full hammer-blows and might of this clause. I hope the noble and learned Lord, or perhaps the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, coming to look at this amendment, will take on board what has been said by the leading practitioner&#151;if I can call him that&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Sharman.

<a name="60314-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </b>  I start by acknowledging that I entirely understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, introduced the amendment with the words that she did. This small group of sections is of immense importance to auditors, and I am well aware of the long debate there has been about auditors&#039; liability, whether there should be ways of limiting that liability and, if so, what they should be. I am told that, if these provisions pass, this will not in fact be the first time that auditors will be able to limit their liability, but apparently you have to go back a long way to find when that freedom existed. It will create an exception to what is an existing ban on a company&#039;s auditors limiting their liability to the company, with important protection for shareholders whose approval is needed. We will come on to the other provisions and safeguards.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>It is also part of the policy that there should be protection for those who might lose out if the limitation were unreasonably low, as the court will be able to replace the limitation in the contract with some other limitation the court considers to be fair and reasonable. So far so good, and so far we are in agreement. What these proposals intend to do&#151;and I say this a little bit generally, because this is the first time we have touched on these provisions in Committee&#151;is to try and strike the right balance between the interests of the company and its shareholders and the interests of auditors.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>So the policy is agreed. What is that policy? That company and auditor should have the option of agreeing a limitation on the auditor&#039;s liability; that it will be effective only if approved by shareholders; and, when damages are incurred following fault by the auditor, the agreement will limit the amount the auditor must bear, except if the court decides if that is unreasonable.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>What about the detail, though? I understand there to be two specific points that encompass all the amendments that stand in this grouping. The first concern is that the words we have used may be too restrictive; in particular, in limiting the limitation to a monetary amount, or a monetary amount derived by the use of a formula such as a number of multiples of an audit fee. I have had the benefit of seeing some of the opinions of learned counsel to which the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, referred, and I am grateful to those who provided them to us. There is a difference of view on this point. It is a perfectly respectable argument that the wording as it stands is not as restrictive as people think it may be. Having said that, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC442"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC442</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I accept that this is something we need to look at carefully in the light of the concerns that have been expressed about the precise words that are used. I shall come back to that.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The second concern may be more difficult to deal with. The other amendments that were put down seek to limit the consideration of what is fair and reasonable to things that either were in existence or might have been contemplated to be in existence at the time the agreement was entered into.

</p>

<a name="60314-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>In the course of this short debate, I have heard only one reason forward for why the limitation should be at that point. That reason, and I understand it, is that, if you look at it at the time when the judge is doling out the judgment, the auditor may be the only man or woman standing. The concern is that the alternative to taking reasonableness at the time of the agreement is that you take it at the time of judgment, and the judge may be concerned to see shareholders in the company properly compensated. That is not the only time one could take, however. There are moments in between&#151;for example, the position at the time of breach&#151;which may take account of the extent of the fault compared with the extent of the fault of others. This is not a criticism, but at the moment I have not heard sufficient explanation of why in the view of those who have moved these amendments the liability ought to be restricted only to those events that take place at the time of the agreement. That certainly is not the way the Government have seen this working.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>We need to take this part away as well. Even if we have not yet agreed among ourselves what the policy ought to be, I am not personally convinced that it is clear enough on the face of the Bill what that policy is. We need to make that clear. I wanted to indicate, in saying that we will take this away and consider it, that it is important to understand that I am not sure we are yet agreed what that policy should be, in the sense of agreement between noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and the Government.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>That is probably enough for me to say at this stage. We did not intend the Bill to limit liability to a fixed monetary amount by way of limitation. We see benefit in there being some process, for example, by which an amount might be met, and we can see merit in there being contractual freedom to agree other forms of limitation. We will take that away and look at the wording, even though the wording was thought to be apt to do what I have just said.
</p>

<a name="60314-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>It is also right that we take away the question of the time at which the test of fair and reasonable will be applied to the circumstances, but I would not want noble Lords in any way to think that it follows from that that the Government accept the logic of limiting it to those matters that were in existence at the time the agreement was entered into. I am not at all persuaded that this would be the right approach. I hope that is sufficient for the moment to indicate that <br>&nbsp;<br>

consideration will be given to those important clauses, but I cannot go any further at the moment in agreeing to any of the amendments.

<a name="60314-49_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   On behalf of all those who have taken part in this debate today, we have to say how encouraged we are by the noble and learned Lord&#039;s response. He said he will take away the issue of the clause permitting proportionate liability. I think we understand that the Government do not wish to confine the clause to proportionate liability, but to allow other forms of agreement, and I am sure that is entirely reasonable. I am also grateful to him for agreeing to take away the issue of the timing at which the judgment will be made. I understand the Minister&#039;s reservations, and I can see there could be arguments made for either case. It is fairly clear that it would not be right to have it at the time that the judgment is made&#151;but at what earlier point? I accept there may well be issues to be debated about the proper timing of that. I can do no more than say how pleased we are that the Government are firmly in receive mode on this, and are prepared, I hope, to consider amendments that can be made between now and Report so we can have a proper opportunity to consider them. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I am delighted to see that sub-paragraph (ii) of his amendment deals with Scotland; specifically with Sections 16(1)(b) and 17(1)(a) of the Act, which I have with me. But the noble and learned Lord will know that in these sections there is great talk of &quot;reasonableness&quot;, which he mentioned. That concerns me, and concerned me even then, 29 years ago, though not necessarily in relation to this. &quot;Reasonableness&quot; was intentionally discussed, but, in my mind, it was far more to do with retail trade and fitness for purpose.

Every word Lord Hailsham spoke is relevant to the auditing and accounting profession, and I hope the noble and learned Lord will reassure me that Amendment No. 337A covers reasonableness, particularly the aspects we covered in the last grouping. He gave assurances to my noble friend Lady Noakes, and indeed to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. It seemed to me that there was a risk there would be two categories of reasonableness: one for the big four, and one for what the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, called the &quot;middle-ranking firms&quot;. Will the noble and learned Lord confirm that he will look carefully at reasonableness as it was set out in 1977? Perhaps, <i>en passant</i>, he might see the interesting remarks of Lord Hailsham?

I am slightly intrigued by the noble Lord&#039;s reference to directing remarks to lawyers about reasonableness. I certainly want to see what was said about that. But, more generally and seriously, he is absolutely right that the purpose of this amendment is that the test for reasonableness, when it comes to the limitation agreements, will be that which is contained in this Act when it is passed, not the one we find in the Unfair Contract Terms Act, which is a much more general application. I hope that will reassure him that we will work to have provisions relating to reasonableness that apply to auditors with that particular context in mind, and that is what we will return to.

<a name="60314-50_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I have added my name to the amendments in this group. There is considerable concern that the list of matters is too restrictive, and the court needs to be able to take a much wider view of matters that are relevant other than those specifically related to the auditor&#039;s responsibilities, contractual obligations and professional standards. I hope the Government will see that the amendments being proposed, which either take the list out or use the word &quot;including&quot;, will give the courts more flexibility, which is necessary.

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60314-50_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I do not think it is that difficult to follow at all. Two things are clear. First, the important things the court will have to take into account in determining whether a limitation is fair and reasonable are those three things that are identified; namely, the auditors&#039; responsibilities, the nature and purposes of the auditor&#039;s contractual obligation to the company, and the professional standards expected of him Secondly, given that the Bill says,

<a name="60314-50_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Goudie: </b>   This clause limits the duration of liability limitation agreements to the audit of the accounts to only one financial year. I note that Clause 518 requires the shareholders to approve any agreement and Clause 523 gives members of the company power to terminate any agreement. Clause 521 provides for disclosure. Given those safeguards and the fair and reasonable override in Clause 520, it is unclear why such an absolute limitation is imposed on shareholders. This will be particularly onerous for private companies who are seeking to limit annual administration tasks. Shareholders themselves should be able to decide the appropriate duration of any limitation agreement.

<a name="60314-50_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I have added my name to this stand part Motion for all the reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, has stated. Annual agreements will be bureaucratic. In particular, they will put a disproportionate burden on small companies. Are the Government determined to keep the bureaucracy for larger companies, for quoted companies or just companies that are not small companies? Will they consider restricting the clause by one of the various size criteria of which there are several in the Bill already?
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60314-50_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   When I first spoke on an amendment relating to this part of the Bill, I said that it was important to have a balance between the interests of auditors in limiting their liability and the interests of shareholders. It seems to us that the interests of shareholders require that they should not find themselves locked into a long-term limitation liability agreement. It seems sensible to say that the limitation agreement should be limited to a single year. If the directors and auditors wish to continue to limit liability in succeeding financial years, either in the same way or a different way, they should come and get further approval for that.
</p>

<a name="60314-50_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>In public companies, the directors and auditors will need to go to shareholders for a fresh resolution for each financial year. In private companies, they will not necessarily need to do that, because Clause 519(1)(a) provides that the shareholders of a private company can waive the need for approval. As I understand it, it would be open for the company to pass a resolution waiving the need for shareholders&#039; approval; then the directors would need to renew the limitation liability agreement each year, but the shareholders might choose to give the directors authority for several years.
</p>

<a name="60314-50_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The principal point is that it is an important part of the balance not to lock in shareholders for too long. I do not accept the accusation of bureaucracy or of great cost. To the extent that either of those would be involved, they would be justified by the need to protect shareholders&#039; interests.

</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment which is designed to find out how the ability to terminate liability limitation agreements will work. Clause 523(3)(a) states that a termination of a limitation of liability agreement by the members does not affect the operation of the agreement in relation to acts or omissions occurring before the date on which the resolution is passed. That is common sense. However, subsection (3)(b) states that the termination does not affect acts or omissions occurring,

<a name="60314-50_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Since agreements can cover only a single financial year by virtue of Clause 522, the paragraph seems to override the effect of a termination under Clause 523(1). I shall give an example. An agreement is entered into in October 2006 to cover the financial year starting 1 January 2007. In December 2006, the company changes its mind and passes a resolution to end the contract. I think that the effect of subsection (3)(b) would be that the termination would not affect any acts or omissions after 1 January 2007, which is what the company would be trying to achieve. Can the Minister explain what the Government believe is the effect of paragraph (b), because I cannot make any sense of it? I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. A2, A3, A4 and A5. Clause 525(2) explains when an allotment or agreement to allot securities by a private company is presumed to be made with a view to it being offered to the public. It is derived from Section 58(3) of the Companies Act 1985 and no substantive change is intended. In particular, the presumption should be capable of rebuttal by evidence to the contrary. Section 58(3) of the Companies Act 1985 made that clear by including the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;unless the contrary is proved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>It would normally take express words to establish a conclusive presumption. However, in response to concerns expressed by the Law Society, and also as reflected in the amendments tabled by noble Lords, this amendment reinserts the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;Unless the contrary is proved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>This confirms that no change is intended and that the presumption is indeed capable of rebuttal. We are very grateful for the Law Society&#039;s detailed input in preparation of this part of the Bill. I believe that the amendment addresses the intention behind Amendments Nos. A2, A3, A4 and A5 and I therefore hope that they will not be pressed. I beg to move.

<a name="60314-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Perhaps I may raise a second, more general point, which arises in some of the amendments to Clauses 525. Since the introduction of the Companies Act 1985, the practice of what is known as a pre-IPO&#151;pre-initial public offering&#151;round of fundraising has emerged. A company will do this quite openly, and it will be part of the sales pitch to people who are participating that it will lead to an offer&#151;it might be an outright sale to another company but equally it could be an offer to the public. One issue that we would like to explore with the Government here and as we go through the Bill is the emergence of these new terms and new practices in which the idea of them subsequently being made available to the public is part of the sales pitch that leads to them being offered in the first place. It may occur within six, 12 or 18 months or some unspecified period; nevertheless, the offer to the public is part of the sales pitch in the first place. I should appreciate the Government&#039;s thinking on that because it underlies some of the other amendments that we will come to later.

</p>

<a name="60314-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Regarding the specific point about the emergence of pre-IPOs, as he referred to them, one has to look at the provisions in the Bill. There is a prohibition on public offers by a private company where they are, among other things, allotting, or agreeing to allot, any securities of the company with a view to their being offered to the public. One would have to work through the detail of any circumstance and I know that we shall be testing the meaning of a number of these provisions in due course before one can give a definitive answer. It would depend upon the facts of any given situation. Clearly there is no problem if the company is a PLC and one would normally assume that such arrangements would be in relation to a public company. If that were the case, there would be an assurance that these provisions would not bite&#151;but we are going to examine the detail of that in subsequent amendments.

<a name="stpa_276"></a>The noble Lord said: I want to stay with this clause because I wish to probe the Government&#039;s thinking on an issue that has been raised with us by Allen and Overy, a well-known City law firm.
</p>

<a name="60314-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Subsection (1)(b) purports, among other things, to deal with circumstances where a company agrees to allot one party&#151;possibly an investment bank&#151;shares which that party may then offer to the public. This ensures that the prohibition on a private company offering shares to the public cannot be easily circumvented. However, the presumption contained in subsection (2)(b) could apply where such a party then, possibly in breach of contract, offers those securities to the public. The result would be that the company, having acted properly in normal circumstances, would have to rebut the presumption&#151;that is, the company would, in a way, be &quot;guilty until proved innocent&quot;. This is not fair or correct. Our amendment, therefore, would disapply the presumption in subsection (2)(b) from circumstances such as those, so that a company would not have to exonerate itself where it has done no wrong. I beg to move.
 </p>


<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60314-51_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Where the presumption in subsection (2) applies, it will be for the company to prove on the balance of probabilities that the allotment or agreement to allot shares or debentures was not made with a view to their being offered to the public.
</p>

<a name="60314-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The amendment sets out circumstances in which the presumption is not to apply. But it should already be the case that when a company is able to show the matters set out in the amendment, that should suffice to rebut the presumption in any event, provided the contractual obligations or undertakings were genuine. The presumption may also be rebutted in other circumstances not covered by the amendment&#151;for example, when the company shows that at the time the allotment or agreement to allot was made there was a mutual intention that the subscriber would hold on to the shares for at least six months. Another example might be where the company shows that on the allotment it was provided that the whole of the consideration was to have been received by the company.
</p>

<a name="60314-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>This shows that it is not necessary for the company to impose contractual obligations on the recipients of its shares in order to overcome the presumption. But of course the existence and enforcement of such contractual obligations or undertakings against the offer of its shares to the public will make it much easier to rebut the presumption. Indeed, the amendment might make it harder for the company to rebut the presumption in those cases falling within the circumstances covered by the amendment, but not quite satisfying all the requirements it imposes&#151;for example, where the company is unable to show that it took all reasonable steps to enforce the undertaking or obligation.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment has come to us from the Law Society. Its purpose is to clarify the meaning of subsection (3)(a). The subsection provides an exemption from the prohibition on private companies offering securities to the public when, in summary, the company is to reregister as a public company. The &quot;in pursuance of arrangement&quot; formulation appears far too vague; we question whether it is meant to capture anything other than entering into agreements to allot conditional on reregistration before allotment. If that is the case, what would happen if the company was unable to reregister but was obliged to continue with the allotment? It appears in those circumstances that no contravention would have taken place and that the allotment would stand. Again, I question why that would be. I realise that this is a very technical area and that the Minister may want to take it away and think about it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="60314-52_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Subsection (3)(a) of Clause 525 ensures that the prohibition on offering shares or debentures to the public does not apply if the offer or the agreement to allot shares or debentures is done in good faith in pursuance of arrangements under which the company is to reregister as a public company before the shares or debentures are allotted. Subsection (3)(b) similarly exempts offers which include as part of their terms an undertaking by the company to reregister as a public company within six months of the offer. This enables a private company intending to go public to make an offer to the public before it has completed the formalities of reregistration, without breaching clause.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The exemption also recognises that despite the good faith intentions of the company, the reregistration application might fail or the arrangements to reregister might be derailed. Circumstances can change; for example, the company might suffer an unexpected downturn in trading, such that it no longer meets the requirements of Clause 92 as regards its net assets. In those cases, we do not consider that the company should be held at fault under these clauses for the things it has done in the good faith expectation that it would become a public company.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>Under subsection (3)(a), offers or agreements to allot shares or debentures will fall within the exemption if they are made in good faith in pursuance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC452"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC452</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of arrangements under which the company is to reregister as a public company. These arrangements do not need to be legally binding, but they do need to be a genuine intention or plan on the part of the company. The offer or agreement to allot must form a part of the arrangements leading to the reregistration of the company as a public company. There must therefore be an expectation on the part of the company in making the offer or agreement to allot that, as part of the overall process the company will reregister as a public company, although this expectation need not be intended to have legal force.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The amendment would restrict this aspect of the exemption, so that the exemption is only available if the company makes an offer, which is conditional upon its reregistration as a public company or, as is the case under subsection (3)(b), the company gives an undertaking to reregister as a public company. Both these scenarios are already included in the exemption, but subsection (3) goes further in allowing offers and agreements to allot made in good faith in pursuance of arrangements to reregister, whether or not those arrangements are legally binding and whether or not the reregistration eventually takes place.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>As long as the company is acting in good faith, in the genuine expectation that it will, as part of the course of action it has embarked upon, reregister as a public company, we consider it appropriate that the exemption should apply. The company should not have to worry about breaching the prohibition on public offers in such circumstances; nor do we consider that the company should be held in breach of this clause for the actions it has carried out in good faith, if it subsequently transpires that it is unable to reregister as a public company or, due to changing circumstances, it is no longer desirable for it to do so.

<a name="60314-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The government amendments put Clause 525 back into line with the approach currently taken in Section 81 of the Companies Act 1985 by applying the prohibition on public offers to shares and debentures as defined in Section 744 of the Companies Act 1985. The amendments delete the definition of securities in subsection (5) and insert a new subsection (6) that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC453"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC453</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

defines securities as meaning shares or debentures for the purposes of this chapter. This is to replace the wider definition of securities in Clause 527.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Our intention in expanding the definition of securities beyond shares and debentures had been to prevent private companies from offering to the public any security which gave the holder rights in relation to the company which were equivalent to those conferred by a share, or which entitled the holder to acquire shares in the company. Therefore, Clause 527 adopted the wider definition of securities used in Section 228(6) of the Companies Act 1985. Subsequent feedback suggests that this change was not helpful and could create uncertainty. It was suggested that the current law already provides sufficient protection.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The amendments do not mean that companies can simply avoid the prohibition on public offers by issuing such things as warrants, options, or convertible debt. These kinds of securities may confer an entitlement on the holder to acquire shares indirectly. The prohibition may apply if they are calculated to result indirectly in shares or debentures becoming available to the public. That is because the prohibition applies to offers of shares or debentures, and allotments or agreements to allot shares or debentures, by whatever means this is done. That can include where the offer, allotment or agreement to allot shares or debentures is done indirectly by way of warrant, option or otherwise. We have concluded that this is sufficient, and it would not be helpful to have a wider definition of securities than currently applies. So these government amendments reverse this change.
</p>

<a name="60314-52_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>On the amendments tabled by noble Lords at lines 24 and 31 of Clause 526, the extension in the definition of securities beyond shares and debentures made a good argument for amendments widening the definition of, &quot;person already connected with the company&quot; set out in subsection (6) of Clause 526. However, as we are now reversing this change so that securities are defined as shares and debentures, I hope the noble Lords will now feel able to withdraw those amendments. Holders of shares and debentures are already included in the definition of, &quot;person already connected with the company&quot;, whether they are directors or not. I beg to move.

I understand exactly what the Minister was saying&#151;that we are going back to Section 81 for the 1985 Act, because, as he said, the present situation created uncertainty. Our feeling was that the financial world is moving on fast, so wider definitions of securities were not inappropriate given how derivatives and other instruments had developed in the period since 1985 and will, presumably, develop in other ways.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>The noble Lord said: Under Clause 526, an &quot;offer to the public&quot; is to be defined as including an offer to any section of the public.

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>We argue that we should take this opportunity to align the definition in this Bill with the recently adopted definition in Section 102B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, without then applying the exemptions in Section 86 of that Act. Those exemptions are that in certain circumstances, although securities are clearly being offered to the public, the company making the offer does not need to produce a formal prospectus which has to be approved by the FSA. Those conditions include offers to fewer than 100 persons, offers directed at qualified investors only and offers where the minimum consideration must be &#8364;50,000 or more.

</p>

<a name="60314-53_para4"></a>

The amendment would insert in the Bill the definition found in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, thereby avoiding any issues that the current wording may cause were it left in place.

It may be helpful if I give some explanation of the significance of these provisions and of our approach before turning to the specific amendment.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The key distinction between public and private companies is that private companies are prohibited from offering their shares to the public. As the Company Law Review recognised, there is good reason to have tighter regulation of companies that have access to the capital markets because of their greater economic potential and greater agency problems.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Where companies are closely held, it is reasonable to assume that people can know about the company. We recognise that some private companies are very large&#151;they have generally grown organically, with their shareholder bases enlarging because of employee share schemes and the like, or offers to the family, but they cannot do so by making public offers. That means that the legislation can provide processes appropriate to the different sorts of company. Indeed, in this Bill, we have substantially further deregulated for private companies. We believe it is right in principle that if companies wish to seek new investors, however experienced, without a close connection, they should become a public company to do so. That does not mean that they need to secure a listing, but it does mean that it brings them within regulation appropriate for a company with a wider shareholder base.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Regarding the definition of an &quot;offer to the public&quot;, most companies will not need to consider this issue, as companies with a very small number of shareholders and no intention of raising equity funding are unlikely to come close to crossing the dividing line, but it is important for private companies which are expanding and embarking on financial transactions.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Clause 526 does not comprehensively define what is meant by &quot;offer to the public&quot;, but subsection (2) makes it clear that the concept includes an offer to any section of the public, however selected. Subsections (3) to (7) then cut it back by excepting specified kinds of offer.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The amendment would delete subsection (2), which is derived from Section 742A(1) of the Companies Act 1985, and can be traced all the way back to Section 68 of the Companies Act 1947. The purpose of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

subsection is to ensure that the offer does not have to be open to the world at large before there can be an offer to the public. That is crucial. It is not difficult to see that if you could make an offer to, say, 100 investment managers and they in turn could sell on the shares, it could be a very wide public offer.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The absence of the subsection would not mean that the offer has to be made to everyone for the prohibition to apply, but it might mean that the prohibition applied only if the offer was open to anyone who chose to come in, whether the offer was directed at them or not&#151;in other words, it was capable of being acted upon by any member of the public. In our view, the prohibition needs to be wider than that.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The words to be inserted by the amendment explain that there is an offer if there is a communication to any person that presents sufficient information on the securities to be offered, and the terms on which they are offered, to enable an investor to decide to buy or subscribe for the securities in question. The amendment is taken from Section 102B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, but we do not consider it apt in this context. A later amendment also borrows from the 2000 Act. On the face of it, it would seem attractive to use common definitions. We certainly need to watch to see that there is not an unnecessary difference, but the two statutes are directed at rather different things. In the case of the Financial Services and Markets Act, the concern is to ensure that potential investors are properly informed, inappropriate investments are not marketed to the unwary and the financial markets operate effectively and fairly. This is very different from the company perspective of the Bill, as I have outlined.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>For there to be an offer of shares or debentures to the public for the purposes of these clauses, there must be an offer. It need not be a contractual offer. Often a company will invite people to take up shares or debentures, and those responding might be making the contractual offer to take them up, which may be accepted by the company. The initial invitation should be capable of being an offer for the purposes of these clauses. What matters is not the amount of information provided by the company but whether the company is making its shares available to the public. On the other hand, perversely, the amendment would mean that an offer that did not provide sufficient information would not be an &quot;offer to the public&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The amendment also suggests that if the communication contains sufficient information, it will automatically be an offer to the public, even if it would not otherwise be so regarded under the current law or under the Bill. This goes too far.
</p>

<a name="60314-53_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>The final words to be inserted by the amendment explain that the communication may be made in any form and by any means. We do not consider these words to be necessary in this case. Clause 526 does not place any restrictions on the form or manner of the offer, nor is there reason to imply any. In summary, the definition put forward by this amendment would not be sufficient for the important purposes it has to serve. <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60314-54_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The clause specifies that an offer is not an offer to the public if,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;in all the circumstances&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in securities of the company becoming available to persons other than those receiving the offer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-54_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>So, coming back to my IPO point, it is difficult to see how fund-raising, where the exit strategy is to pursue an offering of the shares to the public in the short to medium term, can be regarded other than as indirectly making the securities available to the public.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>An example of where this part of the Bill lacks certainty is where a private company is bought by a private equity house with the view of turning it into a more successful business and then selling it to realise its investment. Obviously it may do this by means of a direct sale to a corporate inquirer but very often it may be by means of an IPO. We would like a little more detail from the Government as to whether such an action is caught by the clause. If it is, it will make a huge difference to the way in which the industry <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="60314-54_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The exemptions set out in subsections (3) to (5) are not exhaustive. This means that an offer will not necessarily be an offer to the public even if it does not fall within one of those exemptions. But the exemptions provide comfort that an offer falling within them will not be regarded as an offer to the public. Offers which might otherwise be prohibited are excluded from the public offer prohibition as long as the requirements imposed under the various subsections are met.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Subsection (3), which is the subject of this amendment, is derived from Section 742A of the Companies Act 1985. In order to fall within the exemption in subsection (3) all the circumstances need to be taken into account. Under subsection (3)(a), the shares or debentures must not be calculated to become available to persons other than those to whom the offer is made. This imposes an objective test of the intentions of the company. The words &quot;directly or indirectly&quot; capture offers of shares or debentures by whatever means they are made.
<a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="60314-54_time0"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60314-54_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Subsection (3)(b) expands the exemption to include any other offers that are the private concern of the persons involved. The exemption is not available where the intention is that the shares are to become available to other persons. Of course, the shares may be transferable, but the transfer to other persons should not be part of the arrangements or motivation for the offer by the company.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Subsection (3) emphasises that if an offer is private in nature, it will not be an offer to the public&#151;for example, where an offer is made to particular individuals and the company does not intend anyone other than them to take up the shares. In contrast, if an offer is made to an investment manager with the intention that he will sell the shares to a range of investors, that could involve an offer to the public. We believe that this subsection is necessary and I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Specifically in relation to an IPO with an exit strategy in the short to medium term, we believe that that is capable of being an offer to the public. As ever, the easy answer is to have a public company to start with or to convert to a public company, as these issues would not then arise. Again, obviously it depends on the specific circumstances but, if there is a clear exit strategy at the point of the offer, there has to be a clear risk.

<p><a name="st_181"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment concerns subsection (3) of Clause 526. We want to highlight another issue that has been brought to our attention by the City firm. The clause defines what is meant by an &quot;offer to the public&quot; so as to facilitate the interpretation of the prohibition of such offers by private companies contained in Clause 525.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The intention of subsection (3)(a) appears to be to carve out of the prohibition offers to possibly large numbers of people who have been specifically identified by a company&#151;perhaps a group of known or selected investors or business associates. I think that the Minister partly touched on this in his response to my previous amendment.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The concern that has been put to us is that the drafting is now so wide that it risks rendering the principal prohibition ineffective. For example, it is argued to us that a specifically addressed mailshot to a large number of unknown people, not selected for any particular reason, would almost certainly be calculated to result in securities not becoming available to anyone other than them. Surely it is not the Government&#039;s intention that such an action should be exempt from the prohibition, but that is one interpretation of the Bill as currently drafted.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Our amendment is aimed to tighten up subsection (3)(a) so that only offers made to those,

</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="60314-54_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   As we have been discussing, subsection (3)(a) is an exemption for offers made only to particular persons. This is recognised by Amendment No. A9A, which would replace the paragraph with different words. However, the amendment does not recognise the further requirements that are imposed before the exemption can apply. It is not enough that the offer is made only to the particular persons receiving the offer; what matters is that the offer to the specifically selected persons should not be done with the aim of making the shares or debentures of the company available to other people.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>We believe that, rather than seek to narrow it as the noble Lord intends, the amendment would greatly widen the exemption, making it easier for a private company to evade the public offer prohibition and make its shares available to the public. For example, the specifically selected person might be a financial adviser, proposing to offer the shares to his clients specifically selected by him. I believe the current wording of subsection (3) is appropriate, and that that will satisfy the noble Lord. I do not believe we have changed the existing position.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>With regard to the mailshot and whether that would be covered, I struggle to see why Clause 526(3) would deal with that situation, because it is necessary to look at the persons who are receiving the offer and to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC460"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC460</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prohibit it going beyond those persons. I do not think a mailshot to non-identified persons comes within that, although I am probably going to be corrected by the people behind me. The key, or otherwise, is in paragraph (b), which makes clear that the selected persons have to be of private concern.

<a name="60314-54_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I will speak to the others grouped with it; namely, Amendments Nos. A11, A12, A13, A15, A16, A19 and A20.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>They are all put to us by the Law Society, and are intended to clarify definitions within Clause 526. Amendments Nos. A10, A15 and A19 take out the word &quot;calculated&quot; and insert &quot;intended&quot; in its place. The purpose here is to ensure that the test to be applied should be one of intent rather than an objective test of whether the securities are likely to get into the hands of the public at some stage. On the face of it, the word &quot;calculated&quot; implies that there must be some intent on the part of the company making the offer, and I understand there is judicial authority to the effect that the word &quot;calculated&quot; should be read as meaning &quot;likely&quot;, which applies a wholly objective test. The jurisprudence for this is Crafter v Webster 1980, and Customglass Boats v Salthouse Bros 1976. It is with a great deal of trepidation that I quote law cases, and I do so only because the Attorney-General is not here.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>In the case of a private company offering shares by way of rights to its own shareholders, the directors would, as the clause is currently drafted, have to assess the likelihood of any shares being subsequently transferred to members of the public, an assessment that may in practice be almost impossible to make, unless there are very strict restrictions on transfer, which could be to the detriment of the shareholders.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. A11 and A16 is to apply the test of whether the offer might be to the public to the circumstances surrounding the offer itself, rather than having to take account of circumstances that may occur at any time after the offer. In order to take advantage of the relief from the general prohibition offered by subsection (3), the amendment requires the company to assess the likelihood of the shares being offered becoming available to persons other than those to whom the offer is made. That could happen because the rights under the offer are transferable, or the securities offered are not, subject to any restrictions on transfer, once issued to the accepter of the offer. In the latter case it is quite possible that the securities may be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC461"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC461</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

transferred on at a later date, and if that is the case, even though the transfer would be at the behest of the allottee of the securities and outside the control of the company, the relief would not apply. Since it is the nature of the offer itself that should determine whether the company is required to re-register as a public company, the test should relate to whether the securities are available under the offer to third parties.

</p>

<a name="60314-54_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a> The test in subsection (4) is new. Under the existing legislation, which is Section 742A of the 1985 Act, an offer is treated as a domestic concern, and therefore not as an offer to the public, if it is made to an existing member, employee or other connected persons on terms that it may be renounced only in favour of another member or connected person. That would permit rights issues by a private company. However, subsection (4)(c) imposes an additional test of whether the relevant securities are calculated&#151;that is, likely, subject to Amendment No. A15&#151;to become available to other persons not connected with the company. For the company to take advantage of the relief from the general prohibition offered by subsection (4), the clause requires it to assess the likelihood of the shares offered becoming available to other unconnected persons. That could happen because the rights under the offer are transferable or because the securities offered, once issued to the acceptor of the offer, are not subject to any restrictions on transfer. In the latter case, it is quite possible that the securities may be transferred on at a later date. If that were the case the relief would not apply, even though the transfer would again be at the behest of the allottee of the securities and outside the control of the company. That could result in a rights issue by a private company being prohibited unless the shares are subject to very strict transfer restrictions. That seems unduly restrictive. Since it is the nature of the offer that should determine whether the company is required to reregister as a public company, the test should relate to whether the securities are available under the offer to third parties.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Amendment No. A12 would clarify whether paragraphs (a) and (b) of Clause 526(3) are distinct exemptions or whether the first exemption is an example of what is a private concern. The word &quot;otherwise&quot; appeared in the Companies Act 1948 and in the original 1985 Act. The received view was that the two exemptions should be interpreted as being distinct. That was reflected in Section 742A of the 1985 Act as inserted by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Commencements and Repeals) Order 2001, where the word &quot;otherwise&quot; was omitted. There seems to be no good reason to revert to the more uncertain wording of the pre-2001 legislation.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Amendment No. A13 is a probing amendment which is designed to establish whether the Minister believes that the expression &quot;private concern&quot; has a meaning different from the expression &quot;domestic concern&quot;, which is used in the existing legislation. There is no legislative clarity on what precisely is meant by the expression &quot;domestic concern&quot;, although an Australian case in 1985, Corporate Affairs Commission v Australian Central Credit Union, held <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC462"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC462</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that where there was a subsisting relationship between the offerees and offeror, or a rational connection between a common characteristic of the offerees and the offer made prior to the making of the offer, the offerees did not constitute a section of the public. This test is generally applied to establish whether, under the existing law, the offer can be treated as a domestic concern. However, the position is not clear, and it is made less clear by the wording in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60314-54_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>Amendment No. A20 is in line with Amendment No. A19. Its purpose is to clarify and put on a statutory footing the number of persons to whom an offer may be made without the offer being treated as being made to the public. The amendment is designed to raise the general issue of whether there should be some alignment of the various legislative provisions governing the offer of securities to the public as indicated in the introduction to the briefing on Part 17 of the Bill.

I very much understand the concern of the Law Society that it is desirable for there to be clarity. However, we do not want to provide loopholes in this area; nor do we want to provide unnecessary rigidity. Clause 526 is essentially based on the existing law. I know there are differing views, but I believe that it strikes the right balance.

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Amendments Nos. A10, A15 and A19 relate to replacing the word &quot;calculated&quot; with &quot;intended&quot; every time it appears in the various exemptions setting out what is not to be regarded as an offer to the public.

</p>

<a name="60314-55_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>We consider that the word &quot;calculated&quot; in this context should bear its ordinary and natural meaning.

<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>imposes an objective test. If it came to court, an objective assessment would be required of whether the motivation or purpose behind the offer was to make the shares or debentures available to persons other than those receiving the offer.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>The courts are required to take into account the circumstances of the offer and the identity of the persons making and receiving it. Its effect is that, in determining whether an offer is to be regarded as not made to the public, one has to consider what can properly be regarded as the calculated results of the offer itself. It is not a question of how likely or probable it was that the shares would become available <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC463"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC463</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to other persons; nor is it a question of whether the shares did in fact become available to other persons. Instead, the likelihood of the shares becoming available to other persons may be one of the circumstances that the court takes into account, along with anything else that the person making the offer said or did. This all goes to the evidence enabling the court to make its judgment. As we want the provision to provide an objective test of intentions, we believe that &quot;calculated&quot; is the correct word.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I turn now to the amendments in respect of the insertion of the term &quot;as part of the offer&quot;. Subsections (3) to (5) of Clause 526 contain a number of exemptions setting out various circumstances in which an offer will not be regarded as an offer to the public. As we understand it, the concern behind these amendments is that a company should not be held responsible for what the recipients of its shares or debentures do with them after they have received them. We agree with that, as long as it was not a part of the arrangements or understanding reached at the time the offer was made that the recipient would pass the shares or debentures on to persons falling outside the exemption.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Of course, a company may offer shares with the expectation that the recipients will one day sell them to someone else, but that does not prevent the exemptions applying. It is not necessary for a company to restrict the transferability of its shares or debentures in order for these exemptions to apply. For example, where the offer is made to a member&#151;not so that the member can take up the shares for himself but so that he can take up the shares and pass them on to someone falling outside the exemption&#151;the exemptions should not apply. That does not mean that the recipient can never sell the shares or debentures to such persons, but it is the intentions, arrangements and understandings between the company and the recipient at the time of the offer that matter. What is important is the private character of the offer.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The amendments are unnecessary as the exemptions should already be construed in that way. We are aware that the Law Society has concerns that the matter is not free from doubt. There have been very few cases, but the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-55_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>can be traced back to Section 68 of the Companies Act 1947. The amendments seek to make the position more explicit but, in doing so, they go too far by suggesting that it is only the terms of the offer that matter. The amendments appear to widen the exemption to include any offer, as long as it is not an express or implied part of the offer that the shares or debentures are made available by the recipient to persons falling outside the exemption.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>The next amendment would leave out the term &quot;otherwise&quot; from Clause 526(3)(b). Under this subsection, an offer is not to be regarded as an offer to the public, even if it would otherwise be so regarded, if certain requirements are met. Subsection (3) is derived from Section 742A(2) of the Companies Act 1985. As <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC464"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column GC464</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the amendment highlights, that section does not currently include the word &quot;otherwise&quot;. The absence of this word suggests that the section should be read as containing two distinct exemptions. We see no reason why they need to be distinct, and indeed it might narrow their meaning if this were so regarded. Section 742A was inserted into the Companies Act 1985 relatively recently as a consequential amendment under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As a consequential amendment, it was not intended to make any substantive change to the meaning of the provision, which previously appeared in Section 60(1) of the Companies Act 1985. From the Companies Act 1947 until the change made in 2001, the word &quot;otherwise&quot; had always appeared in the provision.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>The circumstances set out in subsection (3) which cause an offer not to be regarded as an offer to the public are not entirely distinct. One of the circumstances in which an offer is not to be treated as an offer to the public is that it is a private concern. An offer made to a particular individual, with the intention that only he should take up and retain the shares, is one of the clearest examples of something that is purely the private concern of the person concerned. To suggest that this scenario is completely distinct from the exemption for matters of private concern might serve only to narrow that exemption.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>The final amendment relates to the expression &quot;private concern&quot;. Subsection (3)(b) of Clause 526 explains that an offer of shares or debentures is not to be regarded as an offer to the public if the offer can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances, as being a private concern of the person receiving it and the person making it. This provision is derived from Section 742A(2)(b) of the Companies Act 1985. As the amendment highlights, that section refers to &quot;domestic&quot; concern rather than to &quot;private&quot; concern. The use of the phrase &quot;domestic concern&quot; can be traced back to Section 68 of the Companies Act 1947. Our aim in changing the word was simply to update the language used in the Bill to reflect modern usage. The phrase &quot;domestic concern&quot; was never intended to refer only to family matters. But modern dictionaries such as the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> define it in terms of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;of the home, household or family affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60314-55_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The phrase &quot;private concern&quot;, in our view, better describes what is intended&#151;private being, as it is, the opposite of public. Private concern encapsulates family matters but also anything else not open to the public. As was the intention back in 1947 when the reference to &quot;domestic concern&quot; first appeared, offers for example between members of the same firm, or even offers to someone in a similar line of business who might be interested, should all be capable of falling within the exclusion. It is of course all a question of degree, and a wide offer to a large number of people not known to the persons making the offer would clearly not be a domestic or private concern of the persons involved.
</p>

<a name="60314-55_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I hope that by going into this level of detail noble Lords will understand the motivation behind the current drafting and that these amendments will not be <br>&nbsp;<br>

We touched on that in an earlier amendment and I think we are going to hit it again in a subsequent amendment. Perhaps we can pick it up there.

<a name="60314-56_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>On 3 January this year the<i> Sun</i> newspaper published allegations made by an ex-employee about working practices at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s (IND&#039;s) Public Enquiry Office (PEO) in Croydon. On 9 January I said that Tim Gbedemah, a non-executive director of IND, would lead a formal inquiry into these allegations, with the following terms of reference:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>&quot;To investigate the allegations about practices within the Public Enquiry Office at Lunar House in Croydon, which Mr Anthony Pamnani was reported to have made by the <i>Sun</i> newspaper on 3 January; to establish, as far as possible, their substance; and to make any recommendations for further action to the Director General of IND, in the light of any findings.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60314-56_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The report has now been completed and is available      in full via the IND internet site, www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk. A copy has also been laid in the House of Commons Library.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>I am pleased to say that the investigation found no evidence to support the <i>Sun</i>&#039;s central allegation that there was a corruption &quot;racket&quot; in the public enquiry office involving &quot;sex for visas&quot;. Some isolated <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS92"></a>

<b>14 Mar 2006 : Column WS92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

incidents of unprofessional behaviour have been identified and the report indicates there may be evidence of further misconduct by some members of staff. It also identified some failures to follow the correct procedures for carrying out security checks on   certain applicants. We take these findings very seriously. We will now ensure that appropriate action is taken to address them, including where necessary taking disciplinary action.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Importantly, the report also makes the point that its findings must be seen in context and acknowledges the significant improvements that have been made. In the period under examination the PEO decided around half a million cases. We are justifiably proud of the hard work and professionalism of the overwhelming majority of staff in the public enquiry office and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The director general of IND and I are very grateful for Mr Gbedemah&#039;s work. We accept all of his recommendations and I am asking the director-general to put together an action plan to take them forward. We are committed to improving continually and we will look at how we can positively apply the lessons learnt across the whole of IND.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60314-56_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  I would like to inform the House that the UK and the   US withdrew our monitors from the Jericho Monitoring Mission on 14 March. As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) made clear in his Statement to the other place on 29 April 2002 (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 668), it is the prime responsibility of the Palestinian Authority to ensure the personal security of the United States and United Kingdom monitors. Over the past months it has become increasingly clear that the Palestinian Authority is unable to do this.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The UK and the US have repeatedly raised our concerns over the security of our monitors with the Palestinian Authority and urged it to meet its obligations under the Ramallah agreement. Unfortunately, there has been no improvement. We therefore issued a joint US/UK letter to President Abbas on 8 March 2006. This letter said that we would have to terminate our involvement with the mission if the Palestinian Authority did not immediately either fully comply with the Ramallah agreement (which sets out monitoring arrangements) and make substantive improvements to the security of the monitors or come to a new agreement with the Government of Israel. As required by the Ramallah agreement we informed the Israeli authorities that we were delivering a letter in these terms. I have placed a copy of this letter in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="60314-56_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The Palestinian Authority has consistently failed to meet its obligations under the Ramallah agreement. Ultimately the safety of our personnel has to take precedence. It is with regret that I have to inform the <br>&nbsp;<br>

We are supporting the UN High Commission for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs Rapid   Reaction Fund, Oxfam, International Rescue Committee (IRC) and other NGOs to support refugees, displaced persons and their host communities, including those affected by recent violence in eastern DRC. As just one example of what this support provides, the UK&#039;s &#163;683,000 grant to IRC is providing vaccinations against preventable diseases, increased access to water and sanitation and improved food security for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities in South Kivu.
</p>

<a name="60314w01_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>The Secretary of State for International Development this week announced that we would continue to increase our humanitarian support to DRC&#151;up to &#163;30 million in 2006 and the same in 2007. Most of this will go to the UN action plan. The money will be put at the disposal of the humanitarian co-ordinator in DRC who will be able to distribute the funds quickly and flexibly as priority needs dictate. One of the action plan&#039;s main elements is the protection of vulnerable populations, including refugees. It will support emergency health, sanitation and nutritional provision, as well as supporting the safe and dignified return of Congolese refugees from neighbouring countries. It will also help to rebuild the lives of returnees, including the rehabilitation of basic services and provision of basic household goods.
</p>

<a name="60314w01_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>The UK also works at several levels to help put an end to the continuing pockets of conflict in DRC. We are a member of a group of ambassadors and senior UN and EU representatives supporting the transition to democracy in DRC (CIAT&#151;<i>Comit&#233; International d&#039;Accompagnement de la Transition</i>). CIAT has consistently pushed the Congolese transitional government for faster progress in a number of key areas, notably preparations for elections, security sector reform, disarming militias and ending corruption. We are pressing the transitional government to work together to make the democratic process a success, and avoid a return to conflict.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>The presence of foreign armed groups in eastern DRC&#151;such as Rwandan ex-FAR/Interahamwe and various Ugandan groups&#151;is a continuing source of instability. We support the UN&#039;s more robust stance against these groups and have consistently urged the DRC&#039;s neighbours to work constructively in support of the peace process in the DRC. We have also emphasised with the UN and Congolese authorities that all operations against militia groups must take into account the potential impact on the local population.

creating insecurity for local communities. The Secretary of State for International Development visited DRG in October last year and stressed, in discussions with President Kabila and other members of the Government the need to provide properly for DRC&#039;s security forces. He offered &#163;3 million of UK support for accommodation, water and human rights training, but on the condition that the Congolese Government pay and feed their troops first. The UK is providing two members of the EU Security Sector Reform Mission in DRC to assist with the army integration process. The UK and international partners also formally presented a dossier to President Kabila on 23 January this year cataloguing the most serious abuses carried out by FARDC soldiers, urging that the soldiers concerned be brought to justice.

Several hundred protestors were detained, all of whom have now been released. The Egyptians have announced that a full inquiry will take place. We remain in contact with the Government of Egypt and UNHCR on this issue and will continue to monitor the situation.

<p><a name="wa_st_27"></a>
<a name="60314w04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   The focus of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the south is on supporting Sudanese refugees returning from surrounding countries. The UNHCR has agreements or is in discussions with the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia concerning Sudanese refugee repatriation. The UNHCR also provides assistance to movements of internally displaced people within the south and Darfur. The primary agency for north-south returns is the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and Returns, Reintegration and Recovery Unit (RRR).
</p>

<a name="60314w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>The UK is actively involved with all UN agencies on the issue of returning refugees, including through weekly returns co-ordination meetings in Khartoum. We remain concerned about the ability of many areas to absorb and integrate large numbers of returning refugees and have been working with the UN, NGOs and the Government of South Sudan to ensure these issues are addressed. To support this, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the    UN 2006 work plan, from which the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the south.

<p><a name="wa_st_28"></a>
<a name="60314w04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   The Khartoum State is host to approximately 4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) from across Sudan. The IDP population has increased since the 1980s, in both camp and non-camp environments, and presents the Khartoum authorities with significant concerns for urban planning. In March 2004, the Sudanese Government stepped up a process of demolitions and interruption of essential services as a way of moving IDPs to new sites. We have consistently made clear that while we acknowledge the   right of the Sudanese authorities to re-plan their urban environment, the process must be guided by international human rights conventions.
</p>

<a name="60314w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>The UK and international community have been working closely with the Government of Sudan to ensure that their treatment of IDPs is compliant with these conventions. The UK has funded a number of projects in this regard, including providing an expert to work with the Khartoum authorities on settlement and re-planning in Khartoum State. The majority of the interventions in Khartoum State are under the UN&#039;s 2006 work plan for Sudan, to which the UK is contributing &#163;40 million. They will focus on providing essential services for IDPs.

<p><a name="wa_st_29"></a>
<a name="60314w04_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the lead agency responsible for tackling gender-based violence in Darfur and Chad. The UNFPA has been working with the Sudanese Government to allow for the importing of anti-retroviral drugs to help treat rape victims in Darfur. The UK has been closely involved with those working on gender-based violence in Darfur and Khartoum and, through this, has pressed the humanitarian agencies to ensure full, swift and effective treatment of victims of rape in Darfur.

</p>

<a name="60314w04_para2"></a>

Both my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development made clear during their respective visits to the Darfur peace talks in Abuja and Sudan, including Darfur, in February 2006 that the parties must take urgent steps to improve the situation in Darfur and bring those responsible for atrocities to justice.

[HL4300]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_32"></a>
<a name="60314w05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The term &quot;compensation payment&quot; is a general description that covers a wide range of payments that are all different in nature and which may be subject to different tax treatment.
</p>

<a name="60314w05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>For 2003-04 it is estimated that reducing the tax relief limit on redundancy payments from &#163;30,000 to &#163;10,000 would save the Exchequer some &#163;450 million and reducing the limit to &#163;20,000 would save the Exchequer some &#163;150 million. The average redundancy payment received in 2003&#150;04 is estimated to be around &#163;12,500 per person.

<p><a name="wa_st_35"></a>
<a name="60314w05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Gifts in consideration of marriage which are fully exempt because they do not exceed the prescribed limits are not reported to HIVRC. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of this relief.
</p>

<a name="60314w05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_39"></a>The total cost is likely to be small for the following reasons:
