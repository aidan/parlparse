<H4><center>Wednesday, 13th March 2002.</center></H4>
<H4><center>The House met at half-past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prayers&#151;Read by the Lord Bishop of Bristol. </center></H4>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Razzall </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the switchover from analogue to digital television can be achieved within their proposed timetable.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, the Government are committed to ensuring that terrestrial analogue broadcasting signals are maintained until everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels can receive them in digital form and switching to digital is an affordable option. We believe that these criteria, although challenging, can be achieved and that switchover can take place within the timeframe of 2006-10.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Does she accept that the current take-up of digital television has been almost entirely among subscribers to pay television and not those wanting access to free-to-view television? Does she further accept that it is unlikely that more than 60 per cent of the population will ever take up pay television subscriptions and that before analogue can be switched off there must be a significant increase in the take-up of digital free-to-view television services? Does the Minister consider that that is highly unlikely to happen by 2010 in view of the existing constraints on digital terrestrial television and the limited free-to-view services available, not helped, of course, by Tessa Jowell's decision yesterday?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I accept that at present the numbers of people buying sets with integrated digital facilities are quite small. However, I understand that cheap set-top boxes will be available in the shops before Easter. They are expected to cost less than &#163;100. That will lead to a substantial increase in the numbers of people able to go digital. It is extremely hard to anticipate what will happen by 2010. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is being a little pessimistic about the likely take-up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, as the owner of one of the cheap boxes described by the Minister&#151;and I must say how greatly my picture has improved&#151;I understand that BBC 4 is now available <P>


<a name="column_818"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 818</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a free service. However, it is not easy to locate. Why is not more publicity given about how one can receive that free service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware that there was a problem in locating the new BBC 4 service. I shall certainly take up the issue. I understand that a lot of information has been provided about how it can be obtained. I shall check with the BBC whether that is the case and, if not, how the situation can be improved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that Ceefax services have been withdrawn from the digital service provided by the BBC through subscription television? That hardly helps the case for switching from analogue to digital television because the text service provided is very much inferior to Ceefax. Viewers are constantly referred to Ceefax numbers&#151;where one can look up addresses and obtain information about programmes which are to be transmitted&#151;but that facility is not available on the digital service. The BBC should be asked why it has done this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am very interested to hear what my noble friend says. Again, it is not a matter of which I was aware. I shall be very happy to make sure that this issue also is taken up with the BBC. It is vital that viewers and potential viewers have all the information that they need to make choices.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, have the Government estimated the value of the re-engineered analogue channels? If so&#151;and I cannot believe that they have not made some estimate&#151;would that not justify the provision of financial incentives to viewers to ease the transition to digital?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it is far too early to talk about subsidising individual viewers to shift to digital. This is an area where the market should be allowed to work. As I said, there will be opportunities in the near future for people to obtain digital boxes at relatively low prices. I suspect that the take-up will be very large. We should be optimistic rather than pessimistic about the likely take-up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that what you do&#151;at least in my case&#151;is switch on the television set, click on the relevant BBC 4 button&#151;and finish up with the most indescribably boring programme you have ever watched in your life? You then wish that it was a good deal harder to get the programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has strong views about many issues, including television programmes. All I can say to him is that if he does not like it he can switch over to another <P>


<a name="column_819"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 819</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>channel. If he has digital facilities he will have a large number of channels available from which to plan an alternative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are keen for us to have access to channels such as BBC 4 from 2006, would they consider the pragmatic step of doing the switchover on a rolling out basis&#151;possibly on a transmitter, regional or channel by channel basis&#151;just to make sure that we do not all find ourselves without access to television on switchover day?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness raises an interesting issue on how the transmission can be managed. It is a point that the Government may want to consider when the time comes. Again, it is a little early to anticipate exactly the best way of managing the transition, but that is certainly a matter we shall want to take into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister share the view of the chairman of the BBC that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, being a privileged member of the middle classes, should not have asked the question he asked?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend would be extremely put out if I suggested that he could not ask any question that he wanted to ask in this House, so long as it was put in an amusing and courteous way, as is his wont. Of course, we need to take into account the views of all potential viewers, whatever their social background, their region and their particular interest.


<a name="20313-01_head1"></a><H3><center>London Underground</center></H3>
<P>

<a name="20313-01_time0"></a><H5>2.44 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Ezra </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>In what circumstances the capital invested in the London Underground under the public private partnership scheme would count as public expenditure.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the PPP saves &#163;2 billion of public money over the first 15 years of the contracts, in comparison to funding the same projects through conventional public investment. The plans will mean &#163;16 billion of investment over the next 15 years.
<P>

<a name="20313-01_para0"></a>In accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, capital invested in London Underground under the PPP would count as public expenditure if London Underground Ltd's accountants and auditors judged that the assets should be on London Underground's balance sheet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that the Government have issued a letter of comfort <P>


<a name="column_820"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the funds that will be borrowed by the infrastructure companies from the banks? In that event, would this count as part of the public sector borrowing requirement, or would it count as part of the balance sheet of Transport for London? In either event, would it not mean that the whole of the risk for investment in the Underground would be borne ultimately by the public sector, thus negating what we thought was one of the objectives of the PPP?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, those are two slightly different questions. On the point about the letter of comfort, yes, it is true that a letter of comfort has been issued, underwriting 95 per cent of the third party debt, which is not the same as shareholder funds. London Underground Ltd is a public corporation. Therefore, what is on its balance sheet affects the public sector net borrowing, which does not have any effect on the targets under our fiscal rules. On the noble Lord's final point, it really does not make any difference to the benefits of the PPP as we see them. That depends on the saving of &#163;2 billion of public money. That applies whether the capital invested is off balance sheet or on balance sheet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether it is too late for the noble Lord to seek to persuade the Secretary of State for Transport&#151;who is somewhat prone to error&#151;to resile from yet another serious mistake in introducing the PPP. Will the noble Lord point out to him that the recent report from Ernst & Young on this matter seems to me to be one of the most Delphic communications ever to emerge from a firm of consultants?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020313/text/20313-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have listened carefully to the exchanges in this Chamber on the issue of the Ernst & Young report. I have listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, has said previously, and to what my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer has said in reply. It has nothing whatever to do with "on balance sheet" or "off balance sheet". Nevertheless, I thought that my noble and learned friend gave rather effective replies to the questions raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, does not the Question reflect the growing concern that the dangerous practice that has been revealed recently in the private sector of hiding a build-up of debt off the balance sheet might now creep into the public accounts via the public/private partnerships? Is not full disclosure the answer? Will the Government publish an analysis of the full amount of public liability that is, or may be, involved in all the existing public/private partnerships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is in danger of drawing a false analogy between what is happening here and what happened, for example, with Enron, where, indeed, funds&#151;or lack of funds&#151;were kept off the balance sheet. The issue here is one for London Underground's auditors. They have to decide whether the amounts of money involved in <P>


<a name="column_821"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 821</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the public/private partnership make a change to London Underground's assets as a whole. By "London Underground's assets as a whole" I do not mean merely the book value of the assets&#151;which exclude all the written-down assets over more than 100 years&#151;but the total assets. That is the consideration that will influence the auditors in making a decision as to whether the amounts are off balance sheet or on balance sheet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord give the House an undertaking that he will deal with these matters in greater and more pertinent detail, in relation to the Statement which I understand is to be made later?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, no; the Statement which will be made this afternoon is not even remotely on this subject. It is about audit and accountancy in the public sector. The Statement is about the Sharman report, which is not about London Underground. It would take some ingenuity to get me to respond later this afternoon to these matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Blackwell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that, wherever this particular expenditure is scored, the real test of whether it is effective to replace public with private funding is, first, whether there is transfer of risk from the public sector to the private sector; and, secondly, whether it achieves the introduction of effective private-sector management disciplines? Would he be prepared for the PPP, in this case, to be judged on those two criteria?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, yes; I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   My Lords, would it have been cheaper or more expensive to finance the London Underground capital investment through Ken Livingstone's bond option rather than through the PPP?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the answer is no&#151;partly for the reason just given by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, with which I have just agreed. As he rightly said, the issue in this case is the transfer of risk. Although that could be done by issuing bonds, and the price of bonds would be lower than the rate of return on capital that the private partners will expect, the private partners will be taking very significant risks in return for that rate of return. When such risk has been taken by the public sector&#151;as, for example, in the extension to the Jubilee Line or the improvements to the Central Line&#151;it has been shown to be very poor value for money for taxpayers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I should already understand this&#151;I am sure that I should&#151;but, given that the noble Lord is telling us that sometimes these enormous figures will be on the <P>


<a name="column_822"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 822</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>balance sheet and sometimes they will not, according to what the accountants say, how will the public know what their total debt is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the figures will not be sometimes on and sometimes off the balance sheet. At some stage soon after 10th April, when it is expected that the agreement between the private partners and London Underground will be signed, KPMG, London Underground's accountants, will make a decision on the whole of the amount. It will either be on or off. It will not be partly on and partly off.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, without discussing the balance sheet, can the noble Lord say whether giving letters of comfort exposes the Government to the risk and liability of ultimately having to meet the balance that they have guaranteed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as I made clear in an earlier answer, the letters of comfort are confined to third-party debt. Public discussion on these matters tends to make the wrong assumption&#151;that they relate to shareholder funds.

<P>
<UL>What impact anti-smoking initiatives are having on the numbers of people giving up smoking and taking up smoking.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, in the first six months of 2001-02, about 104,800 people set a quit date using the NHS smoking cessation services, and 53,500 had successfully given up at the four-week follow-up stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging reply. As today is National No Smoking Day, will he join me in congratulating all those noble Lords who in the past year have given up smoking&#151;or indeed not started smoking? Will he also tell us what investigations NICE has conducted into the cost effectiveness of the anti-smoking strategies and how those strategies compare with strategies to combat other substance misuse?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to congratulate all noble Lords who have given up smoking in the past year. I stopped smoking on 28th July, and I am still going strong at the moment&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew15"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, both Zyban and nicotine replacement therapy have been referred <P>


<a name="column_823"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 823</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to NICE, and my understanding is that it will soon reach a conclusion. Unless an appeal is made against its final appraisal determination, that advice will, we hope, be issued very shortly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   My Lords, in congratulating the noble Lord on giving up smoking successfully, may I ask him whether he believes that the Government's anti-smoking initiatives are sufficiently robust and shocking to have an impact on the many teenage girls who take up smoking round about the ages of 13 and 14?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right to suggest that teenage smoking, particularly among young girls, is a matter of concern. The Government have a strategy designed to focus particularly on teenage smokers which I believe is effective.
<P>

<a name="20313-02_para0"></a>As for the substantive point, on the actual messages given out, I draw the noble Lord's attention to the Smokescreen Youth Initiative, launched last autumn, in which young people themselves produced a set of films that have been shown on television and will soon, we hope, be shown in cinemas. The films are very hard hitting and entail young people talking to young people, and I think that they will be very effective in getting the message over.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's action in increasing tobacco duties has led to increased incentives for illegal smuggling and illegal distribution? Does he also agree that that has worked against the other government measures designed to reduce smoking, particularly by increasing the availability of cigarettes to young people?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that one should underestimate the impact of fiscal policy on smoking habits. As a general point, research has consistently shown that demand for cigarettes is undoubtedly affected by their price. However, the smuggling of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco is a matter of concern to the Government, and we are dealing with it through a tobacco-smuggling strategy. The indications are that Customs and Excise has had some very big successes in the first year of that strategy and has hit its key target of holding the market share of smuggled cigarettes. It has seized 2.8 billion cigarettes and broken up 56 major excise smuggling gangs.
<P>

<a name="20313-02_para1"></a>I should add that European Union countries which may have lower duty levels also face smuggling issues. I therefore believe that it is right to have a fiscal policy of discouraging smoking alongside vigorous policies to reduce smuggling.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-02_spnew21"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, as one who is approaching the second anniversary of having given up, may I express my huge relief at no longer being a slave to that horrible weed? May I also say how much <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we seem to be taking on the character of a revivalist meeting. However, I know that the matter of EU subsidies causes concern both to noble Lords and to the Government. We have taken up the matter a number of times with the European Union, and we shall continue to press the matter very vigorously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, as one who has not smoked since the age of 13, may I ask my noble friend whether the Government are any closer to implementing an approved code of practice on passive smoking at work, as recommended by the Health and Safety Commission rather more than two years ago? Has he been following developments in the Irish Republic, where the Irish Government are giving active consideration to banning smoking completely in pubs?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the Government do not seek to go down the route of banning smoking in pubs. We have, however, encouraged the development of a partnership with the hospitality industry which will ensure that non-smokers are protected and that there is a choice of places to eat and drink so that they will not be bothered by other people's smoke. I think that a voluntary approach is desirable.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para0"></a> My noble friend will know that the Government are giving careful consideration to the Health and Safety Commission's proposals in the approved code of practice on smoking in the workplace. As part of that process, the commission has been asked to consider the implications of the code of practice for the hospitality sector and small businesses generally.

<P>

<A NAME="20313-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, what is the most important step that the Government could take to reduce deaths from smoking?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we continue to press on with our anti-smoking strategy of which the development of smoking cessation services is an important part. We cannot be complacent, but there are encouraging signs on which we need to build.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that prohibition in the United States did not stamp out drinking and, if anything, encouraged it? It became smart to go underground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the two matters can be pooled together in the same category. First, smoking is harmful under <P>


<a name="column_825"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 825</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any circumstances. I believe that a different situation exists in regard to alcohol, particularly for sensible drinkers. Secondly, it is not the Government's intention to make smoking illegal. We seek to ensure that in public places non-smokers, as far as possible, are not subject to passive smoking and we seek to develop programmes to help those who want to give up smoking to do so as effectively as possible.

A separate meeting with members of the Railtrack Private Shareholders Group also took place on 20th November 2001.

<A NAME="20313-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer, in view of the wide range of subjects with which he deals. Has he seen the letter in The Times of 6th March written by investment managers? Usually they are highly respected members of the community&#151;some of them are probably middle class, although their investment advice is not always correct. I am not now talking about Railtrack, but about a point that was made in that letter that they believed&#151;not "thought"&#151;that there was a regulation that made sure that downside risk was limited. Does the Government believe that to be true? If it is, can my noble friend tell the House which other privatised companies have their downside risk limited by regulation? If he would care to let me have the names of the companies&#151;I declare an interest&#151;I would be happy to consider investing in them.

It referred to a range of matters, including privatised companies with a downside risk regulated. I do not know of any other. I cannot draw the attention of the noble Lord to them. An article in the Financial Times commented on that letter, saying that a number of other people, including Tim Stone, chairman of corporate finance at KPMG, said that the issues raised in that letter had no effect on PFI generally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of no such letter. It is worth reminding the House of the first point of the April 2001 statement of principle between the Government and Railtrack, which clearly stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government stands behind the rail system but not behind individual rail companies and their shareholders who need to be fully aware of the projected liabilities of the companies in which they invest and the performance risks they face".

That statement was made in April 2001.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as an investment fund manager. Does the Minister agree that, due to Railtrack receivership, the relationship of trust between investment fund managers and the Government has broken down, so making it more difficult for them to support, with confidence, future railway expenditure without firm government guarantees?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not believe that the relationship of trust has broken down. I shall quote what David Metter, the chief executive of Innisfree, one of the largest PFI equity investors, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "We have absolutely no concern that the Government will not honour its obligations under PPPs and PFIs".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="20313-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the reality is that no major passenger railway system in the world has ever broken even, let alone made a true profit; that every government have found themselves subsidising our passenger railway system; and that any private bidder will assume that on the basis of all history the Government will pick up the tab because it has no realistic alternative? It was a mistake to privatise British Rail, but having done so would it not be sensible to recognise the reality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the basic proposition. I cannot say that every single passenger rail system, but the vast majority, require a public subsidy. That has always been known. It was known in relation to Railtrack, but that is not the same as saying that the Government were providing a guarantee that they would always provide to that particular vehicle whatever it asked for, irrespective of the quality of its management and irrespective of the quality of its asset management.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, to answer what has happened to free-market capitalism would require a wide-ranging reply. The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, is probably the man to ask.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth </B>   rose to call attention to the case for raising public awareness of the work of Parliament; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the institution of Parliament is fundamental to our political system. It is the vital link between citizen and government. People speak to government through Parliament. It is the authoritative public body for calling government to account. A healthy Parliament is central to the well being of the political system and central to the health of Parliament is public awareness of, and support for, the work that it does. A Parliament that is starved of public support is an isolated and, ultimately, vulnerable institution. In short, Parliament and the public need one another and each ideally needs to recognise the importance of the other. That recognition, I suggest, is lacking. There is declining public interest in what Parliament does and a failure on the part of Parliament to develop links with citizens.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para4"></a>Let me identify what I believe to be the causes of this poor relationship. They are several and are not confined to Parliament. I suggest that the problems are <P>


<a name="column_828"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 828</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>structural, attitudinal, behavioural, and societal. By structures, I refer to parliamentary structures. The two Houses are not structured, or rather are not as well structured as they could be, to facilitate public awareness of what goes on within Parliament. Much of the present debate about parliamentary reform focuses on the relationship between Parliament and the executive. That is of fundamental importance and I very much welcome the debate that is taking place. However, what tends to be neglected is the relationship between citizen and Parliament and, indeed, between Parliament and citizen. Although there is greater transparency in parliamentary proceedings than previously was the case, both Houses tend to stick with structures, as well as procedures and practices, that are not geared to encouraging public interest in, and access to, the work of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para5"></a>By attitudes, I refer especially to the attitudes taken towards Parliament by government and the media. If government and the media take the attitude that Parliament is somehow peripheral, a body not to be taken seriously, then it is not surprising that citizens generally are not inclined to take much interest in Parliament. A dismissive attitude toward Parliament is not new but it is becoming more pronounced.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para6"></a>Successive Speakers have had to remind Ministers in another place that statements of new policy should be made first to Parliament and not to a press conference. Media interest is limited. The press galleries for most of the time resemble the "Marie Celeste". What coverage there is has shown a qualitative change. The sketch-writer has taken over from the parliamentary reporter. Television coverage has diminished since the cameras were first admitted. Coverage of the committee work of Parliament in particular attracts far less attention than it did a decade ago.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para7"></a> However, parliamentarians cannot be absolved from responsibility. Some Members do not always take Parliament seriously as a body for effectively scrutinising government. There is an inherent tension in the position of most MPs, being elected to support the party in government yet being Members of a body that is expected to subject to critical scrutiny that very same government. If the balance tips too far in favour of the government, then it is hardly surprising if the public take little interest in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para8"></a>There is, in addition, a tendency on the part of some Members to be somewhat wary of the media. We criticise the media for not giving Parliament the attention that we believe it deserves, yet we tend to ignore how we might ensure that what we do is more attractive and more accessible to the media. We are too prone to make a virtue of economy at the expense of effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para9"></a>Both Houses devote relatively few resources to public relations, to ensuring that what we do is promoted to the media and other bodies outside the House. Your Lordships' House has taken the lead in appointing an information officer. She does an excellent job. The other place has now followed suit. However, the resources we commit to public relations are minuscule compared to other parliaments. Indeed, <P>


<a name="column_829"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 829</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Scottish Parliament has more than three times the number of staff that this House has with responsibility for public relations.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para10"></a>By behaviour, I refer to the conduct of politicians. There is a problem at a collective as well as an individual level. The clash of beliefs represented by the political parties is healthy, indeed fundamental to our political system, but if the clash degenerates into mindless point scoring then it repels electors. Partisanship in the other House is a product of excessive party loyalty: MPs recognise that it does the reputation of the House no good but are unable to stop their party instincts from driving their behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para11"></a>At the individual level, if Ministers and parliamentarians behave in a way that falls below the standards expected of them by citizens, then their behaviour undermines popular support for and, consequently, interest in Parliament. Although we now have codes of conduct, a Parliamentary Commissioner in another place, and the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the public perception of the conduct of politicians remains a negative one. The perception is that politicians cannot be trusted to tell the truth and that they are out to further their own ends. That was made all too clear in the first report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and it continues to be borne out by survey data.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para12"></a> Finally, and most important of all, there are changes in society itself. We have seen some significant shifts in the stance taken by citizens towards political institutions. In recent decades, according to some commentators, there had been a decline in the civic culture. Samuel Beer, the distinguished American political scientist, has argued that deference in Britain has given way to a new populism. Party leaders seek to tap that populism, to some extent directly. What has been termed "designer populism" has been a feature of the growth of presidentialism in British politics&#151;the Prime Minister becoming detached from his own government as well as from party and Parliament and intervening in public policy as the champion of the people to address a particular problem. That development, as is implicit in what I have said, has been at the expense of parties and Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para13"></a>Not only has there been a more populist approach, but there has also been a change in participation. There has been a decline in support for political parties. People have found outlets for their political views through pressure groups&#151;in some cases through direct action groups. Others have simply turned away from politics. Other attractions now absorb their energies.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para14"></a>A consequence of these developments is that there is limited and decreasing public interest in Parliament. People do not see Parliament as particularly relevant to their lives. It appears peripheral. That is reinforced by constitutional change, with powers passing to other bodies&#151;the European Union, the courts and now elected assemblies in different parts of the United Kingdom. If there is an interest in political activity, then it is directed elsewhere.
<P>


<a name="column_830"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 830</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para15"></a>We thus face a dilemma. Parliament is crucial to the health of the political system. It needs the support and interest of the people if it is to be a strong institution in fulfilling the tasks expected of it. That support and interest, on the whole, are not there. Parliament by itself cannot restore faith in political activity. We need to go wider than Parliament in order to achieve that. But it can go some way towards addressing the problem. It needs to adopt a more robust stance towards government, and especially towards the conduct of Ministers. It also, and crucially, needs to increase public awareness of what it is doing. That is a prerequisite for bolstering public support, although support will not necessarily flow from greater awareness. Parliament has to prove itself.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para16"></a>I turn to what needs to be done. We need to take a new approach to the media and, indeed, to citizens. The relationship between Parliament and citizen is, as I have argued, two way. We need to provide greater access for citizens to Parliament. We need to ensure that Parliament reaches out more to citizens. Furthermore, what people see, and what we tell people we are doing, has to be relevant.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para17"></a>What can we do to increase greater access? Interest groups send us a lot of material and constituents write to their MPs on an ever-increasing scale. But none of that gives us a clear view of what people think. We need to provide more structured means of ensuring that citizens have some input and are heard. One possibility is to make greater use of the Internet for on-line consultation. The Hansard Society&#151;and I declare an interest as a member of the society's council&#151;has already undertaken some on-line discussions for committees, including the Science and Technology Select Committee of this House. There are some problems associated with using the Internet for consultation, as the Commons Public Administration Select Committee has noted, but such techniques can help complement other means of contact.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para18"></a>Another important change would be to create, in another place, a petitions committee. Many citizens devote a great deal of time and effort to persuading people to sign petitions. Some petitions have many thousands of signatures. But the petitions go into a parliamentary black hole. Petitions committees, able to receive petitions, investigate them or pass them on to other committees, are features of many west European legislatures. The Scottish Parliament has one. The House of Commons used to have one. There is a powerful case for creating a new one.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para19"></a>The proposal for a petitions committee was advanced by the Conservative Party's Commission to Strengthen Parliament, which I had the honour to chair. Another proposal of the Commission was that your Lordships' House should regularly refer Bills to Select Committees before the usual Committee stage of a Bill. That would permit bodies outside Parliament to have some input into the legislative process and to do so in a highly transparent manner. A similar argument applies to the use of special standing committees in the other place.
<P>


<a name="column_831"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 831</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para20"></a>I take these as examples of the kind of thing that we should be doing. What, then, of reaching out to citizens? I welcome the fact that the Parliament website has been re-designed and will soon come on-line, albeit far too late. I welcome the experiment with webcasting of parliamentary committees. But we must go further. As the modernisation committee in another place noted in its recent report,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"committee reports now look like documents from a previous era".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-03_para21"></a>
We need professionally designed documents. But that is just the beginning. We need a fundamental change of attitude towards the media and towards the dissemination of reports and information about what we do. We need more staff to promote our work to the media and to the wider public. Despite recent additions, we are grossly under-resourced. We need to push out material to anyone we think is interested in it. We should be disseminating reports, even Hansard, to groups, societies and any organisation with an interest in public policy. We need to bring the media in. Rather than politicians trooping over to 4 Millbank, we should be bringing 4 Millbank into the Palace of Westminster. We need to provide more space and facilities for the media. We need to make the Palace media-friendly. That involves a change of attitude and more resources. It also involves ensuring that what we do is relevant.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para22"></a>If citizens are to take an interest in what we do, we have to ensure not only that they see what we are doing but that what we do resonates with their interests and concerns. Here there is a problem, especially with the other place. Your Lordships' House does a good job in carrying out its functions. We could do better and we must ensure that what we do is better known and that there is greater input from people outside.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para23"></a> With the House of Commons, there is a more fundamental problem. Often, the issues that concern people outside are those that are discussed on free votes. Such occasions are rare and are generally squeezed out by the predictable debate that takes place between the parties. As a consequence, the House of Commons does not appear dreadfully relevant to the citizens who elected it. There needs to be reform of practices and procedures but also new thinking about the issues that Parliament discusses. The Commons Liaison Committee has recommended short debates on Select Committee reports, which I very much welcome. But what about short debates on grievances raised by petitions? That would be one way of re-connecting with the people.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para24"></a>I offer those as illustrations of what we should be thinking about and doing. The list is far from exhaustive. I hope that your Lordships will add to it during this debate. But I hope that I have shown the need for much more innovative thought about how Parliament connects with citizens. Some of my proposals may appear radical. My purpose in focusing on the wider context is to show that, relative to the problems we face, far from being radical, these are <P>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 832</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely modest proposals&#151;modest, my Lords, and essential to the health of our parliamentary democracy. I beg to move for Papers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, we are indeed grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, for initiating this important debate. He made the case for Parliament. In all my years in the other place and in my brief time in this House, I never thought that I should ever have to rise to make the case for Parliament. That was almost inbred in us&#151;part of our background and part of our history. We should not need to make that case. The sadness is that we need to do just that. That is a shameful situation.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para25"></a>Parliament must prove itself and, more importantly, Members of Parliament must prove themselves and assert themselves rather more. In the past few years, they have not done that and have been considered almost as part of the executive machinery, supporting the executive rather than questioning them and bringing them properly to account by asking them real questions. They should have been saying, "I am here to represent the people who sent me here, not to represent only my party. My party is important, but even more important than my party are my principles and this country". That should be the motivating force behind them all. Unfortunately, we have not seen that.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para26"></a> Let us get one thing out of the way at the outset: the standards of the conduct of Members of Parliament. I was the chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee of the House of Commons. Of course there were one or two unpleasant cases, but they were a very small minority. If we consider the country as a whole, I would say that my colleagues on both sides of the House of Commons and on all sides of this House are honourable and decent men&#151;men and women of much higher standards of probity and conduct than one would find in the population at large. So that is not the cause of the problems that we face. Naturally, it is a matter that we must deal with, but it has nothing to do with the decline of Parliament. Let us get that quite clear at the outset.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para27"></a>In fact, during the past few years we have seen the rapid decline in the reporting of Parliament. Part of that was due to the large government majority; part to a much greater consensus on a number of matters which made for fewer policy differences between the parties. Speeches in the House of Commons used to reflect strongly independent, personal views that made for comment in the newspapers and the media generally. However, speeches seemed no longer to have that force. Members of Parliament would say in private what they did not say on the Floor of the House. In the past, more of them were prepared to speak their mind even where they disagreed with their own party. So it was left to the parliamentary commentators in the press to interpret what they saw as the mood of Parliament, rather than the speeches in Parliament, which should have shown the greater division in reality as Members of Parliament saw it.
<P>


<a name="column_833"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 833</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para28"></a>That allowed the sketch writers to whom the noble Lord, Lord Norton, referred greater opportunity to provide their own amusement amid their interpretation. Because it did not fully represent the views of dissenters on the Government Benches, and because the Opposition were reduced and demoralised, Parliament became more of a ritual of tit-for-tat as antagonistic views were thrown across the House of Commons. The House of Lords was much better in that respect, but as the House of Commons is the primary Chamber for commentators, the standing of Parliament was represented by what took place there.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para29"></a>Dissent by their own Back-Benchers is always inconvenient to government. We all know that. But such inconvenience did not prevent previous generations of Back-Benchers expressing their views openly and frequently&#151;with courtesy, of course&#151;as was the obligation of each Member of Parliament. In that respect, the role of the government Back-Bencher is crucial. It is that person who, speaking to others, can apply the pressure to alter policy. With such a large majority as we now have, that pressure is much reduced. Francis Pym, now the noble Lord, Lord Pym, had it quite right when in 1983 he pointed out the need for a modest majority. In such circumstances, Parliament can operate nearer to what the standard works on our constitution predict. It is in this situation that government can be held to account by their Back-Benchers when their voices and, occasionally, their votes cannot be overlooked. For that correct and honourable assessment, the noble Lord, Lord Pym, was sacked. That was sad.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para30"></a>Perhaps I may set out my personal position. As a member of the government party, like most other members, I have always believed that where I had no decided view opposing that of the Government, my responsibility was to support them. In the 1960s, I was chairman of a Back-Bench economic and finance committee, as was my noble friend Lord Barnett. I disagreed with the Government on two matters that the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, put at the top of his political agenda. Those were the devaluation of the pound sterling, of which I was in favour, and the need as I saw it to withdraw our troops from East of Suez. The first subject, devaluation, was unmentionable; the second was also opposed by Harold Wilson who, in one memorable speech, said that our frontier was on the Himalayas.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para31"></a>My views, unorthodox at the time, aroused considerable interest. I set them out in Parliament. Parliament should not be an optional medium for setting out one's views; for a Member of Parliament, it should be the main one. So it was with Churchill, so it was with Lloyd George, so it was with Gladstone&#151;so it was with all those great people of the past. We are only pale shadows of them, but in at least one respect, we should be able to do what they did and speak what we feel in this place. That is what we are here for.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para32"></a>Of course one supports government&#151;frequently after argument, discussion and dissent&#151;but one comes to one's own conclusions and one should express them here. That is what this place is about. <P>


<a name="column_834"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 834</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, the other place has not been about that for some time. That is a great shame. People write their columns in the press, they give interviews of one kind or another, but if they have a view and want to express it, this is the place to do so. This is the heart of democracy. Unless we understand that and act on it, we are not doing anything about it.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para33"></a>An effective opposition sitting across the House of Commons Chamber is essential to the proper functioning of Parliament. Dissent on the government Benches&#151;not opposition&#151;is inconvenient but is essential for Parliament. Such are the aspects of Parliament that make it the centre of political ideas and action. The situation today may be much easier. The Opposition may be settling down now, after a long time, for the long haul. Many Labour Members who feared that they might be one-term MPs are beginning to use their position to assert themselves. Parliament as a whole may now be well on the road to re-asserting itself. If that proves to be the case, the press and the media generally may become more interested in the day-to-day work of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para34"></a>A further cause for the lack of interest in Parliament is the increasing power of special advisers and the growing disillusionment with their role. As my noble friend Lord Hattersley reminded the House on Monday, the special advisers whom he used to know were different. They owed much of their legitimacy to the Fulton committee on the Civil Service. That committee, on which I served, agreed that there was a role for special advisers who were expert in their field but had political allegiances. That enabled them to fit in with the Civil Service and with the views and aspirations of the Minister whom they served. Such were Nikki Kaldor and Tommy Balogh. Another was Jack Straw, whose salary I happen to have confirmed while I was a Minister in the Civil Service Department.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para35"></a>Such people caused no problems. They were not grit in the machine; they were an asset to the Civil Service and to the Government. They were experts without executive power and acted as an expert link between the Minister and the higher Civil Service. They were valued in Whitehall, and there would have been no difficulty getting them to appear before Select Committees. Advisers now are rather more than the name suggests and are not even permitted to be questioned by the relevant Select Committees about their role and operations. If they are there, what are they doing? If we have to ask what they are doing, who should be asking that question? The relevant Select Committee should ask it, but Select Committees are not allowed to see them. They are not allowed to call them before them. Such people are taking on a role beyond that of special adviser; they are almost political appointees, in some senses.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para36"></a>The Select Committees need to examine the role and operation of such advisers. Some of them, without question, are very good, but why should they not be questioned? Why should we not know what they do, day by day, whom they see and how they handle themselves? The consequence of all that is increasing cynicism and lack of concern about the work of Parliament. I see that there is expected to be a new <P>


<a name="column_835"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Civil Service Act in the next Session of Parliament. I hope that that will be confirmed by my noble and learned friend the Minister. It would be a valuable contribution, and the House could add quite a bit to it.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para37"></a>There is one important change that must be made. The Committee Office of the House has done much to promote public understanding of the activities of committees. In the other place, when I was chairman of the Liaison Committee, minutes of evidence were available fairly promptly. I argued for them to be made available overnight on the Internet. That made it possible for such information to form part of the following day's political news, so people could see what was going on, even if they were not present. If there was a matter of concern or interest to someone, they would be able to find out something about it.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para38"></a> The Liaison Committee went further and argued for uncorrected evidence to be made available overnight, with the proviso that it be clearly labelled on each page that it was uncorrected. Corrected evidence could, of course, be published later. The delay in publication allowed witnesses to correct any mistakes that they may have made in giving evidence. The evidence was available to journalists present, but was only partial. We argued that it should be complete. It was eventually agreed that the new arrangements should apply to Ministers, with further discussions to be held on extending the arrangements. As far as I know, the argument continues.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para39"></a>The position in your Lordships' House is that even corrected evidence is not available. For example, there have been no minutes on the Internet of the Economic Affairs Committee since last July. I have kindly been given draft minutes because of my interest, but such information should be freely available. I had some difficulty in achieving the widespread dissemination of minutes of evidence in the other place. I hope that I will not have long to wait for it here.

<A NAME="20313-03_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, for introducing the debate and for the powerful speech that he made. It will repay much careful study. It was densely packed with insight and suggestions. He was right to pay tribute to the parliamentary information services. They do a good job on a small budget. I imagine that it is common ground among your Lordships that a great deal more must be done. It is to that that I shall address myself.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para40"></a>As chairman of the Hansard Society&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, referred&#151;I speak with particular conviction that more must be done. Over the years the Hansard Society has done much to try to bridge the growing gap about which we have heard between Parliament and the public. We are now poised to take a step up in our activity, in partnership with the Citizenship Foundation&#151;I am glad to see my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury, the president of the Citizenship Foundation, in his place&#151;and the Electoral Commission. Our activity is designed to <P>


<a name="column_836"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increase understanding of and respect for Parliament, especially among young people. Most of what I have to say will, indeed, be about young people.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para41"></a>Sadly, it is not the case that young people in this country respect and understand Parliament. Yet it is imperative for our democratic health that those people&#151;the next generation&#151;grow up with a good grasp of what Parliament does, how it does it and why it does it. In that respect, one need only compare this country with countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the United States. There, whatever the defects of the political system, no child grows up without a healthy and well developed respect for the constitution and the Bundestag or the United States Congress. Such respect does not exist today among our young people. In fact, the reverse is true. We see the negative and reverse image of that respect and understanding&#151;ignorance and alienation.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para42"></a>MORI research carried out recently for the Hansard Society showed that there was a perception among 18 year-olds that Parliament is incomprehensible and irrelevant. As we know, turnout among first-time voters hit an all-time low at the last election. There is a massive job to be done. The citizenship curriculum, which I welcome&#151;I think that it is one of the Government's most constructive educational innovations&#151;gives us an opportunity to do that job. However, I would like an assurance from the Minister, when he responds to the debate, that, in a citizenship curriculum crowded with all sorts of worthy issues, the key issue of understanding Parliament will be a fundamental building block.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para43"></a>The aim of the Hansard Society-led consortium to which I have just referred is to give every student, during his or her school career, a taste of Parliament. We want to work with schools to take Parliament to students and bring them to Parliament. We want to do that virtually, creating a virtual Parliament on the web, and physically. We must connect better with young people.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para44"></a>Of course, when we say that they are ignorant of Parliament, we do not mean that they are not interested in issues. They are intensely interested in issues, but they do not see the connection between this House, the other place and our procedures, and the issues that interest them. Many issues interest young people, among which are public policy issues and the environment, including conservation issues. Student grants have been a controversial subject in Parliament. Young people are interested in issues such as&#151;if I dare to say it from these Benches&#151;the decriminalisation of cannabis. All those matters have particular salience for young people today, but they do not see Parliament as the place in which they are dealt with; nor do they know how they are dealt with. They do not see the connection between their interest in issues and the way in which they are dealt with in the public sphere.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para45"></a>As I listen to young people being conducted around this place by our admirable staff and others, I have to say that very often the lens through which they are invited to see Parliament is a historical one. They are invited to view this great institution as though it were <P>


<a name="column_837"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a historic monument or house, with wonderful history attached. That is important but it is as nothing compared to our working institution which is designed to protect, guard and advance the interests of the public.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para46"></a>We need a feasibility study on whether there should be a large visitor centre to increase the carrying capacity of this House which, at present, is scarce. Your Lordships cannot abuse the carrying capacity of this House if we are to do our job, but such a centre would give people a chance to understand what they were about to see before they came into the Houses of Parliament. We need to examine that proposal very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para47"></a> I should like to move on to the issue of the media&#151;always a popular dog to kick in your Lordships' House&#151;and in particular to the role of television. We shall shortly discuss the communications Bill&#151;although it seems to be indefinitely postponed&#151;and in that Bill the issue of public service broadcasting will loom large. Only in Britain would we spend hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money through the licence fee to secure the vital good of the public interest and not be prepared to define exactly what that interest is and how it is to be safeguarded by the broadcasters. If public service does not include communicating the role, activities and value of our national democratic institutions, what else can it possibly include? That must be fundamental to any definition of public service broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para48"></a>Today, the coverage of Parliament is wholly inadequate, not only by the BBC but by other terrestrial broadcasters who have public service obligations. I know that many of the talented and well-motivated people who work in news and current affairs would agree with my criticism. The problem is that parliamentary coverage is confused with political coverage. We all understand very well how they relate to each other, but it sometimes seems that some of the pier-end entertainment managers who appear to have taken over the direction of British television think that there is no difference between parliamentary coverage and political coverage.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para49"></a>They can just about get their minds around adversarial politics because that is good knockabout stuff. They quite enjoy elections because they treat them almost as a sporting event, though not as entertaining as the Cheltenham Gold Cup. When they think about Parliament, they can barely stifle their yawns. The idea that Parliament could be interesting or important is a peripheral issue within political coverage, which is seen to be primarily about adversarial fun and games.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para50"></a>As a result of the communications Bill, I hope that we shall see a firm commitment, as part of the public service remit, that the activities of Parliament be properly covered by television and radio. I should like the Minister to draw to his colleagues' attention at the DCMS that this is a fundamental matter of public interest which must be protected and not be treated, as it so often is by broadcasters, as an ego-driven whinge <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>from party politicians wanting their speeches covered. I should be grateful if he can pass on the public interest argument to his colleagues.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para51"></a>Finally, having criticised others, we must, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, says, be open to the possibility, that the fault lies not just in the stars, but in ourselves. Does Parliament work sensible hours in a workmanlike way? Is it accessible and accountable?&#151;values much rated in contemporary society. Are its procedures arcane and archaic or straightforward and understandable? Does it have joined-up legislation between both Houses? There is a massive challenge for Parliament to make itself effective and the Government accountable. The Hansard Commission, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, made some very sensible recommendations, some of which were taken up in the report of the modernisation committee last month.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para52"></a>There is a tide for parliamentary reform which comes probably once in a generation, but it is running very strongly. There are now 237 members&#151;Peers and MPs&#151;of the All-Party Group for Parliamentary Reform. The Leader of the House in another place, is open to and, we hope, committed to reform. Will he be remembered like Richard Crossman and Norman St John-Stevas as a parliamentary reformer? There is a mood in Parliament to address this issue, not only in your Lordships' House but at the other end of the corridor. The noble Lord was right to refer to the merits of web consultation. We should use the web to consult with experts and the general public on a regular basis, not just occasionally.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para53"></a> I conclude by asking the noble Lord to add his considerable weight to that of his colleague, the Leader of another place, in trying to move the agenda on from what often seems too much manipulation and populism in Parliament to one of modernisation and participation. That is something for which the Government would be remembered with gratitude for generations.

<A NAME="20313-03_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to discuss the case for raising public awareness of the work of Parliament, particularly at a time when we are facing a complex and rapidly changing environment and when the degree to which it functions effectively, its relationship with government and its success in representing the public, are being increasingly questioned. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Norton on his success in this ballot and the choice of subject.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para54"></a>The work and role of Parliament and the associated issues of parliamentary reform merit far greater discussion. It is a vitally important subject and one to which we do not devote enough time&#151;to the detriment both of democracy and society. Good government and an effective Parliament are intrinsically linked. If we do not have an effective Parliament, not only do we not have good government, we do not have a healthy political system or a vigorous democracy.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para55"></a>In my remarks, I wish to range wider than the current work of Parliament and to look to its future shape and role in national life. I have spoken before of the disconnection between the people and their democratic institutions in this country. While civic life is prized in new societies, in established democracies a growing number of citizens are increasingly questioning the effectiveness of their public institutions. Most developed societies are experiencing a collapse of confidence in traditional methods and models of democratic governance. Our last general election certainly proved this, in contrast to Zimbabwe where people queued for 50 hours or more to vote in the presidential elections, because, deprived of true democracy, they know its worth.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para56"></a>Last year's general election here produced the lowest voter turnout since 1918. Millions of British people were prepared to forgo the opportunity to participate in the democratic process. Some 41 per cent of the population did not vote, and of those who did fewer than a quarter voted for the Government. That underlines the need for a strong Parliament, able to scrutinise legislation and contain the executive, of whichever political hue.
<P>

<a name="20313-03_para57"></a>Since the general election, confidence in politicians and political institutions has continued to wane. Many of your Lordships will be all too aware that more people voted in the final of the television programme "Pop Idol" this year than voted for the Liberal Democrats in the last general election.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I understand that more people voted in that event than voted for the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives in the last election.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree with that. My calculation was that 8.7 million people voted in "Pop Idol" and the collective number would have been greater. However, I may stand corrected once I have checked the arithmetic.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para0"></a>In those circumstances, there is little cause for optimism in the future. Levels of disengagement are likely only to increase, because&#151;and here I totally agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Holme, about the importance of engaging young people&#151;the problem is most acute with the young. Some 61 per cent of the 18 to 25 age group did not vote in the last election. I ask the Minister to pick up on the point that disconnection on that scale among young people poses a significant threat to the long-term health of our democratic institutions.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para1"></a>Voter participation is an essential part of a healthy democracy. While to some extent I understand the argument that we are living in what has been called a post-political age, in which the blurring of the old sharp ideological divides between Left and Right and the crowding of politics on the centre ground mean that people perceive little difference between the political parties and feel that voting one way or the other will make little difference to their lives, the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>malaise goes deeper than that. As the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, said in her farewell address in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The level of cynicism about Parliament, and the accompanying alienation of many of the young from the democratic process, is troubling. It is an issue on which every Member of the House should wish to reflect. It is our responsibility, each and every one of us, to do what we can to develop and build public trust and confidence".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 26/7/01; col. 1114.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-04_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20313-04_para3"></a>I do not believe that the public are more apathetic now than a generation ago, but I believe that there is a misalignment between national politics and local activism. There is no longer a perception that social, economic or environmental problems will necessarily have a political solution. As a result, our political institutions are no longer seen to be the key focus for change.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para4"></a>In many ways, activism is growing, but respect for the political process and the traditional institutions through which politics used to function is collapsing. Today, the targeting of the business world by NGOs and pressure groups is often seen as more likely to be an effective vehicle for change than elective politics. Yet if voters choose to sideline Parliament because they see politics as unfashionable and irrelevant to their lives, there will be grave consequences for society.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para5"></a> Democracy is only as good as its citizens. Good citizenship requires knowledge and participation. We know too much about the perils of dictatorship to indulge in the myth that democracy is simply a designer accessory. Democracy is by no means a perfect system. It has faults, flaws and deficiencies, but after 2,500 years it is still the best and fairest system of government known to man. The commitment to democratic accountability and legitimacy underpins the most successful governments and states in the world.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para6"></a>Representative democracy is critical if competing interests are to be reconciled not only peacefully, but in a coherent way. The collective will of the people must be manifested in our democratically elected Parliament, from which the Government are formed. If our elected representatives lose their authority because their mandate comes from ever fewer voters, the unelected and unaccountable activists will step into that vacuum, claiming that, on a given issue, it is they, not Parliament, who truly represent the people. Mob rule is not far from that scenario&#151;witness the case of the anti-paedophile protests on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para7"></a>The way in which Parliament and politics are presented through the lens of the media is clearly influential in forming public attitudes. Ironically, the overall effect of increased media access to Parliament has been to make the political system seem more distant and less relevant to everyday life. The media have been criticised for dumbing down their coverage of politics. In part that is due to the dog-eat-dog fight for audience share, which means that entertainment is likely to win at the expense of information. That contributes hugely to the current soundbite culture of our political life. This language drives the public away, because they perceive a departure from the politics of conviction towards the politics of expediency.
<P>


<a name="column_841"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para8"></a>Yet it is difficult to expect the media or the public to take Parliament seriously when the Government so often sideline it. The relationship between Parliament and the Government is one of the most fundamental in our democracy. The Government are elected through Parliament and deserve and derive their political authority from that fact. It should be a salutary lesson for governments that if Parliament is undermined, eventually so too will be the authority of the Government. To neglect Parliament is to neglect the body that confers the legitimacy necessary for a government to act and the body that ensures that the views of the public, whom it represents, are taken into account. Parliament is integral to public policy making, not separate from it or inferior to it. Yet we are increasingly drifting towards an executive approach to government, with executive announcements and action taking the place of decision-making through parliamentary debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para9"></a>In that context, Parliament must be able to regulate and police itself effectively. The resignation of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Elizabeth Filkin, her complaints of undue pressure and whispering campaigns and her criticism of the lack of independence and resources to be offered to her successor were highly damaging to the reputation of Parliament. It is vital that Parliament maintains high standards of probity and good conduct, for if it does not, how can it deserve its rightful place at the centre of our national life?
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para10"></a>In closing, I place on record my thanks and admiration for the work done by the House of Lords administration, which has greatly improved public accessibility to your Lordships' House and plays a great role in facilitating understanding of its work as part of Parliament. The challenge that we face&#151;this is a challenge for the Government, for political parties of all complexions and for Parliament&#151;is how to deliver politics in an accessible way and to kindle political interest by ensuring that all people, young and old, are made aware of the relevance of politics to their lives. Voter disconnection from formal politics is not the inevitable outcome of a post-political, information age world. Without a 21st century Parliament for a 21st century Britain, efforts to re-engage the public will meet with only limited success.

<A NAME="20313-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, like others, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, for introducing this debate. Judging by the numbers who have attended it, it has struck a chord with the House&#151;and so it should. As my noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham said, I am president of the Citizenship Foundation, which I founded in 1988. As long ago as 1969, I persuaded a headmaster to allow me into his school for one lesson a week for a year, to see whether I could interest apathetic 15 year-olds in politics and the law. That was a lesson more for me than them and one that I have never forgotten. It was heart-lifting to discover that so-called apathetic, disenchanted and disconnected young people were hugely interested in the moral issues debated in this <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chamber from month to month. But they lacked confidence that anyone was interested in their opinions and the belief that their views were worth developing and expressing.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para11"></a>In the intervening 30 years, those problems have grown substantially. I refer particularly to the sense of powerlessness and civic insignificance of the vast majority of our fellow citizens. We&#151;by which I mean this House and another place&#151;do not understand just how disaffected people feel. I did my stint of canvassing at the last general election. Never before did I hear the constant refrains, "What is the point of voting? Nobody really cares or notices what we think. They only take any interest in us when an election comes around. Our MP is a decent enough person but utterly insignificant. MPs say one thing to your face and vote for something else in the House. They are powerless, so what does that make me?"
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para12"></a>Sheep-like Back-Benchers are shoved through the Lobby night after night, often voting uneasily and sometimes directly against what they feel and believe.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para13"></a>There is a schism between the values that people hold dear in their own lives and the values that they see characterised by Westminster. In their own lives, people value integrity, independence and moral courage. There is a great deal of all that in the Palace of Westminster but the public do not see much of it. Among the most difficult of the thorny issues with which we have to contend is that on which the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, concentrated&#151;the relationship between party discipline and the activities of Members&#151;particularly of another place. Even in this House the situation in that regard is getting worse, not better.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para14"></a>Until we re-establish in the minds of the public a sense that their Members of Parliament are independent agents&#151;albeit governed by party discipline and having to sign up to an election manifesto&#151;with infinitely more freedom to be what the electorate want MPs to be, a great deal else will not succeed.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para15"></a> The predicament in which we find ourselves is even worse than many may think. It is not just that only 39 per cent of the electorate under 25 voted at the last general election, a point to which the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, referred. One third of those under-25s are not registered to vote. If one subtracts them from the 39 per cent, only one in four of under-25s voted at the last election. In the elections for the European Parliament, only one in 10 of under-25s voted. What does that say about politics?
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para16"></a>Party membership is also rapidly declining, which raises a serious problem of the authenticity of government. No longer can governments make the claims that they could when more than 60 per cent of young people and more than 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the total electorate voted in general elections. It is no longer adequate for governments to say, "We have the authority of the ballot box". They do not.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para17"></a>Politics are not in a box but are intimately bound up with the whole of our social and communal strength or weakness. Of the under-30s in this country, more than <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>30 per cent have convictions for crimes of dishonesty or violence. In 1999-2000, the direct costs of crime&#151;not the psychological damage&#151;totalled more than &#163;60 billion. The majority and rising element of that crime was committed by people under 30. Make no bones about it&#151;we have on our hands a sick society. The violent aspect of antisocial behaviour is rising faster than any other. It is simplistic and futile to lay all the blame at the door of Parliament, but our country more than any on earth, except perhaps America, has an intimate connection between politics and its general health.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para18"></a>The Citizenship Foundation has active connections with more than half of all state primary and secondary schools. The gap between the relevance of this place to the so-called ordinary citizen and its actual relevance is enormous and growing, so I totally endorse everything that has been said about increasing the information output. The tiny band of people in our Information Office do wonderful work but there are fewer of them than in a medium-sized public company. We need to reach out.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para19"></a>One thing that we could do is have a speaking list, with each one of us offering to speak&#151;not just to schools but to anyone who wants to hear about the work of Parliament. I do not imagine that any Member of this House would refuse to give half a dozen evenings a year for that purpose. Think what a transformation that would represent&#151;3,000 or 4,000 occasions a year when we would be going out to the public. There could be no more effective sign of our interest.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para20"></a> I was infinitely depressed when, during our debate on the Nice treaty, I moved an amendment requiring the Government to circularise every household with an unbiased, plain English guide to the main issues vis-&#224;-vis the governance of the kingdom. I was depressed by the lack of interest shown by government speakers, who seemed to think that everything was more or less all right because the White Paper that was published last year, price &#163;10.40, was on a website; another pamphlet could be read in libraries; and Peter Hain had made a few public speeches.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para21"></a>We need to do infinitely more. We must get on our horses and go, like Wesley, into the highways and byways to sell our wares. Unless we do, the problems that we confront now will grow worse and worse.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para22"></a>We live in a disconnected, fast-moving world in any event. There is less informal communication than before and a decline in communality and local life. Volunteering and giving are not increasing. The latest statistics show that among the under-30s, there is a radical decline in the giving of both time and money. Even at the seminar at Church House yesterday, the BBC complained that it can no longer connect effectively with the young adult age group. We have a real problem in the form of communal, social and national disconnectedness. There is no easy answer to that. However, some of the suggestions made today will undoubtedly help.

<a name="20313-04_para23"></a>In the final minute allotted to me I shall make a few specific suggestions. First, I suggest that we should have a post-legislative audit or impact assessment. That is because I believe that the volume of legislation is ludicrous and that the complexity of legislation is utterly self-defeating; and I would like to see a duty imposed on the Law Commission to keep track of those matters. We should have more limited-life legislation. We may need to consider carefully a common law approach to statute law, which broadly deals with principles and values rather than the minutiae of our traditional legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para24"></a>We also need to consider the system of elections for Europe. The closed-list system was an affront to democracy. We need to contemplate open primaries because, even with open lists, there is still a gross excess of party membership influence on those lists.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para25"></a>We need to give advance warning of our debates and Bills&#151;an active outreach that will allow us to contact every organisation relevant to our debates and Bills and let them know what subjects are to be debated and the results of those debates. I also believe that the Schools Unit&#151;God bless it&#151;needs 100 times more resources.

I am also grateful to the House of Lords information officer. She has produced an excellent brief of the work that she and her team are doing to try to promote a greater awareness of the role of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para26"></a>I suggest that any debate must start with the government of the day, no matter what their colour. Governments can help to promote greater awareness by treating Parliament with more respect. We need to reverse the growing tendency of Ministers to bypass Parliament and to make statements first to the media. That undermines the authority of Parliament and partly explains why people, particularly young people, do not bother to vote&#151;a point impressively made by the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham. We need to remind ourselves repeatedly that Parliament is supreme. Parliament makes and very occasionally dismisses governments. A strong government needs a strong Parliament. It is in the interests of the government of the day to help restore the authority of Parliament and promote public awareness.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para27"></a>Today we hear much about the modernisation of Parliament. I have now had the privilege of sitting in one House or the other for over 30 years. I am always suspicious of modernisation, which usually means that the government of the day can more easily get their business. I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Norton, with his enormous experience in these matters, nodding in assent.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para28"></a>I give one example of what worries me. There is a suggestion that it may be possible to carry over Bills from one Session to the next. I believe that that would be extremely dangerous and unparliamentary. One of the main disciplines of government&#151;any <P>


<a name="column_845"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government&#151;is to persuade Parliament to accept a Bill by the end of a Session&#151;otherwise, that Bill falls. Equally, of course, it is important for the Opposition of the day. There are occasions on which the only effective weapon available to the Opposition of the day is to talk. They can delay the passage of a Bill if they feel that it is not in the national interest that the Bill should pass. Provided it is done within the Rules of Order of the two Houses, that is perfectly legitimate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para29"></a>I suggest that to allow the carry-over of Bills would tempt the Government of the day to overload the legislative programme, which they already do, and would deprive the Opposition of the day of a legitimate parliamentary weapon. We need fewer and better Bills, not more and worse Bills. I believe that the bad effect of carrying over Bills from one Session to another would blunt public awareness and respect for Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para30"></a>We have also heard about the possibility of a Civil Service Bill. Recent events have made it clear that we need to define more precisely the relationship between Ministers, civil servants and special advisers. For years there has existed in our system of government a key principle of trust between Ministers and civil servants who are devoted to the cause but are wholly non-party political and will loyally serve whichever government are in office. The waters are now muddied. I do not suggest that we should not have special advisers. We are now in that age, and I am very glad that the Committee on Standards in Public Life is now studying those problems.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para31"></a>There is a rumour&#151;I am sure that the noble and learned Lord who is to respond to the debate will be able to comment on it&#151;that Downing Street is trying to hold up the possibility of a Civil Service Bill. I do not expect the noble and learned Lord to tell us what will be contained in the next Queen's Speech. However, I hope that he will be able to scotch that rumour, thus allowing us to say that a Civil Service Bill will have high priority in the Government's programme.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para32"></a>I turn to executive agencies and quangos, which were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, whose enormous experience in the other House we greatly respect. This is another area where there are disturbing developments. Oppositions are always rather cautious and suspicious of quangos. The minute they come into government, of course, they realise how handy they are and tend to increase the number of them.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para33"></a>In executive agencies and quangos, there is now a huge power of patronage, supported by vast sums. The effect that they have on individuals and businesses is very considerable. They are not effectively answerable to Parliament. I am not against executive agencies. Much is to be said for the Government laying down the broad policy and allowing the details to be dealt with by executive agencies. In recent years such agencies have grown enormously, but parliamentary scrutiny of them has not grown to anything like the same extent. That point was made very clearly in a distinguished report from the Hansard Society, The Challenge for Parliament, chaired by my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para34"></a> Equally, I am not against quangos. In a modern age, we possibly need quangos. However, they are often created without any reference to Parliament; for the most part, they are not required to report to Parliament; and they are outside the direct scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Consequently, it is very difficult for Select Committees in either House to scrutinise their work effectively, even if they had the resources to do so.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para35"></a>I suggest that there is a growing gap in effective scrutiny of bodies that have a major role to play in Parliament. This partly explains the lack of public interest and awareness. People will, understandably, ask, "If Parliament cannot do this job, what is the point of us trying to take an interest?" I believe that to be one of the reasons for the decline in the prestige of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para36"></a>In conclusion, I shall mention very briefly four disturbing developments that seem to me to be important for Parliament. The first development is Ministers bypassing Parliament. I am not making a party-political point here because parties of both colours have done it. Secondly, there are the modernisation proposals that make it easier for the Government and more difficult for the Opposition. Thirdly, there is the confusion as regards relationships between Ministers, civil servants and advisers. Fourthly, while methods of government have moved on, Parliament has been overtaken in its attempt to scrutinise these developments. This insidious combination is, I suggest, largely responsible for public apathy and lack of awareness. Only Westminster and Whitehall can put this right.

<A NAME="20313-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Norton, that there is a strong case why we in Parliament should see a big rise in the public awareness of our work. After all, we are here on behalf of the public. I congratulate the noble Lord on moving this Motion. As I see it, the problem is that the public may not really want to be aware of the work that we carry out in Parliament. Many people believe that our work here is far removed from their day-to-day lives. It seems to me that what they are really interested in is the politics that goes on in Parliament, rather than the work. They are interested in the differences of opinion; they are interested in the personal rivalries; and they are interested in the political ambitions. I am not being cynical. I am just trying to be realistic.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para37"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Holme, said that the work of Parliament and the politics of Parliament are inextricably linked. I agree. You cannot just raise awareness of our work without acknowledging the public's interest in our politics. It would be nai
ve to think that we will be judged purely on the quality of our work. We shall also be judged on how we handle the politics. The openness, the honesty and the transparency with which we deal with the country's politics will also affect the interest that the public have in our work. The two are indeed linked.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para38"></a>What should we do about the situation? Let us look at it from the point of view of the public. Perhaps our parliamentary system is not as admired and appreciated by the public as much as we parliamentarians would like to suppose. What we see as useful and helpful procedures, perhaps the public see as fudge and secrecy. Let us take, for example, the decisions reached by the usual channels. This happens every day. We see it as a helpful way of reaching compromises, but it must be pretty mysterious to outsiders. To the outsider, this could be rather like the activities of a secret organisation. Anyway, the public now know that work is done better when it is openly discussed. That is why we should open up our procedures and let people see who takes decisions in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para39"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton, says that our committee work is reported less; I am not sure why, but I believe that this openness is a special feature of our committee work, especially in your Lordships' House. That is why it is much admired. The committees consider things broadly from the public interest point of view. The European Union committees, the economics committee, the Science and Technology Committee and the ad hoc committees all try to make their work relevant to the public interest rather than to the political interest. Like the noble Lord, Lord Norton, I believe that our reporting ought to be a lot more user friendly and better presented, but I know that that work is in hand. I hope that we shall achieve that aim very shortly.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para40"></a>However, we have been slow and late in our attempts to inform the public about our work. An information office in your Lordships' House was established only five years ago&#151;and, more recently, in the other place. The money and staff devoted to it are minuscule. I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Norton, and Lord Phillips. The resources devoted to the press and information office of a government department, a business, or, indeed, of other parliaments are much larger than those that we supply. I do not wish to detract from the work of Mary Morgan and her staff. They deal with 2,000 telephone calls a month when the House is sitting, and ensure that the press is informed about our current work and future business. I also happen to know that it was their initiative that the parliamentary website should be redesigned to make it easier to use and more attractive to the public. I hope that my noble and learned friend the Minister will join me and other noble Lords in congratulating that department on its work.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton, asked if our behaviour is one reason why the public are less interested in our work. My noble friend Lord Sheldon, with his vast experience, thinks that that may be exaggerated. I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. The public should expect high standards of personal behaviour from parliamentarians. After all, parliamentarians are law makers. The public expect law makers to stick to the law, to set standards and to be honest. I agree that exaggerated reporting sometimes leads to unnecessary public anxiety. But if <P>


<a name="column_848"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 848</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>you talk to reporters, they will say that they are responding only to what they feel to be public interest and concern.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para42"></a>Instead of responding to the narrow accusations and political rivalries about which my noble friend Lord Sheldon spoke, it seems to me that we could do far better using these opportunities to break out of the low ground that is currently permeating politics. By regaining the high ground, we could shift the agenda back to the political direction of the country and so create a better understanding of the work that we accomplish in Parliament. Yes, sometimes this kind of action injures its originator. We in the Labour Party are perhaps victims of its rules about disclosure of political donations, but that does not detract from its merits.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para43"></a>I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Moynihan and Lord Phillips, that the real worry about all this is falling participation at elections. There is a danger that the turn-out at the next general election could fall below 50 per cent. Are those who stay away saying that they want to vote for none of the candidates? Are they staying away because they just do not care? The noble Lord, Lord Norton, asks: is it that the public's influence on decisions is getting more and more distant as we join international organisations? Decisions that affect people's lives are becoming more distant. Yet, paradoxically, the world is coming closer together. We may not be sharing the same currency as others in Europe, but it is becoming apparent that we share many of the same values and ideals.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para44"></a>Perhaps to stimulate us we need a campaigning organisation like Greenpeace. In the same way that it stimulated concern about the environment, perhaps we need a similar campaigning organisation to stimulate us to face up to the concerns of the public and to tell us where it believes we have failed. The noble Lord, Lord Holme, is the president of the Hansard Society and the noble Lord, Lord Norton, is on the council. Perhaps they could persuade the society to turn itself into such a campaigning organisation. The Hansard Society seems to be saying to us that we parliamentarians indulge too much in politics and management and too little in governance&#151;not government, governance.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para45"></a>The society calls for more governance by Parliament through scrutiny. The noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, spoke about scrutiny, which would have to be more systematic and better-resourced, not only with more money and people but with more time devoted to it. As the Hansard Society suggests, perhaps Parliament should devote one day a week to scrutinising the work of government instead of simply debating it. I know that we parliamentarians prefer to debate the work and effectiveness of government, but that is largely political. Scrutiny by committees, whose Members have a career in Parliament devoted to scrutiny, would be better understood by the public as a means of scrutinising the work of government. The Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Commission are showing the way in that regard. Such scrutiny would be better understood by the public and would raise their awareness of our work.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para46"></a>I realise that governments like to be judged by results; after all, what could be clearer? As many noble Lords have said, we live in a democracy. A democracy must be concerned about how those results were achieved. So, how can we have a democracy without those systems being open to scrutiny? That effective scrutiny combined with proper information is the key to raising people's awareness of the work of Parliament. In short, if Parliament wants the public to take more interest, it must become more public-friendly in every respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   My Lords, I too to congratulate my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth on initiating this important debate. I agree with his concerns. However, it is worth putting the matter in perspective: in 1949 Christopher Hollis, a Conservative MP of independent inclinations, published a book, Can Parliament Survive?. Three years later, George Keeton, a professor of law, brought out The Passing of Parliament. The issues are not new, but they have intensified in recent years.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para47"></a>I begin by disagreeing slightly with the remarks of my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth. I shall set the record straight: the problem is not that Parliament does not address the issues of public concern. That point is usually made in connection with such matters as the environment, drugs and social issues, which are of great concern to young people. In fact, Parliament does debate those issues frequently. Contrary to the suggestion that health, education, transport and welfare issues are not debated in Parliament, any week's analysis of Hansard would show that Parliament is deeply concerned about those matters and that they are the stuff of parliamentary debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para48"></a>Every day in the other place there are pages of Written Questions on health, education, transport and welfare issues of direct local concern to constituents. That is not the problem; rather it is how the matters are conveyed and perceived. Nor is there insufficient contact with the electorate. All Members of Parliament now spend more time than ever contacting their electorate throughout the week and every weekend. They now use every means of doing so&#151;not public meetings, because the public does not attend those, as their lifestyle offers them so many attractive alternatives. Not least because the parliamentary allowances have been increased greatly, various means are now used to communicate with the electorate, including professional public relations agents and all forms of technology. That means that one can make direct contact with doctors, nurses, pensioners and every interest group to survey their opinions. That happens all the time and on a larger scale than before, so it is not the real problem.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para49"></a> I am in favour of the work of the Information Office here. Until this debate, I was largely unaware of its work, which is perhaps a problem in itself. I am in favour of the work of the Citizenship Foundation, and I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, for his leadership of that body. When I was Secretary of State for Education, I was keen on the <P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>foundation's work with schools, and since then I have participated in many of its activities. I know how good and important the foundation is. I therefore support all those measures. However, any such activity can be like pushing a small stone uphill against a rushing downward torrent.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para50"></a>We must analyse the underlying reasons why we are not projecting ourselves well to the public as was done in the past and why Parliament is apparently held in such low regard. First, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, and others, outside influences have greatly weakened the supremacy and power of Parliament. Globalisation and the need for global and regional solutions, immediate information technology and instant global communication, and the shift of power to Brussels and Edinburgh have rendered other institutions of significant, but perhaps not equal, importance in relation to Parliament. Changing cultures and attitudes are important factors. We live in a non-deferential era&#151;and it is different from 15 years ago&#151;in which instant gratification can prevail. The ambition of many is to earn a good deal of money so that they can retire earlier, rather than to contribute to public life and service. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, made that point also. There is a problem with engaging young people in public life, partly because of their lifestyles, their busy working lives and the increase in two-income households where people wish to devote their free time to their family. Those changes have reduced participation not only in politics but also in church, social and voluntary activities, as noble Lords know.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para51"></a>People will not vote if they feel comfortable and do not think that their vote will affect their lives. That point is highlighted by the contrast between the events surrounding the British election and that in Zimbabwe, where a vote really matters. People will not lobby unless they feel threatened. The lobby today outside both Houses indicates how Parliament still matters, because people feel threatened about a matter on which it will take the ultimate decision. It is disturbing that pressure groups such as Greenpeace sometimes feel that is more important to lobby bodies other than Parliament and the Government to get their way. When the Committee on Standards in Public Life was examining lobbying issues, I was struck when a prominent member of Greenpeace who was asked about parliamentary lobbying replied that supermarkets and consumer targeting matter more than Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para52"></a>When discussing the influence and power of Parliament, we cannot avoid mentioning the role of the media&#151;although it is a hackneyed issue. Robin Oakley, the distinguished BBC correspondent, wrote in a farewell article in The House Magazine:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"newspaper reports of what goes on in the Commons chamber are confined these days to the waspish efforts of a talented band of sketch-writers who largely see the Commons as a vehicle of entertainment, a backcloth to a string of witticisms".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-04_para53"></a><P>

<a name="20313-04_para54"></a>I fear that that is true. That is often the only communication from Parliament that many read in their daily newspaper. It is a sad reflection of how the media now feel that they must respond to what they <P>


<a name="column_851"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regard as public demand and the competition in the media to attract the public's attention. They regard it as more important to report what they think people want to hear and read about, which is so often the negative and the so-called sensational, rather than what we think they should report. All occupations are suffering from the combination of the non-deferential attitude and how they are reported in the media. That applies not only to politics, but also to the Church, the professions&#151;it is beginning to apply to doctors&#151;the business community and many others. Respect must now be earned, while it is often the transgressions of the minority that get all the media attention. I wish that we could change the media in that regard, because it greatly influences how Parliament and its work are perceived, but I fear that it would be extremely difficult to do so. An additional problem is soundbites and confrontation. Soundbites are no substitute for arguments, and two-minute interviews give no opportunity for analysis, as every politician who has been frequently engaged in them knows only too well.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para55"></a>I could talk much more about the media, but we are all aware of the difficulties that it creates for us. So I now turn to Parliament itself. First, composition is a factor in the other place. It is disappointing that such a heavy element of the modern Parliament is composed of people who have known nothing other than politics since their student days. The necessary width of experience is no longer being brought to Parliament. That is partly a function of salary, partly a function of sleaze&#151;if I have the time, I shall comment on that&#151;and partly a function of work pressures.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para56"></a>There is also the apparent irrelevance of Parliament. That too partly comes back to the media. Is Parliament any longer the forum of the nation or is it the media? If it is the media, the sadness is that the interviewers and producers have the power without the responsibility. They have the ability to ask questions but never to find the answers.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para57"></a>That is partly due to the bypassing of Parliament by government, not only by regarding the "Today" programme as more important than making a Statement to Parliament&#151;I deeply regret that&#151;but also because, with a large majority&#151;this is more fundamental&#151;government can be pretty brutal in saying that they can get anything through Parliament whenever they wish to do so, and that neither parliamentary debate nor proper parliamentary scrutiny of legislation matters. Regrettably, that too often seems to be the impression that is created today. Indeed, it is the impression that the Government often give by the way in which they currently bypass Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para58"></a>Something I feel strongly about is the parliamentary atmosphere of confrontation and&#151;if I may put it this way&#151;"yah boo" politics. It is out of tune with the spirit of the time. We all know that it is only a small part of what actually takes place in Parliament&#151;at Prime Minister's Question Time and other Question Times&#151;but it is the part that gets all the attention. I was much struck when judging the final of one of the <P>


<a name="column_852"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Citizenship Foundation's school debates when every single school participating thought that, in order to copy Parliament and show the proper parliamentary process, they spent all their time shouting, jumping up and intervening as happens at the worst moments of Prime Minister's Questions. They clearly thought that that was typical of what happens in Parliament. There is far too much of the confrontation element in the other place, with point-scoring rather than sustained argument. Happily, that is not present in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para59"></a>Much more attention needs to be paid to committee work and Select Committees. Governments need to take much more note of what they do. Select Committee chairmen should be paid, and I am glad to see that we are moving in that direction, and Select Committee work should be seen as an alternative career structure for a Member of Parliament. There is too much other workload pressure on MPs so that they cannot participate, or only a few do, in Select Committee work and in parliamentary scrutiny of legislation, and they do not do it effectively.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para60"></a>On the question of sleaze&#151;I declare an interest in serving on the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;what I regret most about the past five years is that, at a time when sleaze (if I may use that shorthand word due to shortness of time) is actually a small part of parliamentary life, and when most of the aspects being examined are trivial in the extreme, it receives so much public attention that it has the opposite effect to that intended. It gives the public the impression that sleaze is prevalent in Parliament when it is not.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para61"></a>Above all, we need to make sure that Parliament matters. I was saddened to note Peter Riddell, who I greatly respect as a columnist, writing in The House Magazine the other day, that, as a result of Stephen Byers's Statement to Parliament, when it appeared that his ministerial life was secured, Parliament still mattered. It is a rather trivial reason for thinking that Parliament still matters. But one of the problems that exists at the moment is that we have a government who have ignored Parliament too often because they have too large a majority. With smaller majorities, as I well recall in the last years of the Conservative government, Parliament really did matter. Members of the Government have to pay a great deal of attention to what Parliament thinks. When that happens, Parliament is clearly the focus of the nation and the media pay much more attention.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para62"></a>I conclude by saying that I wholly agree with the general analysis of my noble friend Lord Norton, and it is important that we all pay attention to putting this situation right.

<A NAME="20313-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, with the permission of the House I should like to say a few words in the gap, having listened to the debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para63"></a>Many of the comments we have heard this evening turned on people's concerns about a reduction in the reputation of this House and the other place. Indeed, the noble Lords, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market <P>


<a name="column_853"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 853</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Lord Dean of Harptree, referred specifically to the declining reputation. I should like, in the next few minutes, to point to something that we can do and which will influence judgments of people outside. I refer to the way we conduct ourselves in the Chamber.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para64"></a>Next week there is a debate on hunting. It is a controversial debate. I shall take a view and Members of this House will take differing views. Members of the press, stirred by Members of the other place, will pore through the Division List in the House of Lords to look for those Members of this place who have perhaps just signed in, just taken the Oath, not spoken this Session or perhaps not voted on any issue this Session, and who it is quite clear have turned up specifically to vote on the issue of hunting with self-interest in mind.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para65"></a>We can safely predict that some noble Lords will fall into that bracket. They discredit this place. Self-interest will have determined what they do. It will be exploited by the press. The will of the House of Commons may well be undermined because of Members taking such a position.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para66"></a>If there are to be reforms&#151;there have been many which I support and which have been referred to today&#151;let us start by running a House which does not operate on the basis of self-interest and where people cannot simply cannot walk in and vote, as they did in 1989 if I remember rightly on the community charge legislation. We used to laugh about it in the other place. We were told how the Division Lobbies were filled in this place with some who had not voted or seen the place for years, but who turned up because they had an interest in that legislation in so far as they were going to save a substantial amount of money.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para67"></a>That is what creates public cynicism. That is why people become angry at the Houses of Parliament when they see those things happening. I rest my case. Next week, when we look at the Division List, I am sure it will be upheld.

<A NAME="20313-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is a distinguished expert on the constitution. He does great service for your Lordships' House. He is the chairman of our Select Committee on the Constitution and performed another service today by introducing this debate with a speech full of interesting and valuable ideas.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para68"></a>This Motion raises two questions. The first is whether the case for raising public awareness of the work of Parliament is made out. I am sure we all agree that it is. The second question is: if so, how do we do it?
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para69"></a>It is clear that interest in politics at all levels has declined, not just an interest in Parliament. That decline is partly for reasons which are acceptable and perhaps even welcome. Politics is certainly less ideological than it used to be. The failure of socialism as an economic system means that there is now much less difference in substance between the main parties. Class consciousness, in my experience, is a good deal less than it was 40 or 50 years ago.
<P>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para70"></a>Those changes are certainly acceptable and I believe welcome. But there are also less welcome reasons why interest in the political system and in Parliament has decreased. For example, there is less interest in local government because so much of it has been centralised. Central government now tells local authorities what they are to do and how they are to do it. Indeed, we have two Bills before the House&#151;the Education Bill and the Police Reform Bill&#151;which increase the directive powers of central government. And nowadays local authorities raise only a small proportion of their own funds.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para71"></a>We have moved too far from what I suppose was the golden age of local government, which was probably the late 19th century; the age of powerful city corporations in our great industrial cities like Birmingham and Manchester, and the era of the foundation of the London County Council. Indeed, I remember one of the characters who used to inhabit the Peter Simple column in the Daily Telegraph with the ghost of Alderman Foodbottom, who had been the chairman of the Tramways and Fine Arts Committee of Bradford in the great days. I am afraid nowadays even the ghost of Alderman Foodbottom has given up the ghost.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para72"></a>We need to hand powers back to local authorities, including fund-raising powers. That would create more interest in local government. It would also mean that local elections would cease to be no more than glorified opinion polls on the popularity of the current central government. There has never been enough interest in the European Parliament even though it now has significant powers&#151;but that issue is for another debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para73"></a>The decline in public interest extends to the whole of the political process, not only to Parliament itself. We cannot separate the lack of interest in the working of Parliament from the lack of interest in the process. Nothing is more irritating when campaigning than finding a voter on the doorstep saying, "You lot are all the same. You're all in it for what you can get out of it". I, as a campaigner, would much rather find someone saying, "Well, we are all staunch Tories in this house", or even, as once happened when I was campaigning on entry phones in Kensington, a voter who said, "You can stuff yourself up your own soft centre".
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para74"></a>The people who say, "You are all in it for what you can get out of it", usually mean that they are too lazy themselves to take an interest or vote. But, in a sense, they are right&#151;we are all in it for what we can get out of it. But what we get out of it is usually not money. Most of us, I am sure, are financially worse off for our involvement in politics. We are in it, in some cases, because we want office. That is not an ignoble reason for taking part in politics; it is certainly what inspired Winston Churchill for most of his career. We are in it for the excitement and interest of a political career; we are in it for the satisfaction of taking part in an essential function in a democratic society. We need to get those reasons across to the public.

<P>

<a name="20313-04_para75"></a>The decline in interest in and respect for Parliament is blamed on the media. There is less coverage of Parliament than there used to be, but that is largely a symptom, not a cause, of the problem. We cannot force newspapers to print what the public do not want to read, although I agree very strongly with my noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham about the duty of public service broadcasters to keep the public informed about the work of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para76"></a> I do not believe that satirists such as parliamentary sketch writers and Rory Bremner are doing damage because they appeal only to people who are already interested in politics. I do not entirely agree on this issue with the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market&#151;not "Pulman Market" as his name appears on the List of Speakers.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para77"></a>We need to consider whether Parliament itself could do more to raise awareness. I am reluctant to suggest what the House of Commons could do because, unlike a number of previous speakers, I have never served there. But the sight of an empty Chamber for important debates and excessive party points scoring is not likely to increase the viewing figures for the parliamentary channel. Speeches on busy occasions are too often directed towards raising a cheer from party supporters rather than persuading a wider public&#151;and I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, on that issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para78"></a>In your Lordships' House the Information Office does a very good job of telling people what we do. I have been impressed by the briefing papers it has produced for this debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para79"></a>Respect for your Lordships' House is high, perhaps particularly now that the Conservatives no longer have a permanent majority among Members who take a party whip and most of the hereditary Peers have left. But there is still a danger that we will be seen&#151;I have to watch my language here to ensure that it is parliamentary&#151;as a group of "boring old flatulences". "Old", I must confess, we are. At the age of 69 I have reached the average age of Members of the House.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para80"></a>We have to keep an eye on our public image. On one day a few weeks ago, the media coverage of your Lordships' House concentrated entirely on a Parliamentary Question about the House Christmas card&#151;not because of any intrinsic public interest in the House Christmas card; clearly there was none whatever&#151;but because it reinforced the misleading image of ourselves as "boring old flatulences". I do not believe that there will be a real interest in your Lordships' House until most of us are elected and the public feel that, in a sense, we belong to them.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para81"></a>The most important thing for improving awareness and interest in Parliament is education. I agree absolutely with my noble friends Lord Holme and Lord Phillips on this issue. We heard a passionate speech from my noble friend Lord Phillips, who has perhaps campaigned more than anyone else in your Lordships' House to ensure that the public, and particularly young people, get proper instruction in <P>


<a name="column_856"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 856</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>how the political system works. No one, least of all those of us on these Benches, would accuse my noble friend of being a slavish follower of the party line.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para82"></a>I strongly welcome the developments in citizenship education. It is essential that all pupils, not only those studying politics, should get a basic instruction on the constitutional and political system of this country. We should seriously look at reducing the voting age from 18 to 16. That is now the policy of my party. It is a policy about which I have been in the past distinctly sceptical, but I find my mind changing on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para83"></a>When I was a parliamentary candidate&#151;as I was on four occasions&#151;I found that school sixth forms, as they were then called, were the most acute and interested audiences I had to face. But, of course, very few of those pupils were eligible to vote. If pupils became eligible to vote while they were learning about the political system instead of a year or two later, they would be much more likely to vote. Voting would then become a part of the rite of passage into adulthood and, having voted once, young people would be more likely to do so again.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para84"></a>I am delighted to see that the sum which the Electoral Commission is authorised to spend on encouraging public awareness of our political and democratic systems is being increased under a statutory instrument which has recently been laid before your Lordships' House, from &#163;1.5 million per year to &#163;7.5 million. That is certainly a welcome step forward.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para85"></a>There is no single cause of the decline of interest in politics&#151;and in Parliament in particular&#151;and there is therefore no single answer to that problem. The best answer, to borrow a phrase from a right honourable member of another place, is "Education, education, education".

<A NAME="20313-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, on this occasion, as on several others when my noble friend Lord Norton has initiated debates in your Lordships' House on the constitution and related matters, we are most grateful to him for highlighting and so expertly analysing a major problem&#151;that is, that the glorious idea of representation, which is perhaps the essence of our political system, has somehow been lost.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para86"></a>I always feel that debates such as this show your Lordships' House at its best. I remember that on one occasion the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said that the reports of the Select Committees of your Lordships' House should be made compulsory reading in schools, and the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, made similar remarks about our reports. Perhaps it is true that the best and simplest cure for the problems to which many noble Lords have referred is to open up your Lordships' House to visitors.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para87"></a>It is very striking that the public galleries are almost empty. Perhaps we should aim to fill them. For that reason I echo the remarks of my noble friends Lord Dean and Lord Moynihan, and those of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, in praising Mary Morgan and the work of the House of Lords Information Office and <P>


<a name="column_857"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 857</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the new visitor centre. I hope that we follow up some of the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, as to how we can help her with her work.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para88"></a>My noble friend Lord Norton dissected some of the key causes of the problem that is the subject of the debate and applied innovative thought to them. I hope that, when he comes to reply, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will give a positive response to the brilliant analysis given by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, and my noble friend Lord Dean of the problems that exist in our own parliamentary procedure&#151;particularly the "insidious combination" of the four procedural elements described by my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para89"></a>Many noble Lords analysed the symptom of the problem as being low turnout, especially among young people. Some alarming and depressing statistics were given to us. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said that he was so concerned about low turnout among young people that he wondered whether the mandate was not being called into question, which is very serious indeed.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para90"></a>Other speakers concentrated on the diagnosis&#151;on what the underlying causes might be. For adherents of post-materialism, I believe the root of the problem is widespread affluence leading to general contentment&#151;the point was not taken up by previous speakers, but we read a great deal about it. Most speakers took the opposite point of view; namely, that the cause of the problem is widespread discontentment, disillusion and disrespect&#151;the "deep cynicism" of which my noble friend Lord Moynihan and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, spoke.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para91"></a>Many speakers were worried about the media. I refer in particular to the noble Lords, Lord Holme and Lord MacGregor. It will take a major act of will on the part of government to solve this problem. Simon Jenkins once explained to the Nolan committee why, as editor of The Times, he abandoned the full-page parliamentary report. He said that people,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"who want to read . . . what goes on in Parliament can subscribe to Hansard".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-04_para92"></a><P>

<a name="20313-04_para93"></a>That statement is the precursor of the thinking that now dominates broadcasting in our country, both in the commercial ITV companies and in the BBC. It is the thinking that leads to the concept of the "themed" channel, which now dominates broadcasting. Echoing what Mr Jenkins said, the ITV companies say: "If people want to watch news, we have a very nice 24-hour news channel". That is the new conventional wisdom in commercial television. The BBC says much same; namely, that it has conducted research among young people in "digital" homes&#151;it takes this group to be the best predictor of the future shape of society&#151;and that such persons are not interested in politics, and that, therefore, it is inappropriate to provide such programming, other than on a themed channel.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para94"></a>One issue that arises in regard to the BBC&#151;I was grateful to have the opportunity earlier to mention this to the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House&#151;is why the BBC parliamentary channel is, incredibly, available only on audio on the ITV digital <P>


<a name="column_858"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 858</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terrestrial channels which are free, and is available with a normal picture on Sky, which is paid for. In other words, the position we seem to have reached in regard to the BBC parliamentary channel is that a rich man gets a picture and a poor man gets a blank screen. This is hardly the New Jerusalem! I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will use his influence to stop such complete nonsense.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para95"></a>Many noble Lords focused on the possible cure for the problem being "Education, education, education", a phrase employed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I am not sure that he was not closer to the mark in the earlier part of his speech, when he seemed to be getting at the important point that low turnout was not altogether a bad thing.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para96"></a>In reading around this subject before the debate, I found that it is a common view that the problem arises from a low opinion of the public&#151;the suggestion being that they are either ill-informed or dim. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said that we live in a sick society. The implication is that, if only the public knew more, all would be well.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para97"></a>Instead, I ask your Lordships to consider for a moment that the reverse may be true; namely, that the public are very intelligent. Is it not a striking feature of our age that we live in a new enlightenment&#151;it has been described as a "democracy of information"&#151;in which the need to know has been replaced by the right to know. Is it not true that the public know everything? Like the natural philosophers that they are, they know the great changes that have taken place in modern politics. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, touched on that point.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para98"></a>The public see two historic forces at work, which may have led them rationally to conclude that their participation in politics is not as urgent and necessary as it once was. The first of these could have been revealed to them through their knowledge of the game of chess. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world chess champion on whose scientific principles chess is now based, said that it was always good, on principle, to take an opponent's centre pawn.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para99"></a> So it is that, today, the public see that both main parties, chess grandmasters, want their King near the centre of the chessboard. That is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, mentioned, all research now shows that the public say that "all politicians are much of a muchness these days".
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para100"></a>Until recently, the position of the parties on the political chessboard has been very different. For example, the Conservative Party has spent the 20th century successfully depicting our Socialist opponents as totalitarian wolves in the clothing of constitutional sheep. Winston Churchill described the Socialist Party as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Evil, odious and repellent to every friend of freedom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-04_para101"></a><P>

<a name="20313-04_para102"></a>The Conservative Party developed all the winning arguments of our time. We were proud of Conservtive economics and what it could do. We said that "a rising tide lifts all ships". We said that lower tax was good&#151;for moral reasons, because it meant more freedom and choice for individuals; and for economic reasons <P>


<a name="column_859"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because, ironically, lower tax rates meant higher tax revenues and more wealth creation in the long run. As my noble friend Lady Thatcher brilliantly summed it up at the end of the 20th century,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "The facts of life do invariably turn out to be Tory".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-04_para103"></a><P>

<a name="20313-04_para104"></a>But then, of all things, after a victorious century-long battle against Socialism, the facts of life turned out to be Labour too. Under Prime Minister Blair's direction&#151;and who can deny him credit for this?&#151;Labour's Berlin Wall came down. He embraced free enterprise capitalism. He welcomed low tax. He respected work. He admired wealth creation. He said that "the polarities of Left and Right of the 20th century would prove an aberration". He would consign the old Left/Right divide to what Engels called "the museum of antiquities". When Mr Blair went on to offer his beguiling synthesis of capitalism and socialism, the great divide in British politics came to an abrupt end.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para105"></a>I am putting forward the notion that the British public are intelligent enough to see all this in exactly the way that I have just described it. So is it any wonder that the passion for politics has declined? That is the first great force at work which the public see.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para106"></a>Secondly, people are aware of what is perhaps the most monumental change in our lifetime; namely, globalisation&#151;which has shaken up all our institutions and produced an entirely new form of capitalism, which the public can see is beyond the reach of the national governments for whom they are asked to vote with such urgency.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para107"></a>Perhaps I may expand on what my noble friend Lord Norton said about this subject. The public have been told, and have understood, that no man is an island, not even this one; and that it is not the case, as my noble friend Lord Dean hoped it would be, that Parliament is supreme. They have been reminded that, for example, the rule of law requires a compulsory jurisdiction. They have already accepted the degradation of their own sovereignty, because foreign judges already make decisions which they have to accept as a necessary result of the international rule of law. They have been shown how, with global financial markets, economies are interdependent; how environmental problems&#151;the ozone layer, climate change, biodiversity, and so on&#151;cannot be solved at the national level; how the World Trade Organisation cannot allow contravention of rules by one country in pursuit of its own sovereignty.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para108"></a>So, as usual, a shrewd public see it all. They see mega-mergers, global alliances and jobs moving to where it suits global corporations to employ people, and they conclude that fighting globalisation is like fighting Darwinism. So, if we are depressed to discover that the public believe that the globalisation of companies and economics means that the globalisation of countries cannot be far behind, and if we are concerned&#151;as every speaker has been&#151;to hear people express doubts about the relevance of our Westminster Parliament to their lives, perhaps it is because the public are excellent students of economics. <P>


<a name="column_860"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 860</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They can see the economic power of globalisation, and they know that politics follows economics. So, our politics here at Westminster may end up with the same weight as local elections enjoy. We know what has happened to turnouts in local elections.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para109"></a>I want to end on a positive note. It would be wrong to despair&#151;as I think the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, did at one point&#151;that things are getting worse and worse. I am not sure that that is true. It is certainly not happening because people are too dim, uninterested or apathetic. I hope that noble Lords will agree with that, for some of the reasons that I have outlined. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said that the key point is that people like to see differences of opinion, and I agree. All they need to be "heart uplifted"&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said&#151;is to see and hear the clash of real ideas presented by political parties that have a clear and distinct sense of purpose, a certain idealism, and a marching tune to which they can respond. Those are the essential preconditions for the future health and happiness of our great democratic system.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, and all noble Lords who have spoken, for a debate that has gone a good deal wider than the parameters set down in its title. For my part, I think that that was a useful widening.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para110"></a>All the speeches seemed to demonstrate one point: we all have a common purpose in this House that unites our thinking even if we do not always come to identical conclusions&#151;which is that all governments require effective scrutiny. Governments therefore require this House to run as effectively as possible, so that scrutiny can be diligent, continuous and informed. A number of noble Lords have spoken about what we do. What we do is important; how we do it is critical. It is interesting&#151;indeed amusing&#151;for someone who has never been a Member of the House of Commons to note that, on an occasion like this, the most swingeing criticism of the House of Commons has come from the recently and dearly departed who had formerly sat there. So all the sinners begin to repent when they enter a more civilised Chamber.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para111"></a> I thought&#151;if I may say so without offence&#151;that the analysis from the noble Lords, Lord Dean of Harptree and Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, was extremely interesting. The criticisms of the noble Lord, Lord Dean, included&#151;if I have them noted correctly in my mind&#151;first, criticism of Ministers bypassing Parliament; secondly, concern about modernisation proposals; thirdly, the relationship between Ministers, civil servants and political advisers; and, finally, his feeling that, in some ways, Parliament has perhaps been overtaken in its true scrutiny role. He specifically mentioned the question of carry-over.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para112"></a>As your Lordships know, there is a Leader's group composed of a few of us who are working on trying to achieve a consensus on changing, and I hope improving, the way in which we work. The noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_861"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 861</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Waddington, has been in the Chamber for much of the debate, and the noble Lord, Lord Roper, has been here throughout. We are working together on that. What I hope we shall be able to show to your Lordships is the possibility of being more effective in the duties that we should carry out. Some of your Lordships have said on many occasions that what we really need is an improved method of legislating. That would imply no longer seeing 1,000 or 2,000 government amendments. I think that it is fair to say that, in the past nine months or so, that sad history has been expunged or at least significantly improved. I have no doubt that the real answer to that is to have proper pre-legislative scrutiny. Although that will make life harder for the Government, I can bear it with some fortitude.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para113"></a>We all have the common desire to get the best possible legislation. It seems to me that the House's current Committee scrutiny is not satisfactory and ought to be divided conceptually into two. The first aspect is the Bill's policy, on which there may be no agreement between the Government and the Opposition parties. Secondly, however&#151;even if there is disagreement about policy and the concepts&#151;we ought at least to deliver proper, effective and workmanlike legislative product. If we could achieve a situation in which most significant government Bills were subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, and the co-relative benefit was&#151;as I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dean, suspects&#151;a likely carry-over, it seems that we would then be able to work together to get good legislation even if we disagreed on the policy content.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para114"></a>There are the questions of public perception to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, referred. As he knows, I pay tribute to his work with the Citizenship Foundation&#151;to which he introduced me long ago when I was at the Bar and was able to join in on his mock trial projects, which were extremely successful. I suggest to your Lordships that it is no longer tolerable that it should be assumed that attendance in Committee, on Report or at Second Reading is somehow an optional extra in which one may indulge or not as the case may be. The fact is that this is and ought to be a full-time House, even if it is currently staffed by part-timers. I should be grateful if your Lordships could assist me in explaining to the public why we do not work in the mornings and have two and a half months off in the summer, but at the same time say that we cannot introduce important&#151;I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;Law Commission Bills. I have never been able to explain that to the public.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para115"></a>I suggest that we shall have to have a sea-change in the way in which we work. We should not be sitting after 10 o'clock at night, and we should be doing our work of bringing the government to account much more effectively. One of the effective weapons in this Chamber is not the yahoo antics&#151;as some of your Lordships have described them; I could not possibly agree with that&#151;practised elsewhere, but the daily Question Time. That is one of the most effective occasions in this place, if your Lordships wish to make it effective. It will be for your Lordships to decide <P>


<a name="column_862"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 862</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether, as I have suggested, we should expand that. At least to start off, on an experimental basis, we could have perhaps five Questions per day. I have offered this change, and I hope that your Lordships will wish at least to consider it as an experiment. Question Time is a ready, continuing, daily weapon for Opposition parties to challenge Ministers, who have to be briefed and able to explain themselves.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para116"></a>There are many other devices by way of modernisation&#151;or improvement, if modernisation is too jarring a word for our activities&#151;and other proposals that we could consider. If we have the unity of purpose that we have demonstrated this afternoon, I have no doubt that, even if it is on an experimental basis, we shall be able to improve our practices. It is right that we are regarded as arcane by many of those whom I have almost described as voters&#151;the gloomy feature is that they are not voters; some of them are not even registered. We have to bear in mind, of course, that turnout in the American presidential election was even worse. Fewer than 50 per cent of those who are registered&#151;and registration there is not good, at about 48 per cent, if my memory is correct&#151;vote in those elections.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para117"></a>Some of those who might be interested in politics plainly are not interested because of the extraordinary divorce between our experience, as we believe it to be, and their knowledge of their existence. When we spend day after day after day arguing about Section 28&#151;still unresolved&#151;and day after day on the age of consent, they simply come to their conclusion, with which I entirely sympathise, that we inhabit not a different world but a different planet and insult them by our lack of knowledge about how they live their lives and wish to construct their futures.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para118"></a>It was said by the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, that the media have a responsibility. That is true. However&#151;I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, is not in the Chamber; as a collector of political cartoons he would have the knowledge to respond to this fully&#151;if one thinks of Rowlandson, Gilray and Hogarth, to take but three examples, one might think that the media are not entirely devastating at the moment.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, raised a particular aspect of the media which is important. I am grateful to him for his courtesy in warning me about the BBC. I believe that we are entitled to say that if the BBC, uniquely constituted and funded as it is, is to continue, those who fund it on a compulsory basis are entitled to say that part of the public service interest ethos must be to give a full and proper review of parliamentary procedure&#151;not an uncritical one. It seems to me&#151;I am speaking personally and heading for, I expect, immediate dismissal&#151;that the purpose of the BBC is not only to be described as aiming for the highest possible ratings and possibly going hand-in-hand with the lowest common denominator.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, asked questions about video on which I have had research conducted. It is right that the Government allocated digital terrestrial television capacity to the BBC. There is not <P>


<a name="column_863"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 863</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sufficient capacity on the BBC's multiplex for it to broadcast "BBC Parliament" on digital terrestrial television in full video, but I am able to reassure your Lordships that the BBC is actively exploring options to enable that service to be provided in full video, which is welcomed by DCMS. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the matter.
<P>

<a name="20313-04_para121"></a>The rest of the media have been criticised partly because of parliamentary sketches. But parliamentary sketch writers can be amusing and critical&#151;I see the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, shaking his head in disagreement&#151;only if on occasions the performance offered justifies such descriptions. Sometimes the descriptions are over-harsh and sometimes they are over-obsessive, but if we have a good debate in your Lordships' House we generally receive good credit for it. Sadly, for our families, not all of our speeches are reported in full, even in the broadsheets, but if we have a good debate we normally receive a decent response.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   My Lords, the quotation from Robin Oakley was not critical of the satirists&#151;I am certainly not, as they raise parliamentary awareness. The point was that they concentrated so much on those aspects that insufficient attention was given to reporting more serious matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord. Of course, the sketch writers are part of a wider spectrum which includes those aspects of the media referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi. Taken as a whole, we should be entitled to look to the broadcast media, which is probably the way that the majority of young voters receive information about politics. I do not believe that most of them scrabble for the parliamentary sketches, whatever paper they happen to read, because I am sorry to say that most young people do not read newspapers. Most of them take such information from the television or the video.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para0"></a>Mary Morgan and her colleagues carry out an extraordinarily good job of work and they are thinly resourced. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said something that struck a chord in my mind. Other noble Lords hinted at it, sometimes more brutally in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who said that we are a sick society. I do not believe that we are. I believe that we remain a generous-hearted country which could do better. Fundamentally I believe it is a decent, good and tolerant society, civilised in its accommodation of other people's different views. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, pointed to the fact that we are now a less deferential society, which is undoubtedly true. The juries of my youth, which was not pre-flood, were always dressed in a collar and tie and a suit. Now people sit there in T-shirts.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para1"></a>The world has not become worse, but it has changed and our experience is different. Non-deference is quite good in a society that has been over-obsessed with secrecy and the proposition that those set in authority over us are necessarily always right on every conceivable occasion. My experience shows that not to be a universal truth.

<a name="20313-05_para2"></a>Part of the remedy must lie in our own hands. We need a visitors' centre. Comparing the workings of our Chamber with other chambers in other parts of the world, I visited the Basque Parliament in Vitoria and the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. I went unannounced so they were not doing me a great favour. On entering the Scottish Parliament one is immediately made welcome and made to feel that they want to see you. The information is readily available; the facilities for the broadcast media and the print media are in place.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para3"></a>I believe that little is required for our two Chambers except a modest amount of thought. The necessary resource would be limited. If one considers other quite new chambers&#151;our colleagues in Spain post the Franco regime and those in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff&#151;one sees that they have the advantage of not being encumbered with the wrappings of tradition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I suspect the Minister saw that the visitor centre in the Scottish Parliament is constantly full of children, particularly primary school children, who visit in school time. They are very interested in the interactive arrangements that they can enjoy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I did notice that. It struck me that that is a useful device. That is a young Parliament, using imagination and a certain amount of resource, but it is not vastly extravagant. In Belfast children visit the Chamber, which faces difficult circumstances, to act out the roles of Speaker and so on. Those are small steps, but incrementally they are capable of bringing about good consequences.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para4"></a>How do we raise public awareness of the work of Parliament? I bear in mind one noble Lord's cautionary note, that if we do not do very well and people know more about us the conclusion will not be entirely gratifying. I believe that we should try to focus on scrutiny of the Government, general revision of legislation and debates of this kind. There are many parts of every notional parliamentary week when we are not using the time: in the mornings, except for committee work, often on Fridays and for a large period in the summer.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para5"></a>I hope that noble Lords will join with me in what I believe to be our common purpose and I shall seek their support when we try to improve ourselves. If we make improvements to the work that we should carry out, undoubtedly those improvements will resonate with the public; and the public, whom we try to serve, will benefit as will this House, which I believe we all respect and want to serve in the best possible way.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para6"></a>I repeat my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Norton. In 16 or 17 minutes I have not been able to deal with all the points that have been raised. I simply refer back to my original proposition. There is a common theme: we believe that this House is of substantial quality. I do not have the curse of the noble Lord, Lord Pym, in having any kind of majority, being 21 short of the main Opposition party. There may be a moral there, but if there is I shall not attempt to draw it.

<A NAME="20313-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth: </B>   My Lords, I have great pleasure in thanking all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. It has been an extremely worth while debate. I take on board the points that have been made. There has been a common theme and a recognition of a common problem, which is the disconnection between people&#151;especially young people&#151; and Parliament. Affluent young people with access to the Internet are not interested in politics, but at the last election the lowest turnout was among those from the areas of greatest social deprivation. We face that very real problem. The problem of disconnection is not simply confined to Parliament; nor as my noble friend Lord Moynihan mentioned, is it necessarily confined to this country. Other countries face similar problems.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para7"></a>A major task to be undertaken is almost a re-creation of civic society. I agree that a large part of the route is through education. I declare an interest, as I spend all my time in education. There is great progress to be made. My experience of talking to schools throughout the country is that one can gauge that people are interested in issues. I take the point raised by my noble friend Lord MacGregor that those issues are variously debated, but not in a way that resonates outside and not necessarily to the extent that I would like. Although it is true that more and more constituents go to see MPs, they are still in the minority. There is a great deal more to be done to connect with the people in this country to make them more aware of the work of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para8"></a>A central point that has been made is that Parliament is part of the problem. It must also be seen as part of the solution. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on audit and accountability in central government: government response to the Sharman report Holding to Account. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20313-05_para10"></a>"With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the Government's response to Lord Sharman's report Holding to Account which made recommendations about audit and accountability in central government. Copies of the Government's response, Audit and Accountability in Central Government are available in the Vote Office [the Printed Paper Office].
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para11"></a>"The structure of audit and accountability, springing from the Gladstonian reforms, is an important matter. This House, and the country, have benefited enormously from the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the National <P>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 866</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>Audit Office, which&#151;while accountable to this House&#151;have a remit that is independent of both Government and Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para12"></a>"Over the years, Members of this House&#151;and particularly the Committee of Public Accounts&#151;have expressed concern that the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General had become artificially restricted.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para13"></a>"It has been the general practice of this Government to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit each non-departmental public body set up since 1997 under our control.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para14"></a>"But despite this commitment to openness, there are still significant areas of central government where the Comptroller and Auditor General is not the auditor&#151;including around 50 non-departmental public bodies that had been established previously with auditors appointed by individual Secretaries of State. And in a number of areas, he is also dependent on negotiated administrative access.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para15"></a> "In debates on the Government Resources and Accounts Bill the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit was raised and I undertook to review the position.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para16"></a>"Accordingly, I set up an independent review of audit and accountability in central government to look at all areas of the accountability framework, and to take evidence from a wide range of interested parties.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para17"></a>"I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, for leading that review, and to all members of the steering committee, including the right honourable Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the right honourable Member for Swansea West (Alan Williams) and the honourable Member for Newbury (David Rendel).
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para18"></a>"The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, reached independent conclusions and made recommendations that were addressed to the Government, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Public Accounts Commission. The response I am publishing today sets out the Government's position in relation to Lord Sharman's report.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para19"></a>"In considering Lord Sharman's recommendations and how to carry them forward I have been very mindful that reforms need to command confidence on all sides of this House. They also need to be workable. I am very grateful for the constructive discussions that have taken place with the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff which are reflected in the response.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para20"></a>"I am pleased to inform the House that the Government have accepted the main recommendations that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, directed to the Government and that we support those addressed to others.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para21"></a>"There are five central recommendations: first, the Government agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General should audit all non departmental <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_867"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 867</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>public bodies. This will make him the auditor of bodies such as the Environment Agency, English Partnerships, English Heritage and the Housing Corporation.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para22"></a>"Secondly, subject to legislation, this extension to non-departmental public bodies will include those that are established as companies; for example, the Student Loans Company, the Film Council, the National Consumer Council and the National Forestry Company.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para23"></a> "Thirdly, the Government agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have statutory access to the documents needed for his audit work in place of the current non-statutory arrangements. We welcome arrangements proposed by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that this right of access is exercised so as to minimise any additional burdens on either public or private sector bodies.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para24"></a>"His access to documents in completing value for money studies will be extended by right, for example, to registered social landlords, train operating companies and contractors, including those in PFI contracts.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para25"></a>"Fourthly, the Government's response makes clear our commitment to ensuring the information that underpins the reporting of progress against PSA targets is reliable, and accepts that there should be an extension of external validation of departmental data systems that relate to these targets. The Government intend to invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to take responsibility under his existing powers for the validation of such data systems, usually on the basis of a three-yearly review.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para26"></a> "Finally, the Government welcome Lord Sharman's acknowledgement of the steps being taken to promote strong management and innovation across government in the delivery of public service.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para27"></a>"Before implementing these proposals, the Government will consult bodies affected by the changes.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para28"></a>"I am confident that the proposals we are setting out today will strengthen audit and accountability and improve transparency, in the interests of this House and all those we represent.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para29"></a>"I commend these new arrangements to the House".
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for letting me have an earlyish copy of the Statement this morning.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para30"></a>It is a splendid aim, shared on all sides of the House, to give the public sector a proper balance sheet and proper accounts, based on clear, simple and rigorously defined rules. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman&#151;I am sorry to see that he <P>


<a name="column_868"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 868</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is not in his place&#151;for leading the way with his report last year which has stimulated this belated response from the Government today.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para31"></a>There is much need for improvement in the compilation and presentation of government accounts; for better rules which show us what the taxpayer owns; how it is being used; and what it is being spent on. We are agreed that we need better information on that. Therefore, we welcome the Government's acceptance of the attempts of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and the Public Accounts Select Committee in another place by including in the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General the over 1,000 non-departmental public bodies which currently employ 30,000 people and spend &#163;25 billion of taxpayers' money a year.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para32"></a>I wish that I could stop there because if ever there was an issue that deserves to be dealt with on a cross-party consensus basis, that must surely be it. But I am afraid that the current situation, even after the worthy attempt with the Government Resources and Accounts Bill and this response today, is that unfettered discretion still resides in the Treasury so far as concerns the compilation of accounts; there are no clear principles for the accounting of income or expenditure, and we still permit the Treasury to continue to omit large public assets and liabilities from the national balance sheet.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para33"></a>There are at least three areas of major concern which the Government did not address in their response today. First, the accounting treatment of billions of pounds a year of tax credits is not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. By breaching OECD guidelines the present accounting treatment allows the Treasury to paint a more flattering picture of a key issue, which is government spending, by excluding their amount&#151;now heading with the new Tax Credits Bill to perhaps &#163;15 billion of public expenditure a year&#151;from the total.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para34"></a> Secondly, let us consider the question of liability, which is not mentioned in the response. We are desperately lacking in that regard. We have no proper account of the great and growing liabilities of the public sector in relation to, for example, pensions. The public state pension represents an enormous and ballooning liability not just in this country but in many others. We need clarity in regard to the scope and scale of that liability. We have just seen the impact on private company accounts of the new FRS 17 accounting rule, but we have no idea what would be the impact on the public accounts of applying that accounting treatment to final salary schemes in the public sector.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para35"></a>Thirdly&#151;we discussed this matter at Question Time today&#151;we need to understand far better than we do at present what are the real liabilities that arise each time a project is implemented in the public/private sector under PPP, where the public sector establishes a contract that effectively enforces on it a series of payments over a long period of time that currently do not appear in the public accounts at all. We have seen with Enron the dangerous practice of allowing a build-up of debt to be hidden off the balance sheet. Despite <P>


<a name="column_869"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 869</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what the Minister said at Question Time, there is widespread concern that that is what is happening with public/private partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para36"></a> It was concerns such as those that led the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, to press for new measures to create greater scrutiny of audit and accountability in government organisations. We shared many of the views that he expressed. We both suggested a wider role for the NAO and the C&AG. For example, during the passage of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill we both asked for the statutory right of the NAO and C&AG to be extended to all non-departmental public bodies, including the BBC.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para37"></a>As the Minister will well remember, during the passage of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 we, together with the Liberal Democrats, moved amendments to provide for the NAO to audit the Financial Services Authority, but they were refused by the Government. I am therefore deeply disappointed that today's Statement continues to exclude two of the most important public bodies in the land&#151;the BBC and the Financial Services Authority&#151;from NAO scrutiny. Perhaps the Minister will explain why that vital exclusion continues.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para38"></a> We need a clear, complete and comprehensive set of accounts. They must be composed under standards of accounting practice so that people have at least a chance of doing the detective work to find out what is really happening. That is democratically proper and a matter of common sense; we do not have that after this Statement.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, in rising to respond to the Minister's Statement, perhaps I may say on behalf of my noble friend Lord Sharman how sorry he is that he cannot be in his place today. Having spoken to him in the light of the Government's response, I know that I speak for him when I say that he very much welcomes their response to his report. Indeed, those of your Lordships who have had the chance rapidly to digest the 55 pages of the Government's response in the available time will be aware that 98.5 per cent of my noble friend's recommendations have been adopted by the Government. Obviously, we welcome that.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para39"></a> I cannot comment on the criticisms made by the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, which appeared to have little to do with the Statement. Had he given me advance notice of the extra items that he proposed to raise, I should have said whether I agreed with them. I had the advantage of an hour's notice of the Government Statement, but not of the noble Lord's separate statement on another topic.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para40"></a>Having broadly welcomed the fact that 98.5 per cent of my noble friend's recommendations have been adopted, I shall cavil with two of the Government's responses and then finish with a general comment. Recommendation 2 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All departments should have a formally constituted audit committee. Some basic principles for audit committees include that they should".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-05_para41"></a><P>


<a name="column_870"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 870</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
There follow seven or eight requirements that recognise that the bodies to be subject to audit committees are not corporate bodies, but that several of the requirements of audit committees of corporate bodies should be adopted.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para42"></a> I am concerned by the Government response in paragraph 2.5 on page 12 of the report, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, central government is a wide and diverse field, and central government bodies are not identical to companies. In particular, unlike companies, government departments do not have a corporate board structure from which informed non-executives with statutory responsibilities . . . can be appointed to the audit committee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-05_para43"></a>
The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Existing Treasury guidance will continue to be developed in the light of the above considerations, Lord Sharman's recommendations, and other factors as appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-05_para44"></a>
Well, if ever I have heard the Civil Service preparing itself for not doing very much with a recommendation, that is it. I am concerned that the recommendation will be lost in the realm of Whitehall and that the principles for audit committees developed in the private sector will not be satisfactorily adopted as my noble friend recommends.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para45"></a> My second cavil, which I share with the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is with regard to the BBC. In recommendation 7, my noble friend's committee said clearly that the BBC should be brought within the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General. His report points out that the 1999 Davies review of the BBC recommended the same thing. I am not persuaded by paragraph 2.33 of the Government's response that the BBC should be excluded. No satisfactory reason is given why the Government reject that recommendation.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para46"></a> Those are two points of substantial detail. In concluding my remarks, I should tell the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, that I well remember that in the private sector&#151;probably following the Maxwell affair&#151;an enormous industry was created with regard to audit and audit control. The private sector now recognises that in many cases the baby was thrown out with the bath water&#151;to use an unfortunate pun. I refer noble Lords to recommendation 17 of the Sharman report, which the Government should bear continuously in mind. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Accountability mechanisms are perceived by some in government as a discouragement to innovate and change, but this appears to be only one of a number of complex factors . . . Whilst acknowledging this, it is important that auditors recognise the dangers of being perceived as discouraging well managed risk taking, and ensure that their work lives up to the spirit of statements made on attitudes to innovation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-05_para47"></a>
If every audit committee and every auditor in both the private sector and the public sector lived up to that, the world would be a better place.

<a name="column_871"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 871</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, referred to them only towards the end of a, shall I say, wide-ranging speech. The issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi&#151;his accusation about the unfettered discretion of the Treasury, for example&#151;need to be examined. I should be happy to have an opportunity to respond to them. Issues about tax credits, long-term pension liabilities and liabilities under public-private partnerships all deserve to be debated&#151;perhaps it would be appropriate for that to be in Conservative time&#151;but not today.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para48"></a> The Sharman committee was set up to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consider suitable arrangements for the audit and accountability of central government in the 21st century on behalf of Parliament".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-05_para49"></a>
 It was especially concerned with the role and power of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is what the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, did and I congratulate him on an excellent job.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para50"></a>In so far as the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, referred to the report and our response to it, he made valid points. It is true that we did not accept the recommendation of either the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, or, earlier, Gavyn Davies, for the BBC. In view of Gavyn Davies' subsequent appointment as chairman of the BBC, we seriously considered his recommendation again. But the important point is that we want to avoid not only the reality but also the appearance of any interference with the editorial independence of the BBC. It was on that basis that we decided not to take action or to agree with the recommendation.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para51"></a>The BBC is, after all, set up by Royal Charter. The Royal Charter requires that it should be audited by a company regulated by private audit standards and with membership of the appropriate professional body. It would require an amendment to the Royal Charter of the BBC to change the audit arrangements and bring them under the National Audit Office. Although the National Audit Office is, of course, independent, we are reluctant to run any risk that the internal finances of the BBC could become issues for political debate. That is why, after much consideration, we rejected that amendment.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, referred to the Financial Services Authority. He knows that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, made no recommendations about the FSA. He said that the arrangements should be left alone. The FSA is a company limited by guarantee; we would need primary legislation to have it audited by the National Audit Office. There is some reassurance in the fact that the Treasury can commission value for money inquiries within the work of the Financial Services Authority, and there is no reason why those should not be carried out by the National Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para53"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, spoke about audit committees. The difficulty with the public sector and particularly with central government is that we do not have non-executive directors responsible to departments in the way in which companies do: <P>


<a name="column_872"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 872</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps we should. It is a legitimate point. But, having said that, we think that the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in recommendation 2 are valid.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para54"></a>I can confirm, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said, that the response to virtually all of the report is positive. I repeat my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and all his colleagues for the report.

<A NAME="20313-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend the Minister. The report is a valuable contribution to the work of the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office. For years, the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office wanted to be able to audit all non-departmental public bodies. What we got was an agreement that all the new ones would be audited, and that practice was maintained. It is good to know that all the others will now be given that treatment.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para55"></a>The Housing Corporation was a particularly difficult case; we were given it only on sufferance. It was a concession to the National Audit Office to allow it to investigate the billions of pounds that was spent. That was an outrage. My noble friend has spoken about the valuable agreement that he was able to obtain on that issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para56"></a> With regard to the value for money aspects, I was pleased to hear that the issue of social landlords would be dealt with. I shall also say a word about the BBC. The BBC, of course, has a Royal Charter, as my noble friend said. However, we discussed the World Service, and we took evidence from John Tusa, who came before the Public Accounts Committee. We were able to get those accounts audited.
<P>

<a name="20313-05_para57"></a>All in all, it has been a good job. I congratulate my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have little to say about that, as it is entirely congratulatory, except to thank my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para0"></a>The difference between the World Service and the rest of the BBC is that the World Service is, of course, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, whereas the rest of the BBC is funded by grant under the licence fee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is certainly to be congratulated on his report, and the Government's acceptance of a number of his recommendations is welcome. However, as the Minister knows, the issues were debated in connection with the Government Resources and Accounts Bill. After a considerable time lag, we are now doing what we originally debated, which the Government should have accepted in that Bill. The problem with all such matters is that it takes an enormous number of years for government time to be found for legislation. Now that we are making some progress, apparently, can the Minister say whether we are likely to need further legislation? Will there be a further Bill?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para1"></a>My second point is that no amount of improved arrangements for government scrutiny will help if the accounts themselves are defective. With great respect, I say to the Minister that he cannot suggest that that is a separate issue. There is a huge register of government assets and a totally deficient attempt to estimate the Government's liabilities and create a proper balance sheet, particularly with regard to departments and the whole of government accounts. That must be done right, particularly with regard to the long-term liabilities relating to national insurance pensions. In many ways, we are going through a pensions crisis, and we need to know what the situation is relating to intergenerational transfers. We can do that only if the Government make the effort to provide us with a proper balance sheet. Only if that is done and the accounts are generally improved will the kind of improvement that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, proposes and which the Government have accepted operate efficiently in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I accept that it is legitimate to ask why it took a year to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. There may be an element of administrative delay; I do not know, and I do not think so.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para2"></a>I can give two answers that, I hope, will be helpful. The first is that the response is a full response. It covers all the matters. We could have dealt only with the easy ones and said that we would deal with the others later. We could have responded in a couple of months and got some cheap plaudits for that, but we would not really have been any further forward.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para3"></a>The second answer is that the issue of audit following the money where it has gone is a difficult one, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, remembers from the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. There are issues relating not only to the effectiveness of audit but to intrusion on private companies and individuals who may be in receipt of government money. In some cases&#151;for example, those relating to value for money in the expenditure of government money&#151;it may be legitimate to pursue audit; in other cases&#151;for example, if people are receiving money as pensioners&#151;it may not be.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para4"></a> Much of the time between the publication of the report and the response has been used in the preparation of protocols between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Government on access to contractors, companies receiving government money, grant recipients and so on. Those protocols have been prepared. There is still a necessity for consultation, so the process is not complete, but that is a significant reason for the delay. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will agree that it is a legitimate reason.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para5"></a>The noble Lord also asked me to say when we are likely to bring forward legislation following the review of company law. The document was produced last summer, and it was almost too heavy to lift. As I have said in the House, drafting is going on, but there will have to be some form of consultation, either on a draft Bill or on draft clauses. It is well known that I cannot <P>


<a name="column_874"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 874</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commit the Government to legislation in a particular Session, but I can assure the noble Lord that the matter is, for obvious reasons, not being neglected.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para6"></a>The noble Lord made a third point about defective accounts. I would be happy to listen to and respond to the arguments in due course. I am as interested when he makes the point about long-term pensions liability as I am when the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, makes it. But it is not an issue covered by the Sharman report. It is a matter of enormous concern, not only to this Government but to all governments and it is a matter which deserves debate in Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, as one who had the honour of being a Member of the Public Accounts Committee in another place during my brief sojourn there, I should like to thank the noble Lord for his presentation this afternoon and the Government for making some progress towards a reorganisation of the accountancy profession to give greater public accountability.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para7"></a>This problem of organisation is a good step to have taken but it begs the whole question: accountability means what it says. It means that people are informed exactly what is happening. These measures do not advance accountability at all. I am an old-fashioned accountant. I have been connected with the Institute of Chartered Accountants since 1930 and have played an active part in it. I can remember the time when the purpose of an audit was to arrive at a true and fair view. All that has gone out of the window.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para8"></a>We now have a situation which will be endlessly enlarged upon in the course of the Enron investigations, to find out whether we know anything about our accounting standards at all and whether accounting standards meet the requirements of democracy for accountability. My respectful suggestion is that they do not.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para9"></a>Moreover, although there are many ways in which the Government are responding to a desire for greater responsibility, regrettably it is a fact that when the Government try to answer Members of Parliament and your Lordships, they are already reluctant to come forward with facts in their possession. They will make it more difficult for questioners to put down Questions than they have done for a number of years.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para10"></a>Accountability and accounting standards require our urgent attention if democracy is to survive in its parliamentary form in the United Kingdom. I am quite sure that events will justify the prophecy that I have just ventured to make.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there are two points that I need to make in response to my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para11"></a>First, the report and the response are about audit and accountability in central government. Broadly speaking, what the report and the response say is that we have in the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee a system for achieving independence and accountability which has stood the test of many years and is no longer an issue of party debate.
<P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 875</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para12"></a>The independence of the National Audit Office from government, the fact that it reports to Parliament rather than to government and is still, to a large extent, independent of Parliament, is something which has been confirmed and recognised by both the report and the government response.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para13"></a>On the second point about audit standards, again it is nothing strictly to do with the Sharman report, but my noble friend will know that my noble friend Lord Brennan has a Motion down for debate next Wednesday in Labour Party time, precisely on these issues. I shall have the privilege of responding to that debate and shall look forward to the points raised from all parts of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, the Minister may know, that having served on the Public Accounts Committee for 18 years, the bulk of them under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, I welcome the Government's Statement today which goes far to implement recommendations made over many years.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para14"></a>I hope that in his reply to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, the Minister was not cutting down on the principle that used to be expressed so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, that it was the proper responsibility of the National Audit Office to follow public money wherever it went.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para15"></a>The Minister appeared to be erecting a countervailing principle of the right to some commercial confidentiality in certain circumstances which could be invoked in defeasance of that broader public principle. I hope the Minister will be clearer about that. The Government's rejection of the recommendation of the Sharman report, and indeed of the Davies report with respect to the BBC, seems to fly in the face of that broad principle of following public funds.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para16"></a> In admitting that the Public Accounts Committee has investigated the spending on a report of the NAO on the World Service, he does not seem to have recognised that it is perfectly possible to do that without threatening the editorial independence of the BBC in respect of the World Service. The same is true of its domestic broadcasting function.
<P>

<a name="20313-06_para17"></a>In view of the fact that the matter is still under discussion in the context of the BBC's future and the future of broadcasting, I hope that the Government will reconsider this and listen to the first opinion of Mr Gavyn Davies. That was clearly expressed and carried great weight with all of those who were concerned about the responsibilities of that public service broadcaster.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make two points. The first relates to following the money wherever it goes. Perhaps I did not make myself clear to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. The important point I wished to make was that the Government's response goes further than Sharman asked. Sharman said that we should follow the money for PFI <P>


<a name="column_876"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 876</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contractors. The Government believe we should follow the money for all contractors. The distinction I made was not about commercial confidentiality&#151;I do not think I used that phrase&#151;but applies where government money has to be returned to government or to the people of this country. In that case, we do need to follow the money. However, it would be an intrusion to follow and audit money where it goes as a right&#151;a pension, for example. That is the basis on which the protocols between the Government and the Comptroller and Auditor General are being made up. Those who are interested both in accounting efficiency and in civil liberties will respect those differences.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para0"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, says about the BBC. From time to time there is a review of the BBC Charter and no doubt representations can be made on that matter then. The view that we have taken is that the editorial independence of the BBC is of primary importance and we do not wish to put that at risk.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, as someone who spent 12 years on the Public Accounts Committee and who participated in the debates on the Bill three years ago when it went through the other place, I should like to congratulate the Government. They have actually provided more than we vigorously argued for on the Floor of the House of Commons. May I ask my noble friend about the accounting arrangements to the Public Accounts Committee in the other place? Under the present arrangements, the permanent secretaries effectively give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee. The Government's response refers to access orders on documents held by the bodies listed in the Sharman report. Can we presume from that that accounting officers, for want of a better term, or people who would be held responsible for accounts within those organisations&#151;which include the train operating companies, the PFI contractors and bodies with undertakings in receipt of grant&#151;may well find themselves giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in future, following the access orders to be introduced under these arrangements?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that I know the answer to that question. As far as I know, the issue was not covered by Sharman. It is a matter for the relationships between the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. No doubt there are people in the House of Commons who are much better informed than I am who could answer that point. I do not think that it is intrinsic to the issues raised by Sharman, although I acknowledge its importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister clarify the position on PFI contracts? We seem to be entering a new and different relationship for those contracts, which will play an increasingly important part in government funding. I think that the Minister will agree that the key to the PFI contract is a transfer of risk to the contractor. Some of the contractors will do well, some will do badly, some will <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do very well and some will do very badly. That is the nature of the market risk that the contractor is undertaking. While there is clearly a public interest in a degree of transparency, the contractor who is taking the risk is entitled to a degree of commercial confidentiality. If he has a successful contract and he is to be the subject of adverse comment at all times, as is the nature of these things, surely that will have the effect of shutting off contractors prepared to undertake PFI projects, who have freely entered into a commercial risk and accepted to take the rough with the smooth. The way that the Minister has explained the situation makes it seem as though the contractors may have to take the rough with the rough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord raises further important matters that are not covered by Sharman. The report recommended that PFI contractors should be subject to audit by the National Audit Office and to value for money studies. The Government accepted that view. Clearly, those who undertake contracts in public/private partnerships will take that risk. The principle that the Government have a responsibility to continue their investigations on where the money goes has been expounded all round the House this afternoon. That was the broad consensus expressed by the Sharman report, by the response to the report and by this House this afternoon.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool </B>   rose to call attention to trafficking in human beings, especially children; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, 1,500 years ago the Emperor Justinian commented on the phenomenon of human trafficking, which he said was spreading as profiteers took
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"advantage of poverty and inexperienced young girls".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para2"></a>
Justinian recorded practices that are used by traffickers even in our own times&#151;debt bondage, confiscation of earnings and denial of food and sleep.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para3"></a>In the 19th century, abolitionists such as Josephine Butler and W.T. Stead, who edited the Pall Mall Gazette, were at the forefront of campaigns to expose the false promises of jobs abroad, which too often concealed lives of servitude.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para4"></a> However, it would be wrong to think that trafficking in human beings is merely a thing of the past. In reality, the trade is a rapidly growing scourge that affects countries and families on every continent. On Monday this week I addressed a UK Anti-Trafficking Network conference, which was organised by WomenAid International. Organisations such as WomenAid International, Anti-Slavery International and the Jubilee Campaign are to be congratulated on the work that they have undertaken in drawing our attention to this most pressing and growing issue.
<P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para5"></a>Today's pre-legislative debate gives your Lordships a chance to consider the scale and nature of contemporary trafficking and what we might do about it. The Foreign Office, as well as the Home Office, will need to address some of the questions raised.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para6"></a>By way of background, last December, in answer to Questions that I tabled, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, set out the Government's constructive approach to reducing levels of trafficking in human beings, especially children. His absence today is because of family circumstances. We all regret that he is unable to be with us and we understand the reasons. I was also grateful for his promise to distinguish between trafficking and smuggling. To their credit, the Government have signed the trafficking protocol of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and have negotiated a European Union framework decision requiring criminalisation of trafficking where people are exploited for their labour and services or for sexual exploitation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para7"></a>As the UK will be required to implement this instrument within two years of its adoption, I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether it has been formally adopted. In their recent White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Haven, the Government indicated that they will use the forthcoming immigration Bill to introduce an offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. This will be a stopgap pending major legislative reform that will cover those being trafficked for both sexual and labour exploitation. The debate is therefore a timely opportunity to influence future legislation, but we shall need to do much more beyond our own shores.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para8"></a>Let me outline the sheer scale of the problem and why trafficking in human beings, particularly women and children, necessitates urgent and decisive action. Speaking at the conference earlier this week, Dr Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, described traffickers as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fishing in the stream of migration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para9"></a>
The catch in that stream has been growing inexorably. Research by ECPAT UK&#151;an organisation devoted to ending child prostitution, pornography and trafficking&#151;into the trafficking of children and research for the Home Office by the University of North London on the trafficking of women both provide conclusive evidence that, at an absolute minimum, hundreds of women and children are being trafficked into the UK each year.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para10"></a>A report in the Financial Times on 20th February stated that, according to the UN's Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in Vienna, human trafficking has become the fastest growing facet of organised crime. It is also incredibly lucrative. Powerful criminal organisations are estimated to earn a staggering &#163;4.3 billion a year from economic and sexual slavery. The trafficking of people is considered to be the third largest source of profits for organised crime, after the trafficking of drugs and firearms. Asian prostitutes in the United States can sell for <P>


<a name="column_879"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 879</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>20,000 dollars, while Russian women working in the brothels of Belgium are reported to bring in as much as 7,500 dollars a month, 7,000 dollars of which goes to their handler. On a visit to Moscow on behalf of Partners in Hope, of which I am a trustee, I heard a first-hand account of a boy who was sold for the price of a bottle of vodka.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para11"></a> Rebecca Bryan, the director of IREX, the United States-based International Research and Exchanges Board, estimates that 1.2 million people are trafficked each year worldwide, of whom at least 700,000 are women and children. The largest source of women for prostitution and the sex industry is Eastern Europe. According to the US State Department, more than 175,000 women are trafficked annually from the former eastern bloc countries, including Russia. The CIA reports that a least 50,000 of these women go to the US and that their average age is just 20. Victims come from Albania, Kosovo, Russia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, China, South-East Asia and West Africa.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para12"></a>Why are people trafficked? Some may be forcibly abducted and brought into the UK, but many victims put themselves or their children in the hands of traffickers to escape poverty and discrimination. That is particularly true in the case of women and children trafficked from the new independent states of the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe. They are promised well-paid jobs, education and marriage. Many women believe that they will be able to send money back to their families. In reality, they often end up exploited andabused in London and in our other major cities.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para13"></a>Escape is impossible. Traffickers often pay for the cost of their victims' passage into the UK. Travel costs are then inflated by charges for food, accommodation and interest on money borrowed from their traffickers. Burdened with debt and unable to secure legitimate employment, the victims are extremely vulnerable. If they refuse to submit to the traffickers' demands or attempt to escape, they may have their passports confiscated or be subjected to intimidation, violence, torture or rape. Traffickers also make threats of violence against friends and family as a way of ensuring that their victims keep working and do not try to escape.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para14"></a>Two years ago I visited the West African country of Benin and heard at first hand accounts of what was described to me as a modern slave trade. As Peter Brannen of the International Labour Office explained at Monday's conference, West African countries such as Benin and Nigeria are sending countries, receiving countries and transit countries. Ian Pannell of the BBC programme "PM" visited Nigeria and Turin to investigate how traffickers use the UK as a staging post&#151;a transit country&#151;for child prostitution to Italy.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para15"></a>The BBC says that many of the hundreds of girls sold into sexual slavery in Europe each year are trafficked through England. Ian Pannell interviewed Jane Osagie, who has worked with a number of <P>


<a name="column_880"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 880</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nigerian girls who have been trafficked. In a shocking interview&#151;only part of which I will quote in your Lordships' House&#151;she told the BBC:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A lot of them die . . . A lot don't come back. There were two girls who were trafficked and because they refused to go into the trade, they were banned from eating".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para16"></a><P>

<a name="20313-07_para17"></a> Others were refused drink. Clearly, that trade does not respect people or national borders and will require concerted international action to eliminate.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para18"></a>Girls from countries where trafficking is common arrive in the UK unaccompanied. Told to apply for asylum at the port of entry, the girls are placed into the care of the local social services department. Those girls subsequently disappear when their traffickers make contact with them and are never seen again by the authorities or their families.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para19"></a>Since 1995, 66 children who arrived unaccompanied in the UK have gone missing from West Sussex social services alone&#151;the majority in the past two years. In addition, last month two more girls went missing from West Sussex social services&#151;after the matter had been raised in your Lordships' House. Those children were supposed to be receiving care and protection. That is truly shocking and graphically illustrates the need for action.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para20"></a>In drawing attention to the problems in West Sussex&#151;where Gatwick airport provides the port of entry&#151;it is not my intention to single out that authority for particular criticism because at least it has tried to make some provision for victims and potential victims. It is probably because West Sussex has introduced a protocol and has proper victim profiling that its problems have come to light. One can only imagine the horrors that have yet to be unearthed in local authorities where no such protocol or provision is in place.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para21"></a>Government should require all area child protection committees to develop a protocol on trafficking. Social services and police authorities might then see a child as the victim of trafficking rather than as a 'lost asylum seeker' and act accordingly. The need for government to take a lead was underlined by the head of London's vice squad, Chief Superintendent Simon Humphrey. He complains that officers are unable to act effectively because of a lack of guidance and legislation. In the Evening Standard on 4th December 2001 he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Quite frankly we are getting our priorities wrong in this country. We care more about catching car criminals and people involved in consumer crime but we are doing nothing to help children who are being sexually exploited".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para22"></a>
Carol Howlett, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, recently argued that the prosecution of traffickers should became a key performance indicator target for chief constables in regions where trafficking is thought to be in place. I agree and hope that the Government will put that to chief constables.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para23"></a> It is incredible that the UK has no legislation that prohibits human trafficking. Police are using outdated legislation such as the Sexual Offences Act 1956. Even in the unlikely event of traffickers being caught, they receive prison sentences of not more than two years.
<P>


<a name="column_881"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 881</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para24"></a>Although the Government now recognise the need to legislate, for which I thank them, sadly the promised new Bill will not end labour exploitation. It should. The noble Lord, Lord Brett, who has considerable experience of the ILO, will doubtless have something to say about that aspect. I hope that the Government will give a clear assurance that the legislation will use the same definition of trafficking as adopted for both the 2001 European Union framework decision on trafficking and the 2000 United Nations protocol on trafficking. That will ensure international consistency in the definition of what constitutes an offence and that anyone involved in trafficking can be prosecuted regardless of whether they were involved in recruitment, transport or directly in the exploitation of that individual. That is a crucial point on which I shall welcome the Minister's response.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para25"></a>Having suggested how I would like to see the law on trafficking strengthened and internationalised, I want to put forward proposals for the treatment of victims. The White Paper states that victims of trafficking should be offered care and support&#151;but how is that to be done in practical terms? Care and support are crucial from the humanitarian perspective but without them, it will be impossible successfully to prosecute traffickers and disrupt their networks.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para26"></a>I have four proposals covering victim support, the prosecution of traffickers, protection and international co-operation. First, support services should be provided both to child and adult victims of trafficking. They should be referred to specialised services that can offer secure accommodation, information in a language they understand, medical or psychological assistance, legal assistance and the means to communicate with family back home. That is in line with the measures contained in Article 6 of the UN protocol on trafficking, to which the UK is a signatory.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para27"></a>Children need more truly safe houses. Funding will be needed for that and out-of-hours services&#151; particularly in areas where there are ports of entry. We should learn the lessons of West Sussex, good and bad. Adult victims should benefit from centrally funded specialised support services to which police, immigration and local authorities can make referrals.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para28"></a> Secondly, victims of trafficking should have a breathing space or "reflection delay", which would be in accordance with the European Commission's proposal for a short-term residence permit to victims of trafficking who assist the authorities in securing prosecutions. In Holland "reflection delay" lasts for three months. Six months would certainly be more appropriate in the case of children.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para29"></a>Thirdly, thought must be given to victim protection. Victims of trafficking who are returned home may be subject to violence, including torture and rape. Their families may also be threatened or attacked. Fear often silences victims. The Government will want to recognise their obligations under Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and under Article 3 of the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Treatment or Punishment&#151;under which no state party can expel, return or extradite a person where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be subjected to torture.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para30"></a>In looking at individual cases, I hope that the Government will consult with Anti-Slavery and others with expertise in trafficking and safety issues and will look at the American model for dealing with such cases, which I commend to the House.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para31"></a> Fourthly, we need to tackle the issue at source&#151;working with governments and non-governmental organisations in countries where trafficking occurs. Trafficking is a global problem that requires a global response. Doubtless we will hear from noble Lords about Sudan and other parts of the world where international leadership is desperately needed and the problem needs to be dealt with at source. Civil war, conflict, discrimination and poverty all play their part as people leave their homes and families to seek employment elsewhere. Rebecca Bryan from IREX declared:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At the most basic level . . . trafficking can be effectively combated only by generating employment at home and providing a viable alternative to girls and women desperately seeking a better life for themselves and their families".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para32"></a><P>

<a name="20313-07_para33"></a>Later in this debate we will hear from my noble friend Lord Wilberforce. His family name is synonymous with the enlightened humanitarian spirit that broke the slave trade in Britain and beyond. We will hear also from the noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids&#151;whose family was caught up in the misery of that same trade. What is human trafficking but a contemporary form of that age-old curse&#151;causing misery for the victims and their families and generating vast sums of money for the traffickers? It is an affront to human dignity and it is our duty to confront it. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Brett: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that I speak for all noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on the timely introduction of this important debate, which, almost uniquely, provides us with an opportunity for some scrutiny prior to the enactment of legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para34"></a>The noble Lord referred to my involvement. That has been at international level, with the International Labour Organisation. The growth of trafficking and exploitation of children for labour and other purposes captured international imagination to such an extent that in 1999&#151;the only time in its 80-year history of adopting conventions&#151;the ILO unanimously adopted a convention on extreme forms of child labour. At the top of the list of those forms of extreme child labour, of course, was child prostitution. There is, therefore, the political good will to see action take place.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para35"></a> That convention was accompanied by a well-established programme for the eradication of child labour, the IPEC programme, which has donated funds in excess of &#163;150 million over the past five to 10 years and which does sterling work in many parts of <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the world. Therefore, at international level we have a global report to the annual ILO conference on the fundamental rights of work, including freedom from forced labour and freedom from discrimination.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para36"></a>I have, therefore, observed with interest the record of our own Government over the past four years, with which I am very pleased. We were one of the earliest signatories to Convention 182 on extreme forms of child labour; we are, through DfID, a substantial financial supporter of the IPEC programme; and, with others, we welcome the White Paper to which reference was made earlier. The question is how we put into effect the international good will that we have. In my 10 years at the ILO I have noticed several deficiencies that appear to have permeated the international community and the UN system.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para37"></a>We have many good treaties. However, we often do not have coherence between them. We have many good intentions at national level. What we do not have at regional level&#151;in our case Europe&#151;is good co-ordination between member states. We quite often have good intentions, but do we have in place effective methods for prosecuting the perpetrators of these crimes? Finally, do we adequately understand the problems of the victims and do we know how to support them?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para38"></a>I certainly endorse all four points referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, particularly his reference to the need for victim support. It is a fact that victims who return to the member states from which they originated are again victimised, in many cases as a deterrent to others, in some cases out of sheer vindictiveness and in other cases to re-apply the same methods previously used as a commodity of labour, for sexual or other purposes, and to reintroduce those people to the illegal labour market.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para39"></a>The White Paper therefore provides us with a good opportunity to see what is present in outline and what we may want to see in detail, and I would urge on the Government the need to move forward this measure at the earliest opportunity for inclusion in the Queen's Speech. The international convention has now been in existence for three years. In this country, and in many others, we need adequately to translate into law effective methods to prosecute the perpetrators of trafficking.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para40"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said on 17th July that the Government were considering what needed to be done to form a non-governmental organisation to provide support and advice to the victims of trafficking&#151;a point referred to in the White Paper. Noble Lords will be pleased to know that that is an active consideration. However, it will, of course, need financial support. There is no point in creating an expectation unless we fully understand the problem and the need to deliver. I should therefore be grateful if the Government could confirm that they intend to provide financial support for the creation of such an organisation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, made an excellent point about a period of reflection for those who have been rescued from trafficking. People who find <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves in those difficult, isolated situations may experience great relief from the degradation that they have suffered, but they are not always able to make the wisest decisions at the time. Therefore, a period of reflection would appear to be in the best interests of the victims and something that can quite easily be achieved.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para42"></a>With regard to the question of non-sexual exploitation, child labour&#151;I am not referring to children delivering newspapers or to my daughters working part-time as waitresses in a golf club at 16&#151;it is true that there is in this country exploitation of children in full-time employment. It is well hymned. Many people will be shocked by the statistics quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that 66 children in one county&#151;admittedly that which contains Gatwick Airport&#151;have disappeared in five years. That is one of our problems.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para43"></a>Despite your Lordships' knowledge of the subject and the best efforts of all those who are involved&#151;I pay tribute particularly to Anti-Slavery for bringing forward this issue&#151;we in this country believe that this is a problem that happens elsewhere. We get some publicity for child prostitutes in Leeds or Manchester but we do not think that that is the same problem. We always find the excuse that it is a migration issue and therefore does not affect us. If this debate does nothing else, it should give us an opportunity to place on record that we in this country have a problem that we cannot wish away. Action has to be taken. I believe that the Government's intentions and efforts to date have been excellent. However, we now need speedy, carefully considered legislation, which hopefully will take account of your Lordships' contributions today.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para44"></a>I shall sit down two-thirds of the way through my allotted eight minutes, not only because of the excellent presentation by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, but in the sure knowledge that far more expert views than mine are to be expressed in the remainder of this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I warmly congratulate the noble Lord on initiating this debate, on introducing it so comprehensively and on his tireless endeavours on behalf of those suffering from violations of human rights in many parts of the world.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para45"></a>It was suggested that I should focus on Sudan. I appreciate the opportunity to highlight the human trafficking in the form of slavery there today. It is often said that abduction and trafficking in women and children in parts of Africa is not new. It has long been associated with inter-tribal conflict. But in Sudan a more systematic policy of abduction and enslavement of African women and children by Arabs from the north began in the 1980s. Then the Islamist National Islamic Front regime took power by military coup in 1989 and declared jihad in its most militaristic form against all who opposed it, including Muslims, traditional believers and Christians.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para46"></a>The objectives of the jihad include the forcible Islamisation of those not already Muslims and the Arabisation of the African peoples of the south and <P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nuba Mountains. The weapons of jihad include military offensives against innocent civilians and the manipulation of aid. The regime declared large areas as no-go zones for Operation Lifeline Sudan and associated aid organisations, so that its victims are left to suffer and die unreached, unhelped, unheard.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para47"></a>The third weapon of jihad is slavery, particularly in the borderlands such as northern and parts of southern Sudan, as in Bahr-el-Ghazal. In the early 1990s NIF leaders went to the borderlands to mobilise the local Arab tribesmen (murahaleen), to arm them and to encourage them to participate alongside government soldiers and jihad warriors in the raids on African communities in the south. They were told that they could keep the booty of war, including the human booty of women and children. That has been confirmed by Arabs from those areas who have spoken to us. The abducted women and children are used as slaves, boys as cattleherds, girls and women for domestic work and sexual exploitation, which results in irreversible genetic change for dignified Dinka people.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para48"></a>Abductions have been documented by the few aid organisations that defy the NIF's no-go ban and by independent media, including television programmes from "Dateline" in the mid-1990s to the BBC's "Everyman" last year, and newspapers ranging from Corriere Della Sera to the Ottawa Citizen. Reporters come, profoundly sceptical, and return convinced by the reality of slavery.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para49"></a>I and colleagues from Christian Solidarity Worldwide have been there, with the raids going on around us. We have seen communities decimated by the abduction of women and children and by a scorched earth policy. We have walked through miles of recently attacked villages, with countless human and cattle corpses, burnt homes, churches, mosques, animist shrines, schools, clinics&#151;total devastation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para50"></a>However, there are peaceable Arabs from the north, who are friends of the African Dinka people, who come south in the dry season to graze their cattle and to trade. At considerable risk, they identify, buy back and bring back slaves, for, if identified, they face penalties for undermining the jihad. They need money. They cannot just abduct slaves. Many local African communities can provide the necessary funds but others cannot because they have lost everything in the raids.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para51"></a>Therefore, we have provided resources for some communities to redeem slaves, for which we have been criticised. For example, it is said that we encourage the slave trade; that is not true. This trafficking is not economic&#151;the abduction is an act of war and will continue whether or not any slave is redeemed. Moreover, it has been said that we have been conned and that those whose freedom we buy are not slaves. But we meticulously check case histories of random samples of those returned. We also take other measures, such as double checking the translations of Dinka and Arabic interpreters.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para52"></a>Obviously, slave redemption is not the solution: the solution is to stop the slavery. International protest brought down apartheid, so why is there so much <P>


<a name="column_886"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 886</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reluctance to protest against slavery? Perhaps because David Hoile's well-funded organisation, the European-Sudanese Public Affairs Council, which acts as a mouthpiece for the NIF, widely disseminates publications full of misleading half-truths and references taken out of context, trying to discredit the evidence.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para53"></a>Moreover, the NIF does not allow independent organisations to visit the affected areas. Therefore, it is hard to obtain the evidence or to rescue those who have been abducted. The NIF's own face-saving mechanism, the Committee for the Eradication of the Abduction of Women and Children, has been extremely limited in its effectiveness. It does not rescue&#151;indeed, it cannot; they have gone beyond rescue&#151;those who have already been sold into slavery in other parts of Sudan or abroad; or boys, sent to the jihad training schools to be trained to fight against their own people. We have met some of those who have escaped and they have given us details.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para54"></a>Examples speak louder than generalisations. Kabissa Ayak, aged 28, was captured in a surprise attack on her village near Wonruk. The people ran in disarray. Her husband was killed. She tried to hide in a bush but was caught. In her own words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One of my sons aged 18 months was pounded to death in a pounding block, before my eyes. When I saw my husband dead and my child killed I tried to kill myself, so they bound me and dragged me along. We were taken to Muglad [in the North] . . . my owner's name is Hassan Hussein. I was enslaved for about 4 years, kept in a cattle compound and never given enough food. An Arab raped me and I became pregnant. I gave birth in a cattle compound with no help. I called the baby"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para55"></a>
whom we saw&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Mam' which means 'suffering' or 'difficulties' . . . I am a Christian and they tried to force me to become a Muslim . . . I thought about suicide because I had lost my loved ones and didn't want to go to the mosque. Then I heard rumours of traders who would return slaves and I managed to come out to meet them. I am still suffering because I lost my loved ones. But I want to say 'Thank you' for rescuing me from slavery".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para56"></a><P>

<a name="20313-07_para57"></a>In conclusion, I invite noble Lords to meet little Deng aged 10. He has just returned with a trader after spending two years as a slave. He is highly traumatised because he learnt that, in the raid during which he was captured, both his parents were killed. So he has returned to discover that he is an orphan. However, towards the end of our conversation, I got a wistful little smile from Deng. He said, "Well, at least I am home again now. I'm called by my own name Deng", which is Dinka for "rain", and rain is precious. It also means, "someone to be cherished" and a gift from God. He added, "I'm no longer called 'Abit', or slave".
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para58"></a> Everyone in your Lordships' House agrees that no child in the world today should be called "slave". I therefore ask the Minister what precisely Her Majesty's Government are doing to put more pressure on the National Islamic Front regime in the Sudan to change its policy so that no child will continue to be called "Abit" in the Sudan today.

<A NAME="20313-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, trafficking is not a new crime. <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, it is acquiring a salience that demands urgent response. We are grateful to the noble Lord for introducing this debate at this time, in advance of legislation by the Government. I am also grateful to the Government for showing, domestically, a degree of urgency and sensitivity to concerns that have properly been expressed about the inadequacy of our domestic law.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para59"></a>However, because I can only endorse and underline what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, so eloquently said about the position within the United Kingdom, I shall focus my remarks on the efforts that might be made and, I believe, are being made by other countries in Europe, particularly in that part of Europe that has been afflicted by the fall-out from the conflicts in south eastern Europe and the ending of the regimes behind the Iron Curtain. In those areas the problems are transnational and complex. They require international co-operation and multi-agency approaches.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para60"></a> There is a very marked rise in the number of victims of trafficking coming to western Europe from eastern Europe. A great deal of evidence, not just anecdotal, shows that there is an enormous increase in the involvement of organised crime with substantial profits being made from trafficking. The Stability Pact Task Force on trafficking has sought to co-ordinate activities and to facilitate communication between all the relevant organisations. This has been achieved with practical consequences on the ground&#151;sometimes operating with bodies like the International Organisation for Migration, as in Albania&#151;by providing safe houses, witness protection programmes, and strengthening co-operation with the police to enhance victim protection.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para61"></a>When the matter was the subject of an exchange between the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, I detected some indication that there is a lack of certainty about the full scale of the problem. It is impossible to argue that the problem is not growing, and doing so at an alarming rate. It may be impossible to produce accurate statistics for very obvious reasons: those who are victims are very unwilling to come forward to provide information. But the illustrative estimates that have been produced by Europol are, I believe, helpful. On the basis of submissions from member countries, they indicate that, for example, one group operating in the Netherlands with control over 10 women was earning about 3,500 euros a day.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para62"></a>Attention has also been drawn to the estimate from the Institute of Migration that 500,000 women have illegally been moved from the Ukraine to western Europe in the 10 years since independence. It is estimated that one in five of those women is trapped, or has been trapped, in the illegal sex industry.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para63"></a>It is right to consider what are called the "push and pull" factors&#151;the origins in economic and social deprivation&#151;and to recognise that some of those who are involved are coming to the West willingly because they imagine that their lives will be better as a result. In order to deal with that fact, we have to look at our own immigration policies and acknowledge with cool <P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and calculating judgment that this country could accept many more skilled and, indeed, unskilled immigrants. If others were to follow that lead, some of the pressure in those countries on exposed and endangered women could be substantially reduced.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para64"></a>The other main cause of the problem is the conflict in those parts of the world and the subsequent fall-out. However, I believe that the international community is responding to that, notably through the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights based in Warsaw under the OSCE. The organisation has done much to advance the debate about the nature of the requirements of proper legislation against trafficking in all the member countries. It has produced invaluable work, which we should seek to disseminate and follow up.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para65"></a>The ODIHR has promoted important fieldwork, in which the Government have played a useful role. The Government not only contributed to the anti-trafficking fund, they were an originator of it. In addition, the ODHIR has provided anti-trafficking hotlines offering information and counselling in the Ukraine and Belarus, and raising awareness through, for example, a five-part programme in Russia to highlight the risks posed to women by traffickers. It has also set up programmes for the return to Poland and re-integration there of victims of trafficking, which were supported by the anti-trafficking fund. Those useful measures, which have practical consequences, must be considered with at least as much urgency as the need to change the law.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para66"></a>The political determination by member governments of OSCE not to tolerate such activity is as important as the adherence to anti-trafficking conventions. Pressure in regard to those points can produce results. For example, there is evidence that when, during the negotiation of a stability pact with Albania, the Albanian government were taken up on the matter, they appointed a co-ordinator to take account of trafficking in human beings.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para67"></a>The Government are doing valuable work in such forums. We in western Europe must take responsibility for the matter, and, notwithstanding the complexity of delivering the results, make a serious commitment to deal with it. When we view the Government's domestic legislation on trafficking, we shall bear in mind that it must deal not only with the repression of the offences but, in particular, with the protection of the human rights of the victims.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew9"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Bristol: </B>   My Lords, I join other contributors in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, for introducing this timely debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para68"></a>We are slowly waking up to the seriousness of the challenge posed by the trafficking in human beings. In Bristol we have in recent years begun to work through the history of slavery, often painfully. We discovered that slavery took place not only in the 17th and 18th centuries on the North Atlantic triangular route, but also that it was present in the 11th century, when young men and pregnant maidens from Wiltshire were <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sold to the Viking Irish. We asked, sometimes with incredulity, how it was possible for human beings to act in that way, treating their brothers and sisters as commodities to be bought and sold when the price was right. How, especially, could children be born into slavery and grow up knowing no other life? We need to be clear that the issue is not a racial one; it has to do with the value of human beings and human dignity, and it is therefore for the consideration of us all.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para69"></a> We have recognised only recently that a new form of that evil trade continues and is growing rapidly. In the nature of the case, precise numbers are not known with certainty. I hope that the Minister will be able to indicate the Government's assessment of the numbers involved and the measures that recently they said they were taking to improve levels of information. I am sure that nobody will publicly defend this vile trade. The question is: what is to be done to address the problem? There is, as noble Lords said, no shortage of conventions, protocols and agreements, prepared by the United Nations and its agencies or agreed by the European Union. Trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation are recognised internationally as significant problems with transnational dimensions. Member states have been urged to address the problem as a matter of urgency.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para70"></a>I therefore welcome the steps that the Government have already taken to show their awareness of the need for action. The Church of England Board for Social Responsibility noted in its response last year to Setting the Boundaries, the sex offences review, that the Josephine Butler Society had asked for its support on the issue of trafficking and sexual exploitation. The society hoped that an organisation would be established to help the victims of trafficking with a multi-agency approach. We need to deal with the matter in the spirit of Josephine Butler, with her fearless unmasking of hypocrisy, her energy and her concern for some of the most vulnerable and wretched people in society.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para71"></a>I welcome also the Government's statement in the asylum and immigration White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Haven, of their intention to implement recommendation 49 of the sex offences review by introducing a specific offence of trafficking, with powers given to trace assets overseas. The noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, has drawn particular attention to children. I hope that the Minister will also be able to assure us that the legislation will reflect the seriousness of those crimes against children. I support the Children's Society and other children's organisations in their calls for action on Recommendations 50 and 51 of the sex offences review, which proposed the introduction of specific offences relating to the commercial exploitation of children. As I said, that will require a multi-agency approach, and resources will be needed. That means that we must decide whether we think that the matter is important enough.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para72"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, said in his fourth point that the issue is an international one. Perhaps, therefore, we must tackle it at source. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for the way <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in which she introduced the issues relating to Africa, not least the Sudan. I shall underline what she said: Mauritania and the Sudan are the places in Africa where the greatest numbers are involved in the modern, 21st century slave trade. I have been much indebted to Ronald Segal, who wrote a book on the Atlantic slave trade and his latest, in 2001, on Islamic black slaves. He supports greatly the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. It is a country divided, north and south, Christian and Muslim. It is about Arabisation, and it continues in that way. I shall support the point with figures: in December 1999 alone, 5,514 slaves were redeemed at the cost of &#163;35 each. It is interesting that in the 2nd century AD the Christian Church in Europe decided that it too had to be involved in the remitting of slaves, and this is a continuation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para73"></a>We are right to condemn this evil trade and to do all that is possible in our own country to wipe it out. However, it is about globalisation and our responsibility to challenge and tackle countries where the trade originates. So perhaps we have to send to the Sudans of this world, and maybe to other nations as well, a challenge to Islam, as we were challenged as Christians in the 17th and 18th century about the values, and the name, in which slavery is undertaken; to challenge democratic governments, ourselves included, that our own values are neither safe nor sound if we deal with these matters in isolation; to challenge the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is so blatantly flouted; and to challenge ourselves that the situation is redeemable.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para74"></a>If we are to call to mind a memory, let us think of what happened in South Africa. The evil of apartheid continued despite the words of the United Nations and of governments. It was only when popular pressure, when human beings recognised that the issue was about their brothers and sisters, when enforced measures were introduced banning arms, oil and financial credit, that the retreat from apartheid began; and in 1994 a non-racial democracy in South Africa began.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para75"></a>It is right for the Government and your Lordships' House to take action. But we must raise the consciousness of the people not only of this country, but also of other countries, to the belief that these issues have to be tackled because it is an affront to our human dignity that this trade continues. Only then will governments begin to listen, and things be changed.

This indeed is a very worrying trend which seems to be escalating despite the many efforts to discourage such a disgraceful trade.

<P>

<a name="20313-07_para77"></a>The purpose of the slave trading of my ancestors and now is for gain, greed and gratification. Let me explain. Centuries ago there were, here in Europe, many nations with varying systems of government and they were made up of farmers, craftsmen, artists, musicians, priests, soldiers, teachers, kings and queens. They were people who were husbands and wives, daughters and sons, nephews, nieces, grandparents and grandchildren. They were human.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para78"></a> At the same time there were in Africa many nations with varying systems of government made up of farmers, craftsmen, and so forth. They too were husbands and wives, daughters and sons, nephews, nieces, grandparents and grandchildren. They were human. It was not a case of "nations" in Europe and "tribes" in Africa. Both could be described as either nations or tribes.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para79"></a>But Europeans travelled to Africa. They violently assaulted the Africans in their own homes. They shackled them in leg irons and transported them in insanitary conditions of disease and malnutrition thousands of miles across the sea to the Caribbean and the Americas. There they were sold by auction to other Europeans for whom they had to work without payment on sugar and cotton plantations and at any task or in any conditions inflicted upon them. That was not enough. They also had to gratify the slave owners in their beds.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para80"></a>The Africans who rebelled against that treatment were beaten, humiliated and sometimes killed. Rebellions were put down with the utmost savagery while the European plantation owners became richer and richer from the unpaid labour of Africans.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para81"></a> The primary driving force behind the European dehumanising of Africans was the acquisition of wealth. There was money to be made from buying and selling Africans and from their unpaid labour&#151;wealth for individuals and families in Britain. Cities in Britain and the British economy benefited greatly from that trade. Years later Sir Winston Churchill said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The West Indies, two hundred years ago, ranked very largely in the minds of all people who were making Britain and the British by the wealth they supplied to Britain".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para82"></a><P>

<a name="20313-07_para83"></a>As more and more weapons of mass destruction become available to more and more people, the search for peaceful co-existence among the peoples of this shrinking planet becomes even more urgent. Feelings of superiority, inferiority and resentment can slide into aggression and violence, and that threatens the only basis there is for peaceful co-existence; namely, a mutual respect in which we see everyone else as our equal. Without that there is no hope for any of us. It is therefore imperative that we identify whatever might give rise to mistaken ideas of superiority and inferiority in order to destroy their poison.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para84"></a> Although Africans had always resisted their enslavement and their rebellions were making the plantations less profitable and increasingly unmanageable, there was still great opposition in Britain to any change. However, in 1793 a small but determined group mounted a campaign which finally <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieved the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. I understand that at the heart of that movement were a group of Christians gathered around the Reverend John Venner, Rector of Holy Trinity, Clapham, and they included persons prominent in public life such as Wilberforce, Clarkson, Sharpe, Buxton, Thornton, Stephen, Macauley and others.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para85"></a>They drew upon evidence and experiences supplied by a remarkable African who had himself been sold into slavery. Oluadah Equiano was that slave. Eventually their efforts were rewarded when the British Parliament outlawed the slave trade in 1807 and slavery itself in 1833. A sad note in all of that was that, whereas compensation of more than &#163;1 million was paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves, nothing was paid to the survivors of the 20 million Africans who had been enslaved by them. Great changes can be brought about by small beginnings when a cause is just.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para86"></a>A paradox of this despicable epoch of human history is that it has also been the occasion for an almost superhuman act of forgiveness. The rape and pillage of Africa have so far not been followed by any vengeful atrocities against vulnerable Europeans. On the contrary, the recent peaceful transition from apartheid South Africa to democratic South Africa is but a particular example of a general African sense of generosity and forgiveness. Similarly, the modern Caribbean is a microcosm of what the world could be like where, in the aftermath of slavery and colonialism, people of every ethnic group can have the freedom to be who they are.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para87"></a>I have been trying to impress upon noble Lords that the appalling act of enslavement must never be forgotten and needs to be recorded so that trade in humans should never be tolerated again. Poets like Homer recognised that need, and the horror that descendants have felt at the thought of the annihilation of Africans should give us courage to carry on with the quest lest it be said by the spirits of our ancestors, "We lost heart and we forgot the task".
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para88"></a>Today, as I remind your Lordships' House of our combined history&#151;when the continent of Africa saw its children abused, treated as less than human, degraded and humiliated in ways which led the African, in his chains and being whipped, to ask the question, "Am I not a brother?"&#151;I should like to join other noble Lords in the task of not only highlighting the plight of the victims of present-day slavery but of ensuring that human rights are at the core of any anti-trafficking strategy.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para89"></a>I realise that I have gone past my time; I shall hurry. We do not often recognise it, but some of the problems that we deal with daily in Britain arise from that legacy, which has been described by other noble Lords as "degrading". The traumas of slavery run deep and could blight future generations. I therefore ask Her Majesty's Government to support the four proposals outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. A memorial to the unknown slave would not go amiss in our country as it would highlight the fact that we are against slavery.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids, and her moving historical survey.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para90"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Alton for the comprehensive way in which he introduced the debate. He will know that I come to it from the experience of working to prevent, first, the exploitation of domestic workers coming to Britain from overseas; and, secondly, the exploitation of children in poor countries for the purposes of sex tourism.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para91"></a>Both kinds of exploitation stem from extreme poverty in certain countries and, in particular, from rural poverty. Trafficking in people usually involves deception in the country of origin and coercion or debt bondage in the country of destination. This abuse would be less widespread without the poverty of those being trafficked.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para92"></a>It is well known that Russian, Ukrainian and Albanian organised crime gangs are exploiting both young women and street children. The Republics of Moldova and Romania are countries of origin and also countries of transit. I have visited both and I know that between half a million and a million Moldovans are obliged by economic poverty to seek work abroad. Some end up trapped in prostitution, in Italy and elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para93"></a>In Romania, a journalist friend of mine plans a thorough study of trafficking. He confirms that poverty and unemployment are its root causes. People lack solid information and are easily seduced by stories about the glamour of the rich west. In Romania, the legislation on trafficking is not very effective, although there is some police co-operation with Interpol.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para94"></a>I thank successive governments for what they have done to improve the situation of domestic workers from overseas now in Britain. Their efforts to curb sex tourism and paedophilia by British residents are good and have had notable support from the Thompson travel organisation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para95"></a>There are several practical steps that the Government could take to prevent trafficking. They could, for instance, remove reservations from the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This would benefit children who have reached this country and then been taken into care by local authorities. They should ratify the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. They should ensure that trafficking is defined in future legislation, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, in the same way as in the protocol to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and the EU framework decision on trafficking.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para96"></a>A new Bill was promised last May. When will the Government publish it? When will it be introduced? I trust that the minimum penalty for trafficking will be no less than six or seven years' imprisonment, with a much higher maximum for cases involving prostitution and child abuse, together with the confiscation of the proceeds of trafficking.
<P>


<a name="column_894"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 894</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para97"></a>Much also should be done without legislation. Will the Government propose that the European Union and the ODIHR should provide full information, in Eastern Europe and other countries of origin, on the policy against trafficking; on the dangers of deception and bogus job offers; and also on bona fide work opportunities that exist or could be created in Western Europe?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para98"></a>At home, will the Government allow victims of trafficking to remain here if they are willing to give evidence? I believe that that is already the intention, but it may need better witness protection. Exceptional leave to remain may also be needed in some cases to protect both the victims and their relatives in the country of origin. A delay for reflection to allow victims to decide calmly on their next steps can be critically important. I believe that the Netherlands allows three months in such cases. Can we do the same here? I hope so.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para99"></a>Secure accommodation for victims of trafficking has been mentioned. In my view, it is urgently needed. Medical and legal help should go along with this. Will the Government fund a specialist NGO to fill this gap? The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who is not in his place, spoke about this issue on 17th July, as did the noble Lord, Lord Brett, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol today. What is being done now?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para100"></a>The problems we are discussing reinforce the importance of dealing with poverty at source. In Europe, this means European Union enlargement, the South-East Europe Stability Pact, the PHAR and TACIS programmes, and micro-finance in generating additional works and jobs in countries of origin. In Britain, the corollary is ever-increasing co-operation between departments&#151;for example, Immigration, Customs and Excise, Inland Revenue, police and social services. I know that the Foreign Office is well aware of this, is encouraging it and is spreading the word abroad. But has the message of co-operation been fully received at home?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para101"></a> To end on a positive note, I congratulate the Government on the successes attained through Project Reflex. I believe that there have been 37 arrests and 13 convictions of traffickers.

<A NAME="20313-07_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on securing this timely debate which highlights a widespread and persistent horror&#151;the trafficking in human life. This abhorrent practice is no less than a modern form of slavery.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para102"></a>From children trafficked to work as forced labour in the cocoa industry of west Africa to child camel jockeys as young as four trafficked from the Sudan to the Gulf states and girls trafficked across Asia into sexual servitude, this is a boom trade which we are nowhere near to eradicating.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para103"></a>We may like to think that this is not an evil which stains European soil. As we have heard today, we would be wrong. Inconceivable though it is in the 21st century, trafficking in human beings is taking place all over the world, in developed and developing countries <P>


<a name="column_895"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>alike, in countries where human rights are routinely violated and in countries where human rights are respected. This is a truly global plague, the victims of which can find themselves in London or Paris as well as Bangkok or Manila. The OSCE has warned that trafficking affects all its member states, either as countries of origin, countries of transit or countries of destination.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para104"></a>To pick up on the point made by the right reverend Prelate, globalisation has had a mixed effect on the invidious practice of trafficking. On the one hand, it has a beneficial effect. New communication technologies are enabling information to flow more and more freely. As a result, there are now fewer dark corners in the world in which the perpetrators of this evil crime can hide.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para105"></a>However, the wider availability of information is proving to be a double-edged sword. The Internet is being misused for the purpose of promoting sexual exploitation; and a sinister triangle has developed between globalisation, cross-border trafficking in human life and weaknesses in national immigration policies. The net result is that this trade is allowed not only to exist but to flourish and expand.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para106"></a>Faced with a growing body of evidence, the spotlight of international attention is now beginning to focus more sharply on trafficking. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which supplements the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised crime, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in November 2000. This is an important new tool to facilitate international co-operation. Last month, the European Union adopted a comprehensive action plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in the European Union.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para107"></a>NGOs have also sought to turn up the heat on traffickers. In November 2001, Anti-Slavery launched a two-year campaign against human trafficking: to draw attention to it; and to lobby for national and international policy changes to penalise traffickers, protect trafficked people's rights and address the root causes. It should be praised in this work.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para108"></a>Individually and collectively, states bear primary responsibility for the implementation of measures to combat trafficking; but this is a trans- national problem which no country alone can tackle. Trafficking is a complicated and multi- faceted problem which requires a co-ordinated, interdisciplinary and international response.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para109"></a>Current legal frameworks, policies and strategies have to date proved inadequate either to prevent trafficking and prosecute traffickers or to protect the human rights of the trafficked. Co-ordination, at both national and international level, has been the exception rather than the rule. As a result, the victims of trafficking are often treated as criminals, while the traffickers go unpunished.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para110"></a>We have heard evidence of how hundreds of women and children, from China to Kosovo, from Africa to Asia, and from Lithuania to Nigeria, are being <P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trafficked through and into the United Kingdom. We have heard how these girls are told to apply for asylum at the ports, and are then referred to social services but disappear when the traffickers make contact with them. We have heard how, since 1995, 66 children have gone missing from West Sussex social services in this way.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para111"></a>For some time it has been clear that there is an urgent need to adopt legislation which concretely criminalises trafficking in human beings and to give priority to combating this pernicious and odious form of slavery. The UK has no specific legislation prohibiting human trafficking, and law enforcement bodies are hampered in their efforts to tackle this scourge because of lack of guidance.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para112"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, legislation that is nearly 50 years old, such as the Sexual Offences Act 1956, is being applied which provides for maximum sentences of only two years. While the UK is a signatory to the UN protocol on the prevention and suppression of trafficking and the EU framework decision on trafficking for the purposes of sexual and labour exploitation, domestic legislation is needed to give effect to them. I therefore welcome the Government's recent immigration and asylum White Paper, which includes a commitment to legislate in this area and to increase the penalties for those involved in trafficking. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, remarked, it is rare to have such an opportunity in advance of legislation to make constructive suggestions on the framing of new laws, and that is most welcome.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para113"></a>This is an important opportunity for the Government to send a strong message world-wide that they are serious about fighting traffickers; and secondly, to ensure statutory protection for victims of trafficking in the United Kingdom. I hope that any new legislation will form the backbone to a tripartite approach&#151;policies and programmes aimed at the prevention of trafficking, the protection of the victims and the prosecution of the perpetrators.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para114"></a>It is important, as the noble Lord, Lord Brett, pointed out, that the new legislation clearly distinguishes trafficking from smuggling. Will the Minister give an assurance that the legislation will use the same definition of trafficking as has been adopted in both the EU framework decision on trafficking and the UN protocol on trafficking, so that there is much-needed consistency in the definition of the offence of trafficking? If the state intervenes at all, it is usually the victims who are arrested and deported, while the traffickers continue to operate with near impunity.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para115"></a>Few victims&#151;in the destination countries or upon return to their country of origin&#151;receive any assistance, protection or legal remedy against their traffickers. As the noble Lord, Lord Brett, mentioned, the victims of trafficking who are returned home may face torture, rape, detention or even death at the hands of the traffickers.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para116"></a>When we treat the symptoms, we must at the same time look to the root causes; namely, poverty and corruption. International action to address slavery and trafficking will not be successful unless it tackles <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these root causes. Poverty breeds abusive labour practices. Poverty and the exploitation of desperation is at the heart of bonded labour. Poverty, which particularly affects women, is at the heart of the exploitation of women. The poverty of parents is at the heart of their decision to sell their children. The victims of slavery-like abuses are generally from the poorest and the most vulnerable social groups. The cancer of slavery is a symptom of the malignancy of poverty, and the two must be treated together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Wilberforce: </B>   My Lords, let us make no mistake. This debate is, literally and firmly, about slavery, as many speakers have said. It is true, if perhaps a little facile, to say that slavery has not been abolished; it has simply been modernised by the demographic changes that have taken place and by economic forces. France&#151;a wise and logical country&#151;has recognised this by setting up a committee under the appropriate name, Le Comit&#233; Contre L'Esclavage Moderne&#151; the committee against modern slavery. We ought to recognise trafficking for what it is.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para117"></a>We have been given a great many estimates of the numbers involved. I endorse the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and venture to agree with him that evidence as to the scale of the problem is uncontested. It is not confined to a number of well-known groups or a number of well-known countries as the old slave trade was. It is perhaps more difficult, therefore, to get to grips with it. Nor is it limited to a definite and recognisable status in terms of the persons concerned. Anyone can recognise a slave; it is not so easy to recognise a victim of trafficking. As a consequence, the organisation Anti-Slavery International, of which I have the honour to be president, has taken the matter very seriously. It has conducted inquiries, attended meetings and is working very actively indeed on the basis that trafficking is a modern form of slavery.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para118"></a>I want to make two preliminary points before coming to my argument. First, there are plenty of case notes, some of which we have heard in the debate. I shall not add to them, except to recall a rather moving occasion at which I was present, with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, when an award was made by Anti-Slavery International. Two young Bangladeshi girls, Roushan and Golan, aged about 13, spoke to the meeting about their experiences. They recounted how they were trafficked at the age of about 12 or younger for sums of six US dollars in one case and 13 US dollars in the other. They recounted their experiences, and they were able to say what has happened to them since then and since they have been taken in for rehabilitation by the Association for Community Development. It was therefore moving in two respects: first, the fact of the trafficking; and, secondly, the equally important fact that something can be done and&#151;as I think we all agree&#151;must be done to rehabilitate those who have been through the process.
<P>


<a name="column_898"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 898</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para119"></a>The second preliminary point is very short. It is simply to endorse what has been said: there are plenty of international instruments dealing with this matter. They have been listed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol and others, and they include the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation, and now the European Community. I am glad to say that this country has a good record of joining in with those instruments, and no doubt we will be active in carrying into effect the European Union framework communication.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para120"></a> I shall concentrate on three points which are perhaps relevant to the practical implementation of those many international instruments. The first, of course, is the question of definition. It sounds like a dry legal point, but I think that it is rather more important than that. Trafficking is a vague word. Although it has become a term of art which everyone involved in the affair knows and understands, it is not so easy when one tries to analyse it and see what it includes. The United Nations protocol has therefore given a much more elaborate definition focusing on the word exploitation, which is said to include as a minimum sexual exploitation, forced labour and so on. The definition brings out some interesting and important points. This trafficking is not limited to sexual exploitation, although those cases catch the headlines, but involves all sorts of forced labour, exposure to hazardous work and even the involuntary enlistment of soldiers in military service. There are said to be 300,000 such soldiers.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para121"></a>We now have this rather comprehensive definition, although the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has twice given a rather cautious reply about its incorporation in British law. I completely understand that, and the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, may do the same. It is a rather wide definition and perhaps needs to be refined. However, I understood from the noble Lord, Lord Rooker&#151;perhaps the Minister who is to reply to this debate will be able to confirm it&#151;that this definition is acceptable and must be made part of the law in the interests of police trying to enforce it and welfare organisations trying to implement it, and of the general public who need to understand what it involves.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para122"></a>The second point is police reinforcement, about which much has been said. There is a low rate of conviction. Very often as a rule, victims will not give evidence. There is also big money on the other side. Moreover, the area is a very difficult one and includes a great number of countries in eastern Europe, West Africa and elsewhere. There are problems with language, and problems about visas and passports which are falsified and may enable people to come in illegally. The ambassador in the Cote d'Ivoire has said that there is evidence there of many children's visas being false. That brings us to what has already been described as the difficult case of unaccompanied children, of whom there are said to be 10,000 in this country.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para123"></a>Additionally, when one is considering how to deal with a particular problem, one is faced with human rights problems. Mrs Mary Robinson, the United <P>


<a name="column_899"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 899</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nations High Commissioner, is on record as saying that human rights should be at the centre of this problem, and that this problem should be at the centre of human rights. However, one still has to ask who is to take up the human rights aspect of the problem and see to it that effect is given to human rights. Then we have the final problem. When one has identified a case and brought about a prosecution, what is one to do with the victims? It is not enough to send someone to prison; that is the least important and interesting side of it. What is one to do with the victims, who very often are women and children with all sorts of problems of their own at home?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para124"></a>All of this is very much beyond the resources of the ordinary police force which is not used to doing this sort of work. It has probably never heard of trafficking. We have the evidence of Kelly and Regan, researchers who have given excellent help to the Home Office. They say that the majority of police forces have little knowledge of the problem. So, there must be a specialised unit, either a police force or mixed force, which is expert at dealing with it. It is not enough to have even a sufficient number of policemen expert in it. We had a meeting with ECPAT the other day, and we were told that there were only 12 trained policemen capable of dealing with this problem. That is a serious figure that we have to bear in mind.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para125"></a>So there is a problem of police enforcement. I was going to go on to say something about the problem of rehabilitation, but I see that my time has expired. Other speakers have spoken of it. I think that we are behind other countries in what we do in the way of rehabilitation. We need money to enable refuges to be set up, to which victims, particularly young children, can be sent before they are sent back. We also have the problem of giving evidence about their condition, and the Dutch experiment of three-months' respite before action is taken.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para126"></a>I cannot do more now than conclude by heartily endorsing and thanking the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for the splendid way in which he has brought this subject to our attention.

Only last week, the Government produced a very interesting video on forced marriages and abduction. I commend the video to noble Lords and urge them to watch it.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para127"></a>In the past few years, I have travelled to various European countries and to various parts of the Middle East and Africa. Trafficking in women and children is a common factor affecting many of those countries. My own involvement with the Save the Children Fund has confirmed the alarming scale of the problem in the Far East as well. The problem has an international dimension and is literally out of control.

<FONT SIZE=3>trade were beheaded. No one could fail to be moved by the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids. What we have done is to move from chains and shackles to blackmail and corruption, which are some of the factors now oppressing women and children who are least able to defend themselves.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para129"></a>Although no accurate statistics are available on the number of people being trafficked internationally, it is clear that this contemporary form of slavery is affecting hundreds of thousands of people each year. I contacted Anti-Slavery International, and it believes that, every year, at an absolute minimum, hundreds of women and children are being trafficked to the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation. It also believes that the situation is getting worse. That view is shared by the deputy director of Europol, who recently said that human trafficking to EU member states for sexual exploitation and illicit labour is increasing significantly.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para130"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, provided statistics on the number of foreign nationals, including children, who have been lost from the system. That is a frightening thought. Many of these young people have escaped from care and into the hands of those who exploit them. They face frightening consequences. Not only are they blackmailed to perform various tasks, but their families abroad are being blackmailed to ensure that they do not complain about their treatment here or elsewhere in the European Union. Evidence from law enforcement officials indicates two new and worrying trends. First, the victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation are getting younger and more children are involved. Secondly, there are increasing links with organised crime, with those responsible for trafficking in people also being involved with drugs and arms trafficking. Those factors make tackling trafficking an even greater priority for governments everywhere.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para131"></a>The right reverend Prelate was right to draw attention to the UK Government's proposal in the White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Haven, to bring forward a stopgap measure in the Bill dealing with immigration to introduce an offence of trafficking with a maximum penalty of 14 years. That is a positive step to end the current situation where no offence for trafficking exists, thereby making it a high-profit and low-risk crime. The commitment in the White Paper to bring in detailed legislation to cover people trafficking for both sexual and labour exploitation "as soon as possible" is also welcome. I hope that the Government will hasten that legislation. I believe that the next Queen's Speech should bring forward a definition of "trafficking" to be used in domestic legislation. Such a definition should mirror that used in the UN protocol on trafficking and the EU framework decision on trafficking which is currently still under discussion. Using the same definition will ensure consistency in terms of what constitutes an offence of trafficking in people, both within the European Union and internationally.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para132"></a>I also welcome the acknowledgement in the White Paper that victims of trafficking should be offered the care and support that many noble Lords have <P>


<a name="column_901"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 901</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mentioned. But the Government need to go further and detail the specific measures that they will take to ensure the protection and support of victims of trafficking in the United Kingdom. Victims' protection should be at the centre of an anti-trafficking policy and the system in the UK is clearly inadequate. Currently, for example, there is no agency to which the police, immigration, local authorities or non-governmental agencies can refer adult victims of trafficking where they can receive specialised support services and advice, including secure accommodation. My own authority, West Sussex social services, is the only body to provide such services for children. It is absolutely essential that the Government fund the provision of secure accommodation and assistance for victims of trafficking as a matter of urgent priority.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para133"></a>It is also important that victims of trafficking should have a breathing space that will give them the opportunity to receive assistance from such a specialised agency and to make an informed decision about whether they wish to co-operate with authorities in prosecuting the traffickers. Such a system already exists in other European countries like Holland, Belgium and Italy, as has been pointed out. That breathing space will give support workers the chance to gain victims' confidence and to assist them to recover from their traumatic experiences. During that process, information regarding how they were recruited and transported will come to light, so that even if the victim decides not to testify against the traffickers, the authorities will still have vital information about the traffickers' modus operandi that will allow them to profile possible victims and to disrupt the traffickers' networks.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para134"></a>In that context, I draw your Lordships' attention to the model that has been used in Italy, which has much to recommend it. Under Italian law a special permit to stay can be issued when,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"situations of violence or grave exploitation towards a foreigner have been identified, and concrete dangers for his or her safety emerged as a result of the intent to withdraw from the circle".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para135"></a>
The permit is valid for six months and is renewable for one year, with the possibility that victims may be allowed to remain permanently. Both the police and non-governmental organisations can apply for the permit and the issuing of permits is not made contingent on the victim collaborating in a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para136"></a>According to a senior expert for social policy in the Italian ministry of manpower, that system has helped to ensure more co-operation with the authorities because victims feel more secure and, therefore, prosecutors support the use of the special residency permits. According to information supplied by the National Anti-Mafia Directorate, currently there are 1,682 investigations or prosecutions under way against traffickers in Italy. Given that that system has proved effective in terms of protecting and supporting the victims and in ensuring effective prosecutions of the traffickers, I hope that the Minister will assure the House that the Government will give serious consideration to operating such a system in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, human trafficking is human suffering of the most extreme kind. On my journeys abroad I have seen a 12 year-old girl, carrying a baby, sold into prostitution; six, seven and eight year-old children in labour conditions that are appalling, working 12 or 14 hours a day; and in Columbia a 10 year-old taken from his family by guerrillas to be trained as one of their soldiers. Such suffering, which is the product of the crime of trafficking, demands a message of clarity from this House.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para137"></a>The trafficked must be given sanctuary. Those who traffic must be the subject of firm law and condign punishment. The problem of trafficking must be recognised in our society as being of the highest significance and demanding action by us all. First, those who are enslaved look for refuge, somewhere to go to escape. I ask rhetorically, in our society do we have a system that provides such refuge? I regret that the answer is no.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para138"></a>If there is refuge, the trafficked want security against those who exploit them. The blackmail of which we have heard is not financial in essence, but fear against the person&#151;woman or child, or their families in the country from which they have been trafficked. Without that reassurance, that security, they will not look for refuge. If given refuge, if reassured, they want to know that those from whom they have sought help will not treat them as an asylum cipher, a problem to be disposed of in the most rapid and cost-effective way. They need to know whether they will be given&#151;in that terribly insensitive phrase&#151;reflection time, whether they will be allowed to stay in the country, and whether they will be able to go home to whatever they may face there. I put sanctuary first. It is the aspect of Christian compassion, which I am sure is common to other religions, that we should first mark in analysing this problem.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para139"></a>The trafficker must be the subject of firm law and condign punishment. I fully endorse the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, about the difficulties of creating a plain, straightforward offence of trafficking that can easily be enforced. We lawyers will solve the problem once given the problem to solve. Given the offence, it is much more important to ensure enforcement of the law. I suggest three ways. The first may offend my libertarian spirit, but I propose very powerful rights of search by the police in brothels or similar places where women and children are being kept for trafficking purposes. That will instil fear into the traffickers and their systems; the fear of being caught. Secondly, once caught there will be a ruthless search to obtain the assets they have acquired from this crime, both here and abroad, through international co-operation if necessary. Thirdly, once convicted they go to gaol for a very long time. Trafficking demands tough law.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para140"></a>This is a problem of the highest social and moral importance. This country's citizens&#151;like any other country's citizens&#151;will think to themselves, "This problem cannot possibly exist in the United Kingdom. <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is a problem from abroad. Let someone else solve it. I refuse to accept that my nation is part of it". That I suspect is the thinking of many people in many countries. How wrong it is.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para141"></a>We need to establish the scale of this problem in our own community by public debate, research and, if necessary, annual reports and what is being done about it. In addition&#151;here again I endorse what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, said&#151;we cannot simply pass a tough law and expect a police force that is inexperience not only in detecting this type of crime but in handling the victims of it to cope with it. Once training has been given, this crime should be a key performance indicator in major police forces in this country.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para142"></a>In raising the size of this problem in the community, let it be put on the basis that the problem must be solved. In Bleak House Charles Dickens made the following statement which I adopt, because of my concerns for children's charities, and which I connect to this problem:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the little world in which children live, nothing is more keenly felt, nothing more finely perceived than injustice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para143"></a>
What a terrible injustice it is for a child to be treated as sexual merchandise, cheap labour or a second-rate soldier. It is appalling. It demands action. I have no doubt that those speaking for the Government today will explain to us what can be done.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_time11"></a><H5>7.53 p.m.</st></H5>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   My Lords, I join others in thanking my noble friend Lord Alton for giving us a chance to discuss this very distressing topic today. His timing is impeccable, at least I hope that it is, because the Government have promised to legislate on the matter. I hope that that promise can be spelt out tonight with rather more specific timing. It is quite unacceptable that police forces and prosecutors have to rely on two clauses in a 46 year-old statute which was not designed for the purposes of human trafficking and which offers penalties wholly inappropriate for that trade.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para144"></a>Other countries are ahead of us both in legislation and in care. Therefore, it behoves the Government to treat this matter with great urgency. We cannot drag our feet. I know that the Minister will tell us that he cannot forecast future legislative programmes. But I hope that he will be a little more constructive than that. I look forward to his stretching the bounds of ministerial responsibility in a positive direction.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para145"></a> I strongly support the notion of a reflection break. However, I want to sound a note of caution which I hope will not be regarded as unduly timid. We are dealing here with children who have been abused in a dreadful way and who have systematically been stripped of all sense of dignity, self-confidence and trust in others. So they must have time to consider their position and have support to regain some of those qualities. It may take some decades, if ever. But they need some months for that.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para146"></a>I differ from some of the action groups in the notion that, if at the end of that time they conclude that they cannot give evidence, they should not thereby be <P>


<a name="column_904"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 904</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debarred from long-term asylum. That sounds harsh. But we must deal with a dreadful trade. It is one which is growing and is driven by traffickers. It would be a Faustian bargain indeed if we were to lean so hard to help the present victims that we allowed that trade to grow and endanger future generations of children. So one needs to have a balanced situation. That is not an easy stage to reach. It sounds very unfeeling, but certainly on my part it is not meant to be.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para147"></a>I have greatly enjoyed today's debate. I agree with everything that has been said. It is not in my character or nature to repeat those things, so I propose to terminate my contribution here.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I join all other noble Lords who have expressed their thanks and congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on initiating a notable debate which I hope will be influential on the Government's thinking when they frame the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para148"></a>There are no statistics, as has been said, on people trafficking, because the majority of the victims are not recorded. Most of the victims suffer in silence in their brothels and sweatshops, terrified into submission by threats, blackmail and violence. But various figures have been given. Among other commentators, the Home Office Minister, Angela Eagle, has said that the scale of the problem is almost as great as that of drugs. There is no doubt that we are looking at what the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has called a huge global plague.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para149"></a>There are two aspects to this menace, both of which have been touched on by your Lordships this evening. There is the need for domestic and European legislation and policing, which is dealt with in the White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Haven. The second is the much harder question of how we cope with the social and economic factors which give rise to the phenomenon in the countries of origin. The White Paper says that we are determined to address the overseas component of organised immigration crime. It acknowledges that we have to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"address the factors which make people vulnerable to exploitation such as poverty, war and repression".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para150"></a>
Much of that has been echoed in your Lordships' speeches today.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para151"></a>The White Paper makes a distinction between people smuggling, which is the facilitation of illegal entry with the consent of the immigrant, and people trafficking, where the agent plans to exploit the immigrant by coercing that person into low paid work or sexual servitude. The Home Office believes that the majority of illegal immigrants fully consent to the transaction although there is a grey area between the two categories, where the person first agrees to certain conditions but later wants to escape from the illegal bargain.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para152"></a>With others, we fully support the Government in their intention to make human trafficking a specific offence in accordance with the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the EU <P>


<a name="column_905"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Framework Decision on trafficking. I take it that, as many noble Lords have already said, the definition is bound to follow that which is contained in these two instruments. I cannot see how any other solution would be possible.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para153"></a>However, I am not sure that increasing the maximum sentence for the offence of being concerned with arrangements for bringing illegal entrants into the UK to 14 years is likely to have much of a deterrent effect on the traffickers. I agree that the sentence should be long one, as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, said. But the money that these people make is enormous, so the deterrent effect of the possibility of conviction is quite small. We have no accurate information about the scale of the crime, but the White Paper calculates that some 35,000 people who tried to evade border controls in 2000 were assisted by the criminal gangs. If one compares that with the number found guilty of offences equivalent to trafficking, which has varied between 115 and 150 over the past five years, one can see that the number of people detected is a minute fraction of those who commit the crime.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para154"></a>The only way to increase the conviction rate would be to put more police and Immigration Service resources into catching the offenders. That would be the most effective deterrent. Perhaps, as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, suggested, we need to give police more powers to search brothels and other sexual establishments to enable them to catch such criminals. Where they have done such work, they have been effective. There have been several major police raids on sex establishments, and each trawl has netted quite a few people. I do not know why they do not undertake more, but perhaps it is because so few officers are engaged in such work.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para155"></a>Since it was established in March 2000, we have heard much about Project Reflex&#151;although the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was the only one to mention it today&#151;but it is not clear whether it is simply a label for doing things that we should have been doing anyway. The Government say that they have brought together all the key agencies involved in the interception and prosecution of traffickers, such as the Immigration Service, NCIS, the security agencies and the police, and have co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the European Union and further afield. In a Written Answer, the Minister, Bob Ainsworth, said that NCIS had been a major contributor to a project managed by Interpol in Lyons to improve the collection and sharing of information on organised crime groups involved in illegal immigration and trafficking.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para156"></a>Again, the question is whether any of the agencies concerned have been given extra resources, or whether they are expected to manage those tasks on the same budget. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that. I note that some additional funding was provided by the EU's STOP II Programme to, for example, NCIS and the Crown Prosecution Service, and it would be useful if the Minister said something about the projects that they have undertaken.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20313-07_para157"></a>One highly visible initiative has been secondment of immigration liaison officers to the key countries where the gangs are operating&#151;especially the Balkans, I understand&#151;and we are supporting an EU initiative in Bosnia and an International Organisation for Migration initiative in Kosovo. Unfortunately, where a large number of international personnel is present, as in the Balkans, there is a ready market for the trafficking of women into prostitution.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para158"></a>Helga Konrad, head of the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe's new Task Force on Trafficking of Women and Children, which was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Maclennan, said that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the influx of men in uniforms creates a market for sex work".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para159"></a>
The International Organisation for Migration, which published a study on trafficking in the Balkans, states that the region is particularly vulnerable to trafficking, being in a post-conflict situation and adjacent to both rich and poor countries.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para160"></a>The UN protocol on trafficking requires state parties to consider measures for the physical, psychological and social recovery of victims, as has been mentioned several times during this debate, and it is good to see that the south-eastern Europe task force will support the development of shelters offering security, medical care, legal and psychological counselling and repatriation assistance. Ms Konrad says that it is not enough merely to provide places to store people until they can be sent home.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para161"></a> In Britain, only one local authority, West Sussex, is providing any support. What support will the Government offer West Sussex, and are they concerned about the 66 children who have gone missing while in the care of social services? Several noble Lords asked whether the Government have any further thoughts about the assurance given by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, last July that they were considering how an NGO could provide support and advice for victims of trafficking. Will they request bids in the near future so that the arrangements can be in place before the legislation, which I assume will be in the next Queen's Speech&#151;although I do not expect the Minister to answer that question this evening?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para162"></a>Anti-Slavery International, which has done so much to call attention to the problem of trafficking, calling it a modern-day slave trade, cited Mary Robinson as saying that human rights must be at the core of a credible anti-trafficking strategy. The UN Secretary-General, in a note to the sub-commission last July, said that trafficking and related practices such as debt bondage, forced prostitution and forced labour constitute violations of the most basic human rights. He also said that special attention should be given to the needs of trafficked children, including their health and educational needs.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para163"></a> The issue of trafficking has been discussed by several UN agencies, especially by the rapporteurs on the sale of children and on the human rights of migrants. The question is: how can the work of those UN agencies and other human rights bodies be <P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dovetailed into the policies of Britain and the European Union so that, as the Secretary-General put it, those issues are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not simply reduced to problems of migration, problems of public order, or problems of organised crime"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-07_para164"></a>
With the Human Rights Commission's annual meeting about to start in Geneva, will the Government consider what can be done there to focus international attention on the victims of trafficking and to ensure that the work of the special rapporteurs is facilitated by adequate funding and support personnel?
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para165"></a>Perhaps I may give one example from last year's report by the rapporteur on the rights of the child. She expressed concern about the extent to which Nigerian women and girls are falling victim to trafficking gangs. They are lured to Europe, mainly to Italy, apparently, by promises of a better life&#151;in the same way as my noble friend Lord Maclennan described happening in the Ukraine&#151;but end up owing 50,000 dollars to the pimps to pay for their passage, which they can hope to redeem only by years of squalid servitude. If they are caught, they are dumped unceremoniously back in Nigeria&#151;500 of them in 1999 alone&#151;but the traffickers are rarely brought to justice. We must do something to persuade the victims of such offences to give evidence. It will not be enough, as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, suggested, merely to offer victim protection programmes here. There must be protection against victimisation of their families in their countries of origin.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para166"></a>The wicked trade in human beings&#151;largely women and children&#151;is a global menace on the scale of drugs. We fully support the measures that the Government have taken so far, and we will co-operate with them on the promised legislation. We appeal to them not to forget the victims and to use their best endeavours in the European Union to see that the human rights dimension of this dreadful phenomenon is high on the agenda.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-07_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I found it profoundly disturbing when I began to consider this problem to realise that trafficking in human beings is probably as old as mankind. It existed as a normal condition of life in all communities, including our own, until relatively recently. That gives me no satisfaction, but we must recognise that fact.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para167"></a> What is new today? We have had centuries to grow and develop out of that problem, while other parts of the world have, sadly, perhaps not yet had time to get away from it. That is one problem. We see such problems in a light different from that of other places. My noble friend Lord Moynihan mentioned information systems in the modern era, but the engine of change that is driving this appalling trade is the ease of international travel.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para168"></a>Trafficking in human beings when they had to be walked 200 miles perhaps may not have been serious. Today, when they can be flown around the globe in hours, we have a very different scale of problem. This <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a most desperate and difficult problem. We must also realise that we will not remove the problem if we merely cure it within our own boundaries. We shall still have on our conscience what is happening elsewhere. That is a profound difficulty.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para169"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, I do not intend to go over ground that has been extremely well covered, but two or three things stand out. First, at present we do not have adequate machinery in this country to deal with the problem. We need a multi-disciplinary agency to deal with it. We must involve the Immigration Service, Customs and Excise, the police and the social services. That can be put together in a co-operative way, and I am sure that all those people can be brought together. However, the most important point about bringing them together is that, if we can begin to get evidence of the scale of the problem and, more importantly, get some of the victims of that appalling trade into respite care where they can be properly looked after, we have some prospect&#151;only some&#151;of getting adequate intelligence to begin to take action against the perpetrators of that desperate, awful trade.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para170"></a>Intelligence is everything, which takes us back to the international nature of the problem. We desperately need international intelligence. It will take strong international co-operation to begin to tackle the problem. It will require co-operation between agencies that can supervise the transport business. We are not just talking about air transport. Although air transport is quick, road transport comes into the business as well. We must be able to work through the ports. As we have seen in a limited way, if the supervision at ports is inadequate&#151;I refer to the appalling situation at Sangatte in France, where failure adequately to protect the transport depot has stopped freight traffic through the Channel Tunnel&#151;we will have a real difficulty. We must work hard to make sure that there is international co-operation. I am sure that the Minister will cover that in his reply. It is agreed in the international bodies, but I am not convinced that the necessary work is being done.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para171"></a>We must also consider seriously the point that it does not really matter what the victims of trafficking are tied into. They are victims, whether it happens to be the child sex trade, cheap child labour in an unregulated and often dangerous environment or domestic work in conditions of virtual slavery, which is not unknown. The offence is the same&#151;the destruction of that person's freedom and right to live the kind of life that we would consider right and proper. The offence of trafficking, whatever the end-product, is the same.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para172"></a>It is not a question of handing down a severe sentence if the people are caught. I suspect that, at this end of the line&#151;we are, so to speak, importers of trafficked people&#151;we will not get the people who initiate the trade and create the market. We will probably get relatively small players, but they certainly need to be stopped. The other side of the matter, about which the Government are taking action, is the need to be able to deprive people of their profits from the enterprise. I take my hat off to the Government about <P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that: the Proceeds of Crime Bill, when it eventually goes through, should be a strong weapon in that regard. The Bill has had its First Reading in this House, and most Members who saw it took one look and nearly panicked at its scale. However, once it is on the statute book it will be enormously helpful.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para173"></a>I suspect that the trade is part of the global economy. It may be that we cannot stamp it out absolutely, but we can certainly go a long way towards removing it from within our own boundaries. I support any government action to achieve that. It is an appalling trade, and we should use all our international influence to diminish it elsewhere in so far as it is possible for us to do so.

<A NAME="20313-07_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, on introducing such an important and timely debate and on his graphic description and analysis of the problem. It set the tone for a debate that, we all recognise, has included many contributions of high quality and proper emotional content. The heinous crime of trafficking and its appalling consequences for the victims is a profoundly emotional issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para174"></a>My noble friend Lady Howells of St Davids offered an important historical perspective on the issue. I may not be able to describe the debate as historic, but my noble friend will recognise that the city of Liverpool has been represented in the debate by the noble Lord who introduced it and the city of Bristol by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol. She will also have noticed that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, was present and contributed to the debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para175"></a>As has been graphically and accurately described, in people trafficking we see the modern manifestation of the worst aspects of enslavement and the subjection of people to terrible privations. People trafficking differs from people smuggling, which is the facilitation of illegal entry, and should not be viewed in the same light. People trafficking is transporting people in order to exploit them through forced prostitution or bonded labour. As such, it is a serious, organised international criminal activity and an evil trade on which we are determined to crack down. Because of the ongoing exploitation involved in trafficking, it is not primarily an immigration offence, although it can, of course, involve crossing a border. It can occur within a country, as well as between states.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para176"></a>Trafficking is a largely hidden crime, and it is difficult to form an accurate estimate of its extent. A Home Office research study Stopping Traffic, published two years ago estimated that between 140 and 1,400 women were trafficked to the UK each year for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, we must all recognise that that is a rough estimate. Although the number of people trafficked into the UK may be small, when compared to the number smuggled in, the seriousness of the problem demands an appropriate response. Our debate emphasised the range of questions that must be answered.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20313-07_para177"></a>I might add that I wish that my noble friend Lord Rooker were in position to provide the definitive answers required. As noble Lords will have recognised, Lady Rooker is seriously ill, and Lord Rooker is at her side, where he should be. I am sure that we all wish Lady Rooker well.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para178"></a>The debate has done a great deal to highlight the scale and complexity of the problem and the devastating effects that the crime has on its victims. I shall do what I can to highlight the measures that the Government have set in train to address the problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, the fact that the victims are, in the first instance, willing parties to the crime adds an extra dimension to the difficulty. As we know, however, many victims, having been grievously misled, seek to get themselves out of the situation in which they find themselves.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para179"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, properly asked that the UK should be at the forefront of an international effort. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, gave the Government credit for adopting this position. I should like to emphasise that fact. The Government were instrumental in negotiating the UN protocol on the prevention and suppression of trafficking, which has become the basis of international action to combat the crime. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who also reflected on this point.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para180"></a>The Government followed that up with a negotiation of an EU framework decision on trafficking for the purposes of sexual and labour exploitation that has just been adopted by member states. I wish to assure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that this is now in place.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para181"></a>The Government set out a comprehensive strategy for addressing trafficking in the recently published White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Havens. This strategy recognises the need for a multi-faceted response and is a four-pronged approach, covering the introduction of legislation, enforcement, prevention and protection for victims, and international co-operation to combat human trafficking.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para182"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tombs, asked where legislation fits in. We have acted in response to concern about the inadequacy of current legislation and available penalties by introducing a new offence of trafficking for prostitution in the forthcoming nationality, immigration and asylum Bill which will be brought before your Lordships' House shortly. The new offence will carry a severe maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para183"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, indicated that such punishments should be severe. My noble friend Lord Brennan used the word condign. Fourteen years may not entirely meet his definition of that but it expresses the Government's view that these are very serious crimes. It is the same as for many drugs trafficking offences.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para184"></a>The new offence is a stopgap measure to close a current loophole. The Government intend to create new wide-ranging offences for trafficking for both <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sexual and labour exploitation, using future criminal justice legislation that will implement the reform of sex offences.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para185"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Tombs, invited me to foresee the next Queen's Speech. From my lowly position, I dare not do that but I can indicate to the House that I would not be talking in such assertive terms about this legislation unless I believed it was about to happen.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para186"></a>I assure my noble friend Lord Brett that these measures will also take into account our international obligations under the trafficking protocol to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the EU framework decision on trafficking for the purpose of sexual and labour exploitation. It has been estimated that the profits from people trafficking are equal to those from drug trafficking and the effects on the lives of those involved can be just as damaging.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para187"></a>In recognising this, we also intend to use the Proceeds of Crime Bill, currently making its way through Parliament&#151;of which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, gave favourable notice&#151;to seize and confiscate the criminal assets of those involved in crime. It will provide another way of dismantling and disrupting traffickers and we shall, of course, have an early opportunity to debate that legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para188"></a>We are determined to ensure there is an effective enforcement response to people trafficking. That is why we set up Project Reflex in 2000 to focus on combating wider organised immigration crime, including trafficking. Reflex brings together key agencies&#151;the National Crime Squad, NCIS, the Immigration Service, the security and intelligence services, FCO, the Metropolitan, Kent and other police forces&#151;in a co-ordinated strategy to tackle the problem. Reflex has been working to develop intelligence in the UK and overseas and to co-ordinate national and international investigations against organised immigration crime.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para189"></a>I can assure the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that additional resources in the last spending round led to the creation of a joint operational unit involving the National Crime Squad and Immigration Service that has recently become operational. It will significantly enhance the available capability to tackle people trafficking. It will be able to carry out an investigation into organised crime syndicates which several noble Lords have indicated are responsible for so much of this activity.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para190"></a>In committing ourselves to the UN protocol and EU framework decision on trafficking, we recognise that effective action must be conducted with our international partners. That point was emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, stressed the international dimensions of this issue as did the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para191"></a>The European Council at Tampere set out an agenda for tackling illegal immigration, especially human trafficking. The UK welcomes the progress already made there, as well as some successful returns programmes with a range of countries. Bilateral and <P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>multilateral collaborative operations are equally important, such as the EU high impact operation in 2001. That was a joint initiative with EU applicant countries to tackle illegal immigration across the eastern borders of the EU. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, accurately described some of the problems which occur in countries on the borders of the EU where a good deal of this activity is generated.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para192"></a>The UK is developing a network of immigration liaison officers, working with other governments to encourage and support action to disrupt criminal gangs and create a joint intelligence structure across Europe and beyond. Across the EU and elsewhere, other liaison officers have proved very valuable. In the light of this, we are considering extending this network into other source and transit countries.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para193"></a> We also support EU member state organisations responsible for action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of women and children in particular. This is done via the UK contribution to the EU STOP Programme, to which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred. That was established by the European Council in 1996. A second phase, STOP II, got underway last year and the UK currently takes the lead with five projects through NCIS, the NGO Change and other organisations. We are active on this front, although, of course, it will take time for the results to show.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para194"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, emphasised the need to offer support to the victims. Other noble Lords emphasised the distressing aspect of this trade in terms of its victims. They may need particular support to help them escape their circumstances and in certain cases, help law enforcement tackle organised criminal gangs through their testimonies. The Government will make special arrangements for the protection of victims, where they are willing to come forward to help us deal with the criminals, a point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para195"></a> The Government will also consider whether it is appropriate to allow victims to remain in this country. As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, suggested, we will look at the Italian and Dutch models on this issue, but there already exist provisions for victims of trafficking to be granted exceptional leave to remain in this country. What all noble Lords will also recognise is that we need to strike a balance between that and ensuring that we put as strong a limit as we possibly can on the opportunities for this trade and the rewards derived from it by criminals.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para196"></a>Where the victims wish to return home, we shall help them to do so. That will provide initial counselling for victims, ensure that they have suitable accommodation at their destination and provide help to enable them to reintegrate into their own community. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, emphasised that we will need to be assured that they are not returning to an environment in which they are under threat from those who perpetrated the original crimes against them.
<P>


<a name="column_913"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para197"></a>Over the coming months, we shall discuss how to take that work forward with statutory and voluntary organisations. My noble friend Lord Brett asked about that point. The White Paper also sets out our intention to develop a best practice guide on victims of trafficking, which will act as an A to Z manual for immigration officers, police and others who may deal with trafficking victims.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para198"></a>Having outlined the Home Office's response to trafficking, I should also mention that other departments of government are active. I feel less than qualified to speak on behalf of the Home Office, but it would be remiss of me if I did not also mention the responsibilities of the Foreign Office and DfID in combating the trade. Both are committed to tackling trafficking on a global scale. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol emphasised, this is an international problem that can be tackled only through international co-operation. We are seeking to raise awareness in source and transit countries through bilateral and multilateral development programmes targeted at the issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para199"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, referred to Sudan. I am not able to spend the amount of time on that that she deserves, given her great interest in the issue, but I think she will be reassured that our ambassador in Khartoum continues to work closely with the Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children and with UNICEF and Save the Children on these issues. The Sudanese Government recently agreed to the US proposal for an international team to investigate the problem in Sudan. The team will include members of British NGOs, such as Save the Children. We look forward to the outcome of that activity with some optimism.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para200"></a>We have also given &#163;3 million to the International Labour Organisation programme in the greater Mecon region, covering parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. I am sure that that commends itself to my noble friend Lord Brett, given his close relationship with that organisation.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para201"></a> In conclusion, we are committed to tackling people trafficking. We are conscious that we cannot do that alone. To have a significant impact on people trafficking, in particular the trafficking of women, we need to work together internationally. We must work with our partners in the EU and with source and transit countries, as well as voluntary and international agencies, to ensure co-ordinated and effective action worldwide. In the UK, we must make certain that the enforcement agencies, the police and the intelligence agencies have an effective response to ensure that traffickers cannot profit from their crimes and that victims are afforded necessary protection and support.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para202"></a>We have made a start on setting up the necessary arrangements. There is a great deal more to be done, but I hope that I can assure the House that the Government are addressing the problem with the seriousness that it merits. That seriousness and the sense of urgency in this evening's emotional pleas&#151;based on rationality, but appealing to our common <P>

<A NAME="20313-07_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, the whole House will join the Minister in wishing the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and Lady Rooker our best at this time. We hope that Lady Rooker will quickly return to good health. We particularly understand that to have to step into the breach and deal with tonight's debate required a considerable effort on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, to master the details of the brief, which he has done magnificently. We are all indebted to him for the way in which he has dealt with all the contributions this evening.
<P>

<a name="20313-07_para203"></a>It is not part of the tradition of your Lordships' House for the mover of the Motion to speak at any length. I shall abide by that tradition, but I should like to summarise the three themes that have run through our debate: the desire for protection, for prosecution and for international co-operation. This has been a pre-legislative debate in every respect. We shall have the chance to bring forward proposals when we debate the immigration Bill and to hold the Government to the promises that they have made. I was particularly struck by what the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said about the opportunity to deal with the confiscation of the assets of those involved in trafficking when we consider the Proceeds of Crime Bill. Taken together with the punitive sentences that the Minister referred to, that may well be one of the best ways of tackling the problem.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para0"></a>I am grateful to those who have indicated that they intend to speak this evening and I look forward very much to what each of them has to say. I have received a kind letter from the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, who apologises that he cannot be here this evening, but is happy for me to say that he supports the Bill. He reminds me that he resigned from the Garrick Club some years ago because he and others failed to persuade it to change the rules to admit women as members.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para1"></a>The Bill follows precisely the terms of a Private Member's Bill that has twice been introduced in another place by Robert Walter, the Conservative MP for North Dorset, with all-party support.

<FONT SIZE=3>drafting the Bill. The Bill is also supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which proposed in November 1998 that there should be a new sex equality Act to update the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts. The EOC said then:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The new statute should cover all private members' clubs which have admitted both sexes to a membership category, and where some club facilities and services have been open to both men and women".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para3"></a>The EOC's report Equality in the 21st Century&#151;A new sex equality law for Britain says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The evidence available to the EOC indicates very little voluntary change in the sector and complaints reinforce the views that the exclusion of such clubs results in a variety of discriminatory rules and arrangements which seek to perpetuate stereotypical images of men and women; and which limit women's participation in club activities in a number of ways".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para5"></a>The Bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to bring it broadly into line with the Race Relations Acts 1968 and 1976, which prohibit race discrimination in private clubs with 25 or more members. The Bill does not make single-sex clubs unlawful. Nor does it outlaw single-sex sporting events or single-sex changing rooms, saunas, gyms or lavatories. It applies equally to discrimination against men.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para6"></a>The Bill has nothing to do with political correctness. It is about decent, civilised behaviour. The aim is to say clearly and unambiguously to private member clubs that if they have membership categories for men and for women, those categories must be open equally to both sexes. If a golf club, for example, wished to offer a cheaper associate membership that restricted the hours of play or limited the rooms in the clubhouse to which that category of member had access, or perhaps did not grant full voting rights, that arrangement would be lawful as long as one category of membership were not restricted to men and another category to women.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para7"></a>The Bill also says that a single-sex club that admits male and female guests must do so on equal terms and provide them with equal access to club facilities. That would put an end to women guests being excluded from men-only bars or being prevented from walking up a club's main staircase.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para8"></a>The Bill is very simple, with only one substantive clause. That clause introduces new sections to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which would follow the existing Section 29 of that Act. New Section 29A makes it unlawful for a private member club to discriminate against a woman or man in its terms of membership. It provides also that facilities offered to male members must be offered on equal terms to female members. New Section 29B provides for single-sex clubs to remain so and new Section 29C allows clubs to continue offering sporting events and competitions on a single-sex basis but provides that where there is sufficient demand from female members for an equivalent competition, one must be provided. That new section also provides that if prize money of less than &#163;1,000 is offered in such an event, equal prize money must be offered in the female competition.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para9"></a>When considering whether to introduce the Bill, I sought to establish the extent of the problem that women face in private member clubs. I was shocked by the number of reports that I received&#151;particularly those relating to golf and working men's clubs. The highest-profile case in the gentlemen's club category is the Carlton, which was founded in 1832 by Tories opposed to the Reform Act. I can do no better than quote the words of Robert Walter, MP, speaking in another place on 11th December 2001:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I had personal experience of the injustice of a club that offered membership to both men and women but which discriminated against women by offering them only inferior membership. They had second-class status with no access to the governance of that club . . . I had been part of a campaign to remedy that injustice. On two separate occasions, the club narrowly missed the opportunity to move itself into the modern world".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 11/12/2002; col. 736.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para10"></a>
He resigned in November 1999. I understand that a number of other prominent Conservative supporters have also resigned.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para11"></a>Mr. Iain Duncan Smith has, to his great credit, refused to join&#151;becoming the first leader of his party since the mid-19th century not to do so. In an interview in the Spectator, Mr. Duncan Smith said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As the leader of a Conservative Party that believes that there should be no 'no-go' areas for women, I will have to say that I can't do it while it is different for many of my colleagues here who would like to become members but cannot".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para13"></a> Good for him&#151;and well done those members of your Lordships' House who have resigned or declined to join the Carlton because of its policy towards women.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para14"></a>Mrs. Wendy Lea is the licensee of the Red Lion pub in Crown Passage, just across the road from the Carlton. She was quoted in the Daily Telegraph on 29th December as saying of Mr. Duncan Smith:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"He's just gone up in my estimation. Fair play to the man. He is standing up for women's rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para15"></a>
Mrs. Lea was asked whether she would like to be a member of the Carlton and replied:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am not necessarily saying that I'd like to be but I would like the chance to be. I just think women should have the right. I could understand if they was running around naked and they didn't want women in for that reason. But you would no longer be able to run a club that's whites only but you're still allowed to exclude women because of their sex. You're not allowed to be racist but you can still be sexist".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para16"></a>
The Carlton is clearly different from the Athenaeum, which admitted women as full members without restrictions from 2nd January. I offer my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Greenfield, on being among the first distinguished women members.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para17"></a> In the interests of political balance, I will refer to the problems in working men's clubs. There are about 5,500 such clubs on the register of the Committee of Registered Clubs Association&#151;known as CORCA. There are eight main groups, including political clubs and service clubs such as those of the Royal British Legion, RAF and Royal Navy. The principal group is the CIU&#151;the working men's Club and Institute Union, which represents 2,700 of the total.
<P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para18"></a>Of those clubs, 1,080 or 40 per cent grant women full membership rights. Of the remaining 1,620 clubs, eight are single sex. They will not be affected by my Bill unless they discriminate against women as visitors. That leaves 1,612 clubs&#151;60 per cent of the total&#151;where women join as a different class of member, generally at a lower subscription. They are likely to find some parts of the club barred to them and will be prevented from attending the AGM or standing for election.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para19"></a>An example of the sort of problem that women face is that of Sunnybank Social Club in Silsden, near Skipton, where a group of young women were caught playing snooker and told they had no business there. Two men who came to their aid were charged with bringing the club into disrepute. One of the women members said about the men to the Independent:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "They have a Victorian attitude. They'd rather have women at the kitchen sink, on a ball and chain".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para20"></a>
The CIU, to its credit, is trying to do something. At its conference on 6th April, a motion to move the infamous rule 12(e) will be proposed. That rule states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Associate pass cards cannot be purchased by women".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para21"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para22"></a>Those cards are a means of identification and allow a member of one CIU club to visit another and enjoy as a guest almost the same level of membership. If rule 12(e) were abolished, women who are full members of a non-discriminating club would be able to visit a club that does discriminate and insist on equal treatment. That would do nothing for women who are members of clubs that discriminate but would help. But your Lordships should not hold their breath. The CIU has tried three times previously to abolish rule 12(e) and failed each time to get the necessary two thirds majority. I suspect that it will be necessary for the Bill to be on the statute book before the CIU scraps rule 12(e), even though many members believe that clubs must change just to survive.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para23"></a>The Penlan Social Club in Swansea voted to give women full membership two years ago. Its general secretary, John Morgan, commented:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "It's simple: female unfriendly clubs will close. Giving women full membership has made a big difference in terms of the dynamism of our club. We have a lot more going on. We need to persuade that flat-cap element who don't like change".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para24"></a>
That is wholly in line with the official view of the CIU. Its general secretary, Kevin Smyth, is happy for me to quote him:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The union's National Executive firmly believes that the future of clubs in our organisation is tied up with giving women full equality".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para25"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para26"></a>Probably the thorniest problem of all is golf clubs. Just one year ago, Golf World published a survey of social attitudes. The findings, as reported in the Independent on Sunday, were that golf clubs were
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>charged different fees for full membership and that there was a restriction on the hours that women can play.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para28"></a> A couple of years ago, a survey in Women in Golf magazine showed that only 56 per cent of women could stand for election to the main committee, 21 per cent had men-only access in parts of the clubs and 35 per cent did not provide women with full voting rights.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para29"></a>The descriptions of some of the practices followed and the attitudes displayed beggar belief. There are scores of examples of sexist, humiliating treatment. According to the Daily Telegraph, at Gay Hill Golf Club at Wythall in Worcestershire, a white line was painted across the floor of the bar to mark the territory that women could not enter. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club imposed a 30 per cent levy on subscriptions for men and women members alike but denied women any vote on whether the levy should be raised.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para30"></a>Progress is to be found here and there. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, informs me that Woking Golf Club granted full membership rights to women at its 2001 AGM and that other clubs have extended the hours that women may play. The most accurate comment on the state of women's golf generally is from Tim Howland, chief executive of the Ladies European tour. He is quoted in the March 2001 edition of Golf World as saying,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "It's mainly men who laugh about signs like 'No dogs, no women'. It's not something that women find funny. This sort of behaviour doesn't happen on the continent, only in Britain, and it's a sad indictment of how golf treats women and children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para31"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para32"></a>That comment applies with varying degrees of force across private clubs generally. I hope that the House agrees that it is time we did something and will give the Bill a Second Reading. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20313-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, may I be the first to congratulate the noble Lord on introducing a most sensible Bill and doing so with great &#233;lan and panache. He has both amused and horrified us with the various stories he has told.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para34"></a>I very much welcome this sensible approach which fills a gap left by the Anti-Discrimination Act 1975. I can remember being a young MP at that time and warmly welcoming and assisting in the passage of that Act. It was very much a landmark at the time. Although it could not deal with everything, one of its most sensible provisions was the setting up of the Equal Opportunities Commission, which provided a permanent watching brief; but it did leave that particular gap.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para35"></a>I was reminded by the noble Lord's reference to the staircase of an experience that I had in a gentlemen's club. I was astonished, astounded and infuriated at being hustled up a back staircase, as though I were being surreptitiously smuggled in as an illegal entrant. At that time I swore that I would never again enter that club until I could sweep up and down its main grand <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>staircase. That was many years ago and still the position is not altogether satisfactory, as the noble Lord has clearly indicated.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para36"></a>That kind of example applies not only to grand gentlemen's clubs. It certainly applies to sporting clubs. My late mother would have been absolutely thrilled by this Bill. She was a keen sportswoman and also very keen on equality for men and women. I remember her being irritated intensely by the second-rate treatment of women in golf clubs and even, I am sorry to say, in the bowls world of that time. I remember one indoor bowls club that contained both men's and women's clubs. The men and women had to share the various indoor rinks, which had to be rationed because there were more people who wanted to play than rinks available. Surprise, surprise! Who got the lion's share of both the rinks and the time allocated? Always the men. To some extent, that also applied outdoors, where there were several clubs, some for men and some for women&#151;none mixed at that time&#151;which used the same outdoor greens. It was common practice that the women always made do with the poorer greens and the poorest times.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para37"></a> My mother was not one to take things lying down. She always fought a fierce battle on these matters. But there was no legislation to back it up and at that time too many were prepared to be submissive. So my mother's preaching rebellion did not always work, but she did her damnedest, and had she been alive today she would have been particularly pleased with the provisions of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para38"></a>I have only one reservation&#151;absolutely nothing to do with the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner&#151;which is that the Bill amends the existing legislation. It seems to me a great pity that we cannot have one new Bill that would bring together the anti-discrimination legislation and the equal pay legislation, updated to fill the gaps, so that we could have one Act of Parliament to which we could all refer on this subject. One of my constant beefs is that nowadays one can never read a Bill without having to read another in order to make full sense of it, and that is a distressing trend.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para39"></a>However, having got that beef off my chest, I welcome this sensible Bill which takes a moderate but firm path. I wish it well; I hope that it has a speedy passage and quickly becomes law.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para40"></a>Only a short time ago we were debating the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002, which has now received Royal Assent. That Act allows political parties to have all-women shortlists when selecting candidates. It came about in recognition of the fact that women of all political parties experienced great difficulties in getting selected without special measures being in place.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para41"></a>Over the years many Acts of Parliament have been designed to break down barriers that prevent women from taking part in activities that they wish to pursue&#151;the 1918 Act, which allowed women to vote and to be elected to the House of Commons, the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the establishment of the Equal Opportunities Commission&#151;a raft of measures assisting women at work, women in politics, enabling women to play their part in the democracy of the country, as well as laws to protect women from domestic violence. In those heady days of the 1970s, many of us believed that the battle for women's rights had been won. Only later did we realise that still many battles lay ahead of us.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para42"></a>Today we have before us another Bill that will be of great assistance in eradicating discrimination against women. But why do we have such a Bill before us? Why, at the beginning of the 21st century, should it be necessary to have legislation to ensure that women will be treated as equal citizens? Surely, we should by now have a much more enlightened approach to the rights of women. There should not be a need for legislation. Unfortunately, however, there is.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para43"></a>I am sure that a number of noble Baronesses in your Lordships' House today could, like the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, could give examples of discrimination encountered when entering private clubs.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para44"></a>Perhaps I can give one experience that I had several years ago when I was working in a by-election in a constituency in Wales, which I shall not name. After canvassing one evening, the people I was with invited me to a club to take a drink with them. I happily went along. Approaching the club, the men walked ahead and I followed them. When I got to the door, the door steward stopped me. He said, "You can't go in this way". I asked, "Why not?", because my male colleagues had just gone through the door ahead of me. He said, "This is a male-only bar and you will have to walk down the back lane to get to the lounge bar". Instead of using the back stairs, I had to go down a back lane to reach the bar. As I did so, I had never felt such a sense of total humiliation. The only reason I could not go through the main door was that I was a woman. That is one example of discrimination that I have experienced. There are others, such as being refused a drink when I inadvertently entered a male-only bar. Unfortunately, still too many private clubs operate in that discriminatory way.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para45"></a>Based in the heart of Cardiff is the Cardiff and County Club. Several prominent women in Wales have tried to join that club. Glenys Kinnock and Eluned Morgan, Members of the European Parliament representing Wales, applied to join but were rejected. The Welsh electorate thought that they were good enough to serve Wales in the European Parliament but not good enough, because they were women, for the Cardiff and County Club. Apparently, there are no application forms in that club. One has to be invited to join. If one does not receive an invitation, one does not have an opportunity to join, and if one is a woman, one never gets an invitation.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para46"></a>In Cardiff, the capital city of Wales&#151;one of the most exciting and innovative young capitals in Europe&#151;we still find, in 2002, that women are rejected in this type of club. Carolyn Hitt, a journalist for the Western Mail, commented on Monday about this very club. She wrote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This exclusive clique is the last bastion of sexual inequality in Wales".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para47"></a>
But even with this club there are occasions when women can enter. They can go there for Saturday lunch, provided they are the guests of a member. However, male guests can attend any day of the week. Women can also go to the club if a member has hired a room for a private function such as a birthday party. Carolyn Hitt also said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An establishment that includes women may seem a straightforward case for the Equal Opportunities Commission, but there is nothing illegal about the Cardiff and County. The Sex Discrimination Act does not apply to private clubs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para48"></a>
Can my noble friend Lord Faulkner say whether his Bill covers the actions of the Cardiff and County Club and other clubs that operate in a similar manner? Will this Bill make their actions illegal? I hope that that is the case. However, if it is not, perhaps we can amend the Bill to ensure that it is.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para49"></a>I am sorry to say that there are many clubs in Wales and in the rest of the country that operate men-only bars, as well as other forms of restrictive measures towards women. It is a grave insult to women that this type of gender apartheid should have any place in today's society. I believe that the Bill will be a great step forward. I very much look forward to the day when it becomes an Act of Parliament.

<A NAME="20313-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I should like, first, to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, on bringing forward this Bill to get rid of sex discrimination in clubs. When I was at the Equal Opportunities Commission, almost from day one we received complaints from those who felt that they had been discriminated against in all sorts of clubs. Those complaints ranged from ones where, quite literally, women were allowed in free&#151;although, perhaps, for rather different purposes&#151;and men had to pay a rather high subscription, to all the other sorts of clubs that have been so well outlined tonight.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para50"></a>It is a great pleasure to be participating in such a debate and to note that the recommendations are being accepted by the other side of your Lordships' House. I well remember the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, who was so supportive when the Sex Discrimination Act was going through Parliament. We should never forget that that legislation was passed by a huge majority of both Houses. Indeed, only one or two people, who shall be nameless, took a different line. We must not overlook the fact that much has been achieved.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para51"></a>I have to confess to being, as it were, the "partner in crime" of the noble Lord, Lord Lester. After having had lunch with him one day at the Garrick Club, we walked up the stairs&#151;contrary to what was allowed&#151;<P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a form of protest. I have to say that they were rather clever about it: they took not the slightest bit of notice of us, which rather deflated the action that we had taken.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para52"></a>I find it rather depressing that this is the second time within two months that I find myself supporting a Bill that it really should not have been necessary to bring forward. The first, of course, was the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Bill. Frankly, determined and effective action by all political parties from 1975 onwards to ensure a balanced representation of both sexes in Parliament&#151;based, of course, on merit&#151;could easily have prevented the need for that legislation. More importantly, over the past 25 years it would have provided an enriched and far more representative Chamber against which the priorities for legislation of both sexes (both 50 per cents of the population) would have been debated and become law.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para53"></a>If that is so for parliamentary candidates, the case for clubs&#151;which are not genuinely single-sex clubs&#151;to have put their house voluntarily in order over the past 25 years is, frankly, even more glaring. As early as one year after the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, we know that the Race Relations Act actually included discrimination as regards clubs. Even as late as last year, a question on this very subject from the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, was put to the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. She replied that she felt that clubs would really like to be given time&#151;yet more time&#151;to do this voluntarily. I am a patient person. When I took over as deputy chairman of the EOC, I said that I thought it would be at least 20 years before we saw any real action in many areas. But 25 years on&#151;indeed, nearly 26 years&#151;from that Act, I believe that the time has come for this very clear and specific Bill. It certainly has my support.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para54"></a>This also illustrates the point of the 1974 government, who said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any exception weakens the principle of non-discrimination".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para55"></a>
I am afraid that that has proved to be all too correct. It is interesting that a number of organisations have adjusted themselves as regards exceptions. I have in mind, for example, some aspects of retirement and the height of police officers. I used to tease the miners' union leaders about the fact that women were not allowed down the mines&#151; indeed, it might be a rather better paid job these days than it was in the past&#151;but we know that there were reasons for that exception. Many of those exceptions have been ironed out, but, although it is another matter, much remains to be done on pensions.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para56"></a>What should the rules be for clubs, given not only that the concept of sex discrimination in employment, in education and in the provision of goods, facilities and services is illegal but also that, over the past 25 years, non-discrimination has become the generally accepted standard of behaviour in all areas covered by the Act? Of course, that is not always followed, but it is the generally accepted standard of behaviour. I will refer back to the famous case of the well-known men-only Fleet Street pub, "El Vino's", at which journalists <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made contacts and swapped stories. Women journalists were relegated to a different bar and therefore missed out on important professional relationships. Admittedly, that was a pub, not a club, but the economic and social disadvantage of being unable to mix with one's professional peers was firmly established when the complainant in that case won.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para57"></a>Certain men-only clubs recruit from specific groups; for example, the Garrick Club, which admits clergymen, actors, politicians and lawyers, and the Carlton Club, which is for Conservative politicians. Not only do those clubs discriminate on the grounds of sex, they deny women the opportunity to mix with their colleagues and to advance professionally. It is not too early to make that final breakthrough. All clubs have membership rules. Most select new members on the agreement of existing members, and the most popular clubs have considerable waiting lists. The Bill does not affect those aspects; it deals solely with sex discrimination in the selection of members and the granting of second-class membership to females, without their being given the right to influence change.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para58"></a>I am especially irritated by sex discrimination in sports clubs, although I am glad that the population's enthusiasm for sport is growing. Membership should be granted on the basis of such criteria as the applicant's sporting ability, enthusiasm or knowledge, regardless of sex. Golf clubs and others have not woken up to the fact that huge numbers of women earn a good deal of money. In addition, many women have the financial and professional expertise to contribute a great deal to the running of the club and to take into account women's needs. Certain golf clubs have rules that women cannot play at weekends as if only men work during the week. A much fairer way to allocate weekend playing time would be to appeal to those who can play during the week to give way voluntarily at weekends.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para59"></a>Working men's clubs, which have huge numbers of members, are crucial. Many are located in remote areas, so it is important that the whole community, including both sexes, can meet there.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para60"></a>There have been heroic battles about the opening of club membership to women. In the case of the Oxford and Cambridge Club, it was the heads of colleges who won the battle. Rather like Iain Duncan Smith, they said that they would resign unless changes were made. In addition, I congratulate the Reform Club, which was among the pioneers of those changes. However, I once attended that club for lunch, after which my host was embarrassed to be told that, because I was among his guests, we would have to have our coffee in a tiny hidden room. Thank goodness that has all gone and the Reform Club was ahead of the game. I am glad that the Atheneum&#151;the natural haunt for top academics, scientists, medics and so forth&#151;after many debates has finally made the change, although it took a little time. The change happened only this year
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para61"></a>This Bill should not be necessary. However, given that legal requirement is now needed, I guess that within a very short time the fuss will die down. Given the rather different experience of life that women have, <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and what they can bring to the party as well as their economic input, power and influence which is growing everywhere, clubs will soon see that they are on to a good thing. The pity is that they were made to do it.

<A NAME="20313-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote. In 1975 she and I were founder members of the Equal Opportunities Commission. I was an ordinary member and she was the deputy chairman.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para62"></a>I need to declare interests in that I am a member of both the Reform Club, to which reference has just been made and which has admitted women on equal terms for 20 years, and of the Garrick Club, which does not admit women at all.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para63"></a>In many ways I know the Reform Club better because I have been a member for nearly 30 years and was chairman for two years in the early 1990s. I checked with the current secretary and understand that at the monthly election of new members at the present time, women come in as a proportion of the total new membership at around 25 to 30 per cent, as against 65 to 70 per cent of men. They come in on equal terms though it will take some time before the total membership is anywhere near equal. In fact at the present time, even after 20 years of equality with women, 85 per cent of the membership are men.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para64"></a> I believe the club has benefited immensely from taking women members and in my experience women often play a bigger role in the governance of the club than their share of the membership would suggest. The club currently has its second woman chairman.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para65"></a>On the other hand, the Garrick Club voted some years ago to continue to exclude women totally from membership. One of the major reasons was that, unlike many clubs such as the Atheneum, the Oxford and Cambridge and the Reform, the Garrick was never a purpose-built club. I have never understood that women were excluded from the main staircase, but those who have been there will agree that it is a relatively small club. It has an enormous waiting list. I waited for around seven years to be a member and the waiting list at the moment is still seven or eight years. One of the problems would be that if women were admitted to the club, it could only be meaningful if there was a positive discrimination admissions policy over a number of years, with the result that the men still on the waiting list would have to wait much longer.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para66"></a>I enjoy both my clubs. One is mixed and one is not. I am glad&#151;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will agree&#151;that this Bill does not seek to legislate out of existence such few men-only clubs as still remain. I am of course sympathetic to the idea that where women are in membership of a club, be it gentlemen's clubs, golf clubs or working men's clubs, they should have equal rights to the facilities and to a proper share of the governance, membership of the committees and so forth. But unlike other Members who have spoken so far, including the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, I am not at all keen on using the law to achieve that end.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para67"></a>Some clubs in practice&#151;examples have already been given&#151;have moved from being exclusively male to the other end of the spectrum, completely unisex by way of women being admitted with certain restrictions. Indeed, I recall that the Reform Club, for a short period 20-odd years ago after it admitted women, kept its smoking room, one of the main public rooms, for the exclusive use of male members. As will be appreciated, that was a sop to the old guard. Possibly it was necessary in order to get the vote for women members. The policy did not last very long.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para68"></a>Women who are associate members of the Oxford and Cambridge Club enjoy restricted use of certain facilities and pay a lower subscription, and they do not necessarily wish to alter that situation. That club may therefore move to a different set-up where it is completely mixed&#151;it may not&#151;but if the Bill is passed, certain clubs may prefer to remain exclusively male if they are not permitted to admit women on a limited or restricted basis, at least for the time being. So, if the Bill is passed in its present form, the law may perhaps be counter-productive.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para69"></a>Indeed, it may be counter-productive in another respect. If a club that already allows women members on an associated or restricted basis does not wish to be forced by the new law to give women completely equal rights, it might instead decide to revert to being exclusively male, which, as I understand it, the new Bill will permit. Many noble Lords who have spoken would not think that that was a positive and useful step forward but rather a step backwards.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para70"></a>Without law, clubs&#151;and I am talking about the types of clubs that I know best; the gentlemen's clubs, so-called&#151;have come a long way over the past 20 or 30 years. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, referred to some of the changes that have come about through social and other pressures, where perhaps a modest cluster of women eager to become members of clubs have managed to secure admission to and policy changes in the clubs concerned.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para71"></a>I doubt the value of a new law to cover what, after all, in 1975 was carefully determined as a distinction between private facilities, which are extensions of one's home and so on, and the provision of facilities and services which are publicly and/or commercially available. As I suggested, the law may be counter-productive and invite antagonisms that are otherwise gradually&#151;it may appear only gradually&#151;in the process of being reduced.

It is clearly a very important contribution to an on-going debate about the various ways in which women continue to be excluded from certain networks. I do not wish to make a long contribution because a great deal of what I wished to say has already been said.

<FONT SIZE=3>rules as arcane as anything the Bill is designed to address. Some might say that the Palace as a whole still retains at least some of the physical characteristics of the gentlemen's home from home that once it was. A brief glance into the Library after lunch will often bear that out.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para73"></a>However, that would be a superficial assessment, as we all know, because slowly but inexorably the building and its customs have changed, bowing to the recognition that men and women work and rest here together on equal terms and that the wishes of one group cannot be assumed to take precedence over the needs of another. If the House of Lords has been able to meet this challenge, surely it cannot be too much for others to contemplate.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para74"></a>Occasionally I visit the Garrick Club, which has been very much mentioned in the debate. I suspect&#151;in fact I believe I know for sure&#151;that the Garrick Club will not be caught by the terms of the Bill. I do not agree with my noble friend Lord Borrie that this is a good thing&#151;it is not. In common with my noble friend Lady Gale, I wish that clubs such as the Garrick were caught under this legislation. I hope that influence will be brought to bear on such clubs&#151;ultimately through the application of this legislation, but by other forms of pressure&#151;and will result in their no longer being able to act as they do.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para75"></a>I want to explain why I feel that way. It is germane to the debate. I am not a member of the Garrick Club because I cannot be a member&#151;which is odd. It has a very fine collection of paintings, as Members of this House who have attended the club&#151;and I am sure there are many&#151;will know. They are mostly paintings of people, several of whom are women who have been prominent in one of the professions with which this club has been especially associated&#151;the theatre&#151;which is also my profession. The club is named after an actor.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para76"></a>Women have had the freedom to be actors (if freedom it be&#151;only on the "equal misery for all" principle perhaps) since the end of the 17th century. That was long before they were allowed to be doctors, lawyers or Members of either House of Parliament. Of course, being an actor was for centuries regarded as only one step up from vagrancy or prostitution&#151;indeed, in some minds it still is&#151;but the theatre has always been an inclusive community, and women have long been honoured in it, as often as they have been reviled. How curious then that none of the string of eminent actresses from Sarah Siddons and Dora Jordan in the 18th century to Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith in our own time could have been, or can now be, members of a club that bears the name of one of their own kind.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para77"></a>A couple of years ago, one of my dearest friends had her birthday party at this same club. It was a lovely occasion, of course&#151;but my friend was in effect a guest at her own table. The fact that she was, and is, a senior member of the Government makes no difference&#151;she cannot be any kind of member of this club. Curiouser and curiouser, as Alice would say.

<P>

<a name="20313-08_para78"></a>The Bill does not, as I understand it, seek to prevent clubs or associations from choosing to recruit members exclusively from one gender group, provided that the benefits of membership are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be enjoyed wholly by men or wholly by women".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para79"></a>
 But that condition is clearly not met in the case of clubs such as the one I have mentioned, where the benefits are frequently enjoyed by both men and women, often together. Women are welcome guests, at least in my experience. They are treated with courtesy, sometimes even deference, by staff and members alike.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para80"></a>I have heard no complaints about this establishment, or about any of the several other clubs applying similar rules, from those fortunate enough to enjoy their hospitality from time to time. But being a guest, however hospitable the host, is very different from being at home. Apart from the necessity to be on one's best behaviour and not put elbows (or feet) on the table or fall asleep in front of the television and so on, as one might if one were at home, there is the constant awareness of being on the outside, excluded from the codes and discourses that come with belonging, whether to a club, a family or a profession, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, eloquently pointed out in respect of El Vino's. The way in which women were treated in that particular establishment was an issue of professional exclusion.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para81"></a>Knowing that one cannot aspire to anything other than guest status simply because one is a women is a singular and piquant kind of humiliation. I should be misleading your Lordships were I to suggest that it is at the top of the list of things that keep me awake at night; but periodically I wonder what it is that makes me a fit person, allegedly, to be a Member of this House but unfit for membership of the Garrick Club.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para82"></a>The Bill seeks to prevent the kind of discrimination which, however subtly or elegantly it manifests itself, perpetuates the notion that women can legitimately be sidelined or excluded from positions of influence. I am sure that many members of organisations applying such restrictions would regard these words as at best silly and at worst offensive. They would say that they have no such intentions&#151;that they are merely continuing in time-honoured fashion to do what has always been done. Along with my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester and many other speakers, I believe that this will no longer do. It is, as they say, the principle of the thing.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para83"></a>Although I recognise that what most irritates me about the way in which such clubs operate is not caught by the Bill, I none the less support it in the hope and belief that, if it is passed, it will begin to exert the kind of influence that will eventually mean that clubs such as the ones we have been discussing no longer operate the policies that they currently operate.

<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>welcome and long overdue amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. In doing so, I acknowledge the excellent work of Robert Walter MP on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para84"></a>As chair of the Women's National Commission, I am only too aware of the frustration, bewilderment and downright astonishment that many of our partner organisations feel at the current situation of women's second-class membership and third-rate treatment in a significant number of Britain's private clubs. They are clubs that allow women through the door, but do so with such grudging acceptance that an open-door policy actually means restricted membership&#151;restricted club times, restricted voting rights, restricted use of facilities, and more restrictions if one is a female guest.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para85"></a> A glance back at the past 24 months' of press coverage and surveys conducted on discrimination against women in private clubs reveals even to me a surprisingly strong and persistent set of prejudices against women in modern Britain. In April 2001, in the Daily Telegraph, Liz Khan stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At Royal Troon Golf Club women visitors can only play with a member of the club and women may not normally enter the clubhouse".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para86"></a>
She went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Royal and Ancient club house, home of golf, is barred to women and a few years ago, the Royal and Ancient, who offer all former male presidents of the United States Golf Association, honorary Royal and Ancient membership, gave Judy Bell, the first woman president of the United States Golf Association, not honorary membership, but a diamond brooch instead".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para87"></a>
In that instance, diamonds rather than men seemed to be a girl's best friend.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para88"></a>In March 2000, in the Daily Telegraph, Maurice Weaver reminded us that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Recently during refurbishment at a golf club in Worcestershire women were temporarily admitted to the men's bar and snooker room on condition that they did not cross a white line specially drawn on the floor. Men drank on one side of the white line/women on the other".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para89"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para90"></a>In normal times women would not have been allowed into the men's bar even to sell charity tickets. As other speakers have said, women are also barred from playing the course before noon on Sundays, 3 p.m. on summer Saturdays and 1 p.m. on winter Saturdays. As one woman said in the article,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It takes 3&#189; hours to get round the 18 holes, so on dark winter weekends it is practically impossible for women to get in a full round. The rule is so strictly enforced that women players are kept waiting for their start time, even though the tees are totally empty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para91"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para92"></a>As we have heard, however, not all clubs are as stone age in their thinking, and some have heeded the call by the Government and&#151;in earlier days&#151;by the EOC to reform their practices voluntarily. We welcome those more enlightened boards and echo John Morgan, General Secretary of the Penlan Social Club, in Swansea, whose 3,000 members&#151;as my noble friend Lord Faulkner reminds us&#151;voted two years ago to give women full membership. John Morgan said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Giving women full membership has made a big difference in terms of the dynamism of our club, we have a lot more going on now".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="column_929"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 929</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para94"></a> Yet too few clubs have taken the voluntary route to equality. In 1999, about three quarters of all private golf clubs retained extra privileges for male members, such as men's bars and banning women from playing the course at certain times. That is why the Bill is so timely in forcing through change and why we need the Government's support.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para95"></a>We live in times when diversity and equality should add up to a modern, forward-looking society. It is a great insult to today's modern women that so many private clubs operate on rules that are based on totally outmoded views of men's and women's lives, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, has said. There is the idea that women do not go out to work and, therefore, can use the golf course when men are out earning bread; that only men need the business, social and political networks that form the culture of many clubhouses; and that women must be kept away from the voting and decision-making machinery of a club at all costs&#151;perhaps in case they run them better.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para96"></a>A successful passage of this Bill will mean that if a club chooses to admit women it must admit them as equal members. That does not go far enough for my noble friend Lady McIntosh of Hudnall, whose concerns I understand, but it is a terrific start and one that I believe we must support. The Bill does not say that a club or an organisation cannot remain a single sex club. We do not expect to see, in the near future, muscle-bound men muscling in on the WI's next calendar.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para97"></a>The Bill applies to private member clubs of 25 or more members and it applies equally to discrimination against men. Like several noble Baronesses, I recently spoke on a Bill dealing with the need for political parties positively to encourage women to become members. In preparing for our debate I read that a pre-selection meeting was held at the Carlton Club for the 2001 general election. As we have heard, that club does not admit women as full members. The messages that many such clubs send out about their strong belief in women's inequality, not only damages the leisure and the sporting lives of many women, but also their working and political lives and ambitions. I wish my noble friend Lord Faulkner every success in his endeavours.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20313-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, like other speakers, I welcome the appearance of this excellent little Bill. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, on the extremely thorough way in which he introduced it.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para98"></a>I have never sympathised with the determination of some women, including noble Baronesses who have spoken in the debate, to close down all single-sex clubs. I have a sneaking suspicion that one day I may want to belong to a club that admits only women. From time to time there is a certain comfort in not having to get oneself dolled up because one is public, of being with other women and not having to make allowances for anyone else. I know that different views have been expressed.
<P>


<a name="column_930"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 930</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para99"></a>If both men and women are members of a club I support the idea that they should both have equal rights. That is the thesis at the heart of the Bill. I want to quote from a letter sent to my noble friend Lady Williams. The writer says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Many of the reasons for offering women different membership conditions are based on outdated views of men and women's lives such as assuming that women may be able to use club facilities during the day as they do not work, or that women will not want to use a club bar. At present the second class membership which women are offered excludes them from the business, political and social networks that the clubs offer. Women are also often prevented from being able to take part in the running of the clubs, meaning that they are not able to effect change from within".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para100"></a>
That final point is particularly effective. Other noble Lords have mentioned one or other of those points.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para101"></a>The key to this situation is that if one is to have associate members of a club with lesser access to the facilities, then those members should do a deal. They will presumably get fewer facilities for less money. But that should apply equally to men and women. The discrimination results from the fact that in general because full memberships are for the men and associate memberships are offered to women.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para102"></a>I have not been as hardworking as the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner. However, following a random sample of London's glamorous club land, I can now exclusively reveal that the Bill is causing different reactions in different clubs depending on their current position with respect to women members. We have already heard that for a long time clubs such as the Reform Club and the Liberal Club have had men and women on equal status. They are unconcerned because they are unaffected. One of the people with whom we spoke wondered whether in fact the equal status membership might have the effect&#151;this point was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie&#151;of forcing some clubs back into not offering any type of women's membership at all. Someone wondered whether men would dare to put women forward as full members of a man's club. It is a curious assumption that men are more lacking in courage than women.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para103"></a>This club&#151;the House of Lords&#151;let me in, but only because at the time when Paddy Ashdown was offered two peerages, after a very long period when he had not been offered any, he decided that he would choose one woman and one man. That is what he did. I hope that does not put me into a situation of not wanting to be a member of a club that would allow me to join.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para104"></a>Clubs that do not accept women as members differed in their approach when we talked to them. One interesting comment that we received was that it was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not right to prevent men or women from enjoying the full benefits of club membership, but equally not right to prevent men or women from enjoying the company of their own sex".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para105"></a>
That is the view I expressed at the beginning of my speech.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para106"></a> There was an interesting arrangement at the Army and Navy Club which responds very much to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh of Hudnall. That club was originally all male. Men and women now have equal access to membership if they <P>


<a name="column_931"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 931</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been officers in the armed services. Many women are now officers in the armed services. Even more interestingly, their spouses, whatever their sex, have equal rights to associate membership. As a result of taking a practical view of life, as the armed services so often do, the club has come up with precisely the result that the Bill seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para107"></a>Several noble Lords referred to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. This is the second small Bill that we have considered in this Session to modify that original and very breakthrough Act. It is a pity that we must go about it in this kind of "take a clause here and take a clause there" way, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para108"></a>I do not know how many noble Lords share my view that if there is no rational explanation of why women are not paid enough or do not have the same access to employment or any kind of right, the explanation is prejudice. It is as simple as that. I have fought that prejudice in my party&#151;someone spoke about party selection processes. The Act did not assist us in that, as we discovered when the Labour Party decided to go for all-women shortlists and was prosecuted under the Act. The most recent Act that we passed was directed precisely towards removing that danger. It does not remove all the dangers of positive action to promote women candidates, but it gets rid of that one. One could be prosecuted in a different way, if one were unlucky.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para109"></a>We cannot solve all of the world's problems or all women's problems with the Bill. It is to be hoped that we can make a good stab at solving the particular problems that the Bill addresses. I wish it well and hope that we will shortly hear from the Government Front Bench that they support it.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-08_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, it is late, so I will be brief. I begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for introducing the Bill, which gives us the opportunity to debate sex discrimination in private members' clubs. Let me also congratulate him on an excellent speech that illustrated by poignant examples the almost irresistible arguments in favour of the Bill. Let me also say that we are reticent about succumbing to legislation on the issue&#151;not because we do not believe in its aims but because the law can be a blunt instrument when used in such a way. We are therefore somewhat sceptical about inflicting legislation on how people choose to behave in private.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para110"></a>That said, we recognise that there is a serious need for a cultural change within some of our private institutions: a cultural change that is essentially about confronting closed minds. We recognise that the Bill is intended to meet that objective.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para111"></a>It is important, albeit at the risk of repetition, to make clear to all those beyond your Lordships' House who may not have read the Bill, what measures it would introduce. First and foremost, if a club chooses to admit women, it must admit them as equal members. Further, a single-sex club does not lose its <P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>status as a single-sex club if women are admitted to club functions on an occasional basis. Indeed, only if all the circumstances are such that the club cannot be genuinely described as single-sex does the Bill apply. Further, any club can choose to be or remain a single-sex club and the Bill applies only to private clubs with 25 or more members.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para112"></a> The Bill would outlaw, for example, single-sex bars where women were admitted to other bars in the club, golf clubs allowing women only at certain times and men-only enclosures. It would not outlaw, for example, single-sex changing rooms, gyms and lavatories. It would not outlaw single-sex sporting events&#151;thank goodness for that. Importantly, the Bill applies equally to discrimination against men.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para113"></a>In truth, I am not entirely convinced that the Bill as drafted will achieve those objectives in practice. Further consideration of its clauses in Committee will be essential before we decide whether it should reach the statute book. I agree with my noble friend Lady Fookes that the Bill is sensible in its approach and deserves serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para114"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, referred to the public stance taken by some of us in the Conservative Party, including me, who decided with a heavy heart to resign from the Carlton Club because it continues to exclude women members from full membership simply on grounds of sex. While it is a private club, the Carlton Club holds itself out to be a leading club of the Conservative Party&#151;a very public institution.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para115"></a>I was interested to learn that the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, resigned from the Garrick Club some years ago because he and others failed to persuade it to change the rules to admit women as members. I am somewhat surprised that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has failed to do likewise. I was also interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, seeking perhaps to defend the Garrick on the grounds of physical capacity. It reminded me of a biography of the Mitford girls that I read recently. The first Baron Redesdale, their father, argued in your Lordships' House that women should not be admitted as Members as there was no ladies' water closet close to the Chamber, in which case they would be inconvenienced. They are matters of principle.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para116"></a>I recall how in a debate in your Lordships' House last year on the lamentable lack of elected women Members of Parliament I felt that it was depressing that in the 21st century we should even be discussing the need to address issues concerning irrefutable discriminatory behaviour on grounds of sex. This evening, like the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, I feel equally depressed, although this Bill may at least cause some to re-think their attitudes. That said, we must tread carefully, as there is surely a limit to how much we should interfere with the rights of individuals acting in a private capacity.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para117"></a>I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say this evening. In particular, I would like to know whether the Bill will, as some newspaper reports have suggested, become a government Bill when it reaches another place. In that case, will it be taken out of <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20313-08_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to respond to this Second Reading debate and to join noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester for introducing the Bill and helping us to have this important debate.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para118"></a>During the debate I was particularly reminded of the sad case of private clubs covered by the Race Relations Act 1976. One of my former constituents in Preston was banned from entering the dockers' club on grounds of race. Occasionally, I thought, on the one hand, "Why are we debating this? Why don't we give up? It's all taking so long", but I do not think that a case of the kind that I have mentioned could occur now. Perhaps change will happen to the benefit of women.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para119"></a>The Government are firmly committed to equality of opportunity. Not only is it inherently right, but it is essential to Britain's future economic and social success. My honourable friend Barbara Roche, the Minister for Women, also welcomes the Bill in principle. Although the Government support the principles of the Bill, we must also consider the impact that it will have, as we do with all legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para120"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, I believe that the background to what has happened is extremely important. I was very taken by the thought of any conspiracy to cause mayhem and overthrow the rules that could bind together the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. I would have thought that they could privately conduct a conspiracy to deal with some of the issues that would not be covered by the Bill, were it to become law.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para121"></a>The SDA does not currently cover private clubs because it does not extend to the provision of goods, facilities and services that are private and of a personal nature. Private clubs fall within that category. The law was framed that way in the 1970s because it was felt that genuinely private members' clubs should be able to reflect their members' requirements and preferences and because of concerns about the impact that it might have on freedom of association. Over 25 years later, many private clubs now have both men and women as members but can lawfully restrict access to some or all facilities in that club to members of one sex. The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, raised that point with reference to golf clubs. Other noble Lords referred to the assumption that women could play only during the week and the difficulty that that presented for working women who could play only during peak hours at weekends.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para122"></a>Many working men's and constitutional clubs deny full membership benefits or refuse access by making the position impossible, uncomfortable or unpleasant, as my noble friend Lady Gale described. This kind of sex discrimination by private clubs is not acceptable. If <P>


<a name="column_934"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 934</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clubs allow both sexes access to membership and some facilities and benefits, there can be no justification for them doing so in a discriminatory way.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para123"></a> My noble friends Lord Faulkner and Lady Crawley referred to the previous calls for the Government to change sex discrimination legislation. Many women have also written in individually. As my noble friend said, in 1998 the EOC proposed that the SDA should be extended to apply to clubs which have men and women members. The Government responded then by indicating a preference for voluntary action to be taken by clubs to eliminate discriminatory practices before imposing a legislative duty.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para124"></a>Several years later, very little has been done to rectify this inequality. Our expectation that clubs with both male and female members would want voluntarily to make sure that their arrangements were not discriminatory was, sadly, not borne out. I understood some reservations put forward by my noble friend Lord Borrie, but how long do we have to wait for voluntary action to provide that equality within the membership of clubs?
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para125"></a>My noble friend Lady Crawley referred to the fact that many clubs have less equal memberships available&#151;usually offered solely to women. Noble Lords have questioned whether there is any possibility of such clubs changing their minds. I suspect that in some cases the decision to allow women to become associate members may be associated with the fact that associate membership often involves a payment of money to help to support the club. I suspect that a club's finances might be quite severely affected were it suddenly to try&#151;even if legally it could&#151;to revert back to being male only. I know that that would be the case with some of the clubs in the CIU. I say to my noble friend Lady Gale that there may be hope of change.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para126"></a>I join my noble friend Lady Crawley in paying tribute to the work done in the past by Robert Walter and his attempt to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. There was a spate of misleading articles which said that the Government wanted to ban men-only clubs. I can give an assurance that my noble friend does not have this intention. The Government have made no criticism of genuine single-sex clubs.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para127"></a>As my noble friend Lady Gale said, we do not hear complaints about single-sex clubs such as the Women's Institute, the Girl Guides or Business and Professional Women UK. Nor would one expect to hear complaints about support groups for male single parents or for men who are the primary carers of pre-school children within a family. We know that the general public would not want such groups banned, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, recognised.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para128"></a>To respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, we are focusing on new legislation to combat discrimination in employment on the grounds of age, sexual orientation and religion. We do not believe that the important issue is the introduction of a single <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>equality Bill. We are committed to eradicating discrimination and to providing clarity and coherence. We do not believe that this is the time for a fundamental review of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para129"></a> My noble friend Lady McIntosh spoke of hope and belief. We hope that the Bill, with some amendments, would in principle lead to an improvement in the situation. As virtually all those who have spoken have recognised, it would require members' rights to be equal if men and women were both in membership of the same club.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para130"></a>There is no question that the inequalities that persist among mixed-sex clubs are out of date and contrary to the Government's principles of equal opportunity for all. My noble friend Lady Gale and the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Buscombe, know that we were all delighted by the passing of the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002. Virtually all those who have taken part tonight recognise that that is the beginning of securing equality for women in consideration for candidature. It is enabling legislation that does not impose anything on the political parties. We all need to go away and start undermining the system again. Perhaps we could get advice from the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and be prevented from being taken to court by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, working with her.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para131"></a>I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that we support the principles that the Bill embodies. There is some important work to be done to ensure that it does what it is intended to do&#151;and only what it is intended to do. As the noble Baroness said, addressing discrimination by private clubs raises some sensitive issues and requires a delicate balance between the rights and wishes of one group against those of another. The Government will welcome the views of noble Lords at later stages.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para132"></a>Finally, I was asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, about government time for the Bill. There are established procedures and time available for Private Members' Bills to progress. I have set out that the Government's support for the Bill is qualified and some changes will need to be made to allow the Government to give their full support. That said, we shall of course listen to representations at the appropriate time, should the Bill pass this House and be picked up in another place. However, we have a packed legislative programme, so I cannot give assurances. Perhaps I should conclude by quoting again my noble friend Lady McIntosh&#151;we must all have hope.

<A NAME="20313-08_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I am most appreciative of every contribution, I hoped that my Bill would receive some support but the overwhelming support in all parts of the House is most touching and I appreciate it.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para133"></a>As the hour is late, I will not pick up every point. If the Bill receives a Second Reading, we will have the opportunity to consider such matters in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para134"></a>My noble friend Lady Gale told the horror story of the Welsh club in the by-election, then referred to the Cardiff and County Club and asked whether the Bill would cover the way that guests are treated there. The answer is yes. Clause 1(4), (5) and (6) deal with exactly that situation. If guests are admitted to a single-sex club, they are to be treated on an equal basis.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para135"></a>My noble friend Lady Farrington, in a contribution that I particularly appreciated, picked up my point about how long we should wait. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, made the same point and was modest enough not to refer to a quote of her own in the Daily Telegraph piece on 2nd April 2001 to which my noble friend Lady Crawley referred:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In 1978, Lady Howe,"

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-08_para137"></a><P>

<a name="20313-08_para138"></a>That was 24 years ago and is the answer to my noble friend Lord Borrie. Perhaps the time for waiting is over and the time for legislating is here. I appreciated my noble friend's contribution. His was the odd one out and I hope that he will argue his points in Committee. I am afraid that I disagreed with much of what he said&#151;and believe that many of your Lordships did as well.
<P>

<a name="20313-08_para139"></a> We had a good tour of most London clubs and visited some golf clubs and working men's clubs. The general picture that emerged was that it is time for the law to be changed. I am happy to listen to my noble friend Lady Farrington, as I always am, when she suggests change and amendment. I hope that we will be able to agree on a raft of amendments that will make the Bill entirely acceptable to the Government and to the Opposition. I appreciated also the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and was pleased that she referred to her own brave experience with the Carlton Club&#151;which I am sure was appreciated in all parts of the House.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Ampthill) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in the Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para0"></a>I should explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para1"></a>Title postponed.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para2"></a>Clause 1 [Paternity leave]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-09_para3"></a><P>

<a name="20313-09_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: Before moving Amendment No. 1 in my name and Amendment No. 2 also in my name and that of my noble friends Lady Miller and Lord Rotherwick, perhaps I may say a word about the Bill being in Grand Committee. When I was part of the usual channels, I was part of the process whereby agreements were done under which Bills of one sort or another were sent to the Moses Room or, rather, into Grand Committee. The original idea behind that process was that certain Bills might be dealt with more appropriately in Grand Committee rather than on the Floor of the House. I understand that this was the case particularly where the Bill was very complicated, or highly technical, but the process was also designed for those Bills that were not controversial. It was always understood that it was not designed simply to make life easier for the Government, or for the Government to get their own legislation through and to get more of it through.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para5"></a>I am no longer part of the usual channels but the procedure does not seem to apply to this Bill. First, it is a big Bill with five clauses, eight schedules and a total of 82 pages. I do not believe it is an uncontroversial <P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill, particularly, dare I say it, on the Minister's own Benches, where there is a degree of controversy about it.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para6"></a>I understand that deals have been done and it is right and proper that that is the case in certain circumstances. I also understand that all of us have benefited from that in that it has allowed us to have that extra bit of paternity leave to spend more time with our families over half term. That was part of the deal that was done through the usual channels to ensure that the Bill went into Grand Committee. I put on the record&#151;I imagine that there will be others who will agree with me&#151;that the Bill is not particularly appropriate for a Grand Committee. I appreciate that it is difficult to get it right and that we all make mistakes. I remember an education Bill with which my noble friend Lady Blatch was involved that went into Grand Committee; again, I suspect that that was not appropriate for that Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para7"></a>Moreover, if a Bill is to be in Grand Committee it is an improvement for us to sit in this Committee Room rather than in the Moses Room. Others might have different views on that.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para8"></a>I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together. The amendments relate to the new provisions in the Bill for statutory paternity leave and statutory paternity pay, about which I expressed some concerns at Second Reading. Before I turn to the amendments themselves, perhaps I can go back a little and say what I said at Second Reading. I ask the Government to say a little more about why those measures are being introduced. What is the need and where is the demand? Are there potential fathers up and down the country demanding that they must have two weeks or whatever of paternity leave so that they can bond with their new children? Are these not matters that are far better and more sensibly left to informal arrangements between employer and employee? For example, an employee might ask if he can take the afternoon off to take his wife home from hospital after the birth of the child, or whatever. Is not that preferable to having the heavy hand of the law saying that the employer must give the employee at least two weeks off, whether it is convenient to the employer or not, simply because the father wants to? The convenience of the employer is something that can be taken into account, as we shall see in relation to later provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para9"></a>Can the Minister tell us on what basis the Government are introducing this proposal and what research and consultation preceded it? Exactly what was the reaction of employers to the measure? Will he also say something about the extra burden that is being imposed on business, particularly small businesses? As I said at Second Reading, big employers can often cope very easily with such matters. It is no hardship to them at all. They have no objection to taking on such measures, but for a smaller employer losing one key worker at a crucial stage can be very difficult.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para10"></a>Secondly, can the Minister say what research the Government will do in the future into the effectiveness of this measure? How many fathers will take it up and at what cost? I believe that the figures for average <P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>earnings are around &#163;18,000 or &#163;19,000 per year, or &#163;400 per week. If they are at about that level, how many fathers will want to take two weeks off on greatly reduced pay at a time when household expenses have dramatically increased? They are more likely to be asking the employer for overtime, rather than time off.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para11"></a>Amendment No. 2, to which my noble friends have also signed up, is designed to achieve one thing. We are told that fathers are being given two weeks. Mothers now have a year's maternity leave&#151;six months paid and then six months unpaid. With the Bill drafted as it is, the two-week period could be extended bit by bit. No doubt there are bodies and organisations that represent fathers. I am sure that they do not represent fathers, but that will not stop them claiming to do so and demanding on grounds of equality or parity with mothers an extension of that two-week period. Gradually demands will be made for two, three and four weeks and, finally, dare I say it, for 26 weeks' paid leave and 26 weeks' unpaid. What was originally intended as a minor and, in my view, totally unnecessary, irritant becomes a major burden on the employer. I believe that if the period is to be extended beyond two weeks, it should be done by primary rather than secondary legislation. Therefore, perhaps I may have an assurance from the Government that there is no present intention to extend the two-week period and that they will not extend that period unless they can show that there are seriously good reasons for doing so and a serious demand from outside, both from potential parents and employers.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para12"></a>As I understand it, new Section 80A(4) mentions the period of 56 days&#151;that is, eight weeks. Does that mean that a power exists only to extend the period from two weeks to a maximum of 56 days and that there would not be a power to extend it beyond that limit? I am not sure whether that is a correct interpretation of the subsection, but no doubt the Minister will reassure me on that point.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para13"></a>While on the subject of this new section, perhaps I may ask whether the Minister will take the opportunity to explain two subsections to me. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations under subsection (1) may . . . (a) specify things which are, or are not, to be taken as done for the purpose of caring for a child or supporting the child's mother".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-09_para14"></a>
I wonder whether the noble Lord can tell me what that means and what exactly he intends the regulations to cover in relation to that section. It is not clear to me.
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para15"></a>The same is true of subsection (5)(c), which makes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provision about how leave under this section may be taken".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-09_para16"></a>
Again, when we are talking about two weeks' leave, I am not sure why it is necessary for provision to be made about how that leave should be taken. I understand that the two weeks' leave, which we shall come to later when we deal with the subject of paternity pay, is to be taken either in a two-week block or in two sections of one week. With those questions, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My noble friend knows that we do not support his amendment, although we <P>


<a name="column_CWH4"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agree with the concept of paternity leave. The amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 2, to which I was happy to put my name. In particular because this is an enabling Bill, I believe that it is important that there should be some element of precision. When the Bill states "at least two weeks", it means that the Secretary of State could fulfil the requirements if she stipulated in the order a period of three weeks, four weeks or even two months. It is important that that is clear and that people know exactly what we are talking about. The idea of issuing a blank cheque like this is taking the blank cheque system a little too far. That is why I should like to restrict it by removing the words "at least".
<P>

<a name="20313-09_para17"></a>The Bill was first presented to Parliament over four months ago, having been preceded by fairly extensive consultation, including with the unions. I believed that by now the Government would have formed a view as to what they expected the period to be. If they have not done so, that seems rather vague. In particular, the Bill cannot be left with one of its major provisions&#151;indeed, this is the number one provision&#151;remaining very vague. Unless and until the Government can make up their mind and enlighten us what their intentions are in primary legislation, it may be better if we try to help to concentrate their mind by limiting the leave to two weeks.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  First, we did consult extensively, including a formal consultation of 12 weeks on the Green Paper, Work and Parents. We also consulted specifically for a further 12 weeks on the detailed framework for paternity leave. It turned out that many people wanted to have paternity leave and to be present during the early stages of their children's life. He may even have felt, during his children's early days, a faint twinge that he might like to be with them some time.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para0"></a>Let me deal with some specific points. The amendments would have the effect of taking the period of paternity leave out of regulations and making it fixed on the face of the Bill for a period of exactly two weeks. As things stand, the Bill makes it clear that regulations will provide that leave will be for a minimum of two weeks.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para1"></a>If the noble Lord is concerned that we may regulate to allow a period longer than two weeks, let me reassure him that that is not our intention. We have consulted extensively and exhaustively on this subject, both in the Work and Parents Green Paper and subsequently. I will not say that the proposal for a two-week period met absolutely universal approval&#151;inevitably, some wanted a longer period and others wanted a shorter period, but we needed to strike a balance and two weeks represents a reasonable consensus.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para2"></a>Having said that, we could of course fix the period firmly on the face of the Bill and leave ourselves no possibility of ever changing it by regulations. I do not see the need for that. As so often, in this aspect of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH5"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>paternity provisions we are mirroring the architecture of the maternity provisions. In those provisions, the length of pay is a matter for primary legislation but the length of leave is a matter for regulations. I do not say it could not be done differently but, historically, it has not been done differently and I do not believe that causes problems&#151;provided, of course, that we are clear what those regulations will say, so that employers know the extent of their liability and employees know the extent of their entitlement well in advance.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para3"></a>I cannot rule out the possibility, over time, that the Government might want to look again at the issue of the length of leave. It could happen, but it is not our current intention. The period of paid paternity leave will be two weeks and, with that assurance, I hope that the noble Lord is prepared to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I shall not withdraw the amendment just yet because I have a number of concerns that have not been addressed. I think that I am right in understanding that I have had an assurance from the Minister that the length of pay is a matter for primary legislation. If the noble Lord would extend that by primary legislation, the length of leave could be extended by secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para4"></a>The Minister has not addressed my concern about the 56-day period. In the provision, the noble Lord will see that leave must be taken before the end of the period&#151;at least 56 days is involved&#151;beginning with the date of the child's birth. If that is the case, that would mean that he could not extend the two-week period beyond 56 days without primary legislation. So two weeks' leave could, by secondary legislation, only be extended up to eight weeks' leave. Any extension of leave beyond eight weeks would therefore have to be done through primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para5"></a>Moreover, the Minister has not addressed my concerns about the meaning of the regulations in subsection (5), particularly paragraphs (a) and (c). I would be very grateful if he would take say exactly what can be expected in the regulations under paragraphs (a) and (c) in particular.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   We have put 56 days on the face of the Bill but, as I understand it, we could by regulation extend it beyond that period in particular circumstances, if we so wished.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I cannot accept that. If the requirement was that leave had to be taken before the end of a period of at least 56 days beginning with the date of the child's birth, that would mean that they would not be able to complete an extension of the period of leave beyond eight weeks in a period of 56 days. In other words, either the Bill is badly drafted or there is a limit on what the Government can do by means of regulation. Obviously, the 56-day period cannot be changed by means of secondary legislation because that was there in the Bill, unless it was shown in some other part of the Bill as something different. I <P>


<a name="column_CWH6"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want to ensure here that the Government know what they are doing, in terms of the power they are trying to give themselves to extend that particular period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The situation is as I explained to the noble Lord; that we could in regulations extend the period further. However, I shall take this point away and check whether there is confusion in the drafting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord and perhaps between now and Report stage he could write to me and take advice from his lawyers about the drafting of that particular point. Before we leave, perhaps the noble Lord might address my questions about subsection (5)(a) and subsection (5)(c) in terms of the precise meaning of those pages and what is intended to be in the regulations under subsections (5)(a) and (5)(c).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Paternity leave is for the purpose of caring for the mother and supporting the child and subsection (5)(a) allows us to detail what we mean by that. We do not expect to make use of powers, as stated in our memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Select Committee. However, we have left ourselves with the opportunity, in case we discover over time that abuses are occurring and we need to be more precise about that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   It seems extraordinary that the regulations might, for instance, provide that someone could go home to look after his wife or partner but that he cannot go to watch Arsenal play at wherever. I would have thought that it was not necessary for the heavy hand of the state come into it. If you are going to give someone parental leave, why can they not just go home and take it? No doubt, however, the noble Lord can consider that and let me know any further thoughts he may have. Having said all that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para7"></a>[Amendment No. 2 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-10_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 35, at end insert "(in which case reference in this section to the date of the child's birth shall mean the date of the still birth)"
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20313-10_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 3 is intended to clarify an omission or an ambiguity in the Bill. It was previously proposed in the other place by my honourable friend, the Member for Runnymead and Weybridge. As he pointed out, at the same time as referring to the date of the birth of the child, subsection (7) of the new Section 80A refers to a stillborn child. Although paternity leave is provided for in such a tragic case, it is not to enable the father to help care for the child, but to enable him to support the bereaved mother. It is, however, not absolutely clear that the reference to the date of the child's birth also includes the date of the stillbirth.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para10"></a>In response to the probing amendment of my honourable friend, the Minister for Employment and the Regions referred at my honourable friend's request to the Social Security Contributions Act 1992 and specifically to Section 171. It states, and I precis, that confinement means labour after 28 weeks of pregnancy resulting in the birth of a child whether alive or dead.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para11"></a>The Minister admitted, after further questioning from my honourable friend, that he was "fairly confident" that maternity pay for the full period under that Act would apply in the case of stillbirth. Presumably, by analogy, the Minister would be "fairly confident" that the date of the stillbirth would be taken as the same as the date of a live birth. However, "fairly confident" is not enough.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para12"></a>The Minister promised to review the matter but in the intervening stages in the other place, no clarification has emerged. That is why it is necessary for me to bring this amendment back for your Lordships to consider. This is not a controversial matter. We are all agreed on the objective and support the inclusion of the case of a stillborn child in the right to paternity leave.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para13"></a>What is required, however, is absolute clarity on the face of the Bill. This Bill will be referred to by both employers and employees to ascertain the employees' rights. Often, indeed usually, they will not have the benefit of expert advice. It is important that an employer or an employee, acting alone, should be able to go to their local library, or gain access to the Internet, or in some other manner to look at a copy of the Act and see what their rights are.
<P>

<a name="20313-10_para14"></a>Acceptance of the amendment does not involve any changes whatever in the Bill. It does not diminish the Bill or parental rights in any way at all. It is not acceptable for the Minister to say, if that is what he has mind, that the amendment is not necessary. It may not be necessary for him, for lawyers, trade union advisers or other experts who have expertise at construing statutes. It also has to be clear to the owner of a corner shop or to the director of a small manufacturing business, without the time or the money to spend on professional advice. Above all, it also has to be clear to the father of a stillborn child who will have quite enough to contend with without his having to hunt around at such a distressing time to find out what his rights are. My amendment is simply to clarify the Act without altering it in any way. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="20313-11_para0"></a>I understand the concern that lies behind the amendment. We all agree that it is right that the entitlement of paternity leave should not be lost in the event of stillbirth where the need for the father to take time off, if only to support the mother, is very clear.

<a name="20313-11_para1"></a>However, the amendment is not necessary. The Employment Rights Act 1996 into which the relevant provisions on paternity leave are inserted states at Section 235(1) that in the Act,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'childbirth' means the birth of a living child or birth of a child whether living or dead after twenty-four weeks of pregnancy."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-11_para2"></a>
The birth of a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy will therefore count as the "birth of a child" for the purposes of eligibility, whether that child is born living or dead.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para3"></a>In those circumstances, the situation is clear because of where it fits into the Employment Rights Act 1996. I therefore hope the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   As a point of clarification, what happens if the child dies after three weeks? Would that be covered by this provision?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It has to be after the 24 weeks of pregnancy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   But what if the child went to full term and died after three weeks of being born?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Yes, in those circumstances, entitlement would continue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I was quite hopeful at the beginning of the Minister's reply when he said the amendment was not needed. That is a different word from "not necessary". I thought he would continue to say that as it does not alter the Bill we might as well leave it out. I never yet had the pleasure of such a problem with the Minister. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20313-11_para7"></a><P>

<a name="20313-11_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The group of amendments we are considering here reverts in the main to an issue which we discussed at some length in the other place, and which was left unresolved. That issue is the circumstance in which an employer is liable to pay paternity pay to an employee, and whether that liability continues even when the employee has moved on and left that employer's employment at some point before the child is born and any payment comes to be made.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para9"></a>There is no disagreement about the fundamental policy intention; namely, that it would not be right for an employer to be responsible for making payments to a former employee who had left his employment some time ago. The issue under discussion was whether the Bill as currently drafted gave proper effect to that intention and the Government undertook to go away and examine whether amendments were needed to give effect to that policy.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para10"></a>Given our policy intention, several Members expressed concern about the phrases in the Bill that seemed to them ambiguous or even misleading; namely, that the employee should have "ceased to work" for his employer and there might be circumstances where a person not just who is an employee, but who "has been" an employee, could qualify for paternity pay from the employer. I am not surprised that the noble Baroness has returned to the charge by laying amendments to delete or modify these phrases.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para11"></a>Now that we have examined the Bill closely in the light of the concerns raised earlier in the other place, she will see that we agree with her. In this case, we believe that some amendments are necessary to correct the situation. Indeed, as she can see, we go rather beyond her in our view of the amendments that are needed. I hope that, once I have explained matters a little further, she will therefore agree to withdraw her amendments and agree to the Government's, which effectively subsume those she has tabled.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para12"></a>The package of amendments tabled in my name establishes unambiguously that an employee will be entitled to statutory paternity pay from an employer only if he is working for that employer up to the date of birth or placement of the child, and not if he has left his employment at some point beforehand. In making this crystal clear, various consequential amendments are required to maintain internal consistency, and I would like now briefly to go through the amendments in turn.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para13"></a>Amendments to lines 31, 37, 42, 44 and 45 on page 5 and lines 2, 5 and 6 on page 6 make clear that, in the case of paternity pay on the birth of a child, an employee must continue to be employed by his employer between the end of the "relevant week" and the date of birth itself. In this case, the relevant week is the week immediately preceding the 14th week before the expected week of childbirth, in other words the week when he must give his employer notice of his intention to take paternity leave. Amendments to lines 27, 28 and 32 make equivalent provision for paternity leave in the case of adoption, where the relevant week is necessarily expressed differently.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para14"></a>Amendments to line 31 on page 5 and line 13 on page 6, as with those tabled by the noble Baroness, delete references to a person who "has been" an employee qualifying for paternity pay, since, as I have said, at the time his entitlement crystallises he will necessarily still be in employment.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para15"></a>Amendments to line 37 on page 5, lines 19, 23, 33 and 45 on page 6 remove references to an "expected" child, since entitlement for paternity pay will crystallise on the birth or placement of a child, not beforehand. This does not, of course, affect the fact that notice of intention to take both leave and pay must be given in advance.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para16"></a>Amendment to line 33 on page 8 ensures that the requirement that pay (like leave) should be available only where the employee is taking time off work for the purpose of supporting the mother or caring for the child, which would otherwise have been lost from the drafting, is reinstated elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para17"></a>Amendments to line 36 on page 6, line 15 on page 7 and line 2 on page 8 make consequential amendments to cross-references.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para18"></a>Amendments clarify that payment is by reference to a clearly defined "statutory pay week", where the current draft of the Bill might otherwise be seen as slightly confusing in that it refers in one place to a pay "week" and in another to a pay "period".
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para19"></a>Finally, the amendment to lines 34 to 36 on page 8, which subsumes the noble Baroness's amendment to line 34 on page 8, tidies up subsection (4) of the new Section 171ZE. The policy intention is to regulate in a way which mirrors the existing statutory maternity pay legislation in this area. The relevant statutory adoption pay provisions (subsections (3) to (5) of new Section 171ZN) achieve this and we propose amending the statutory paternity pay provisions in Section 171ZE(4) to make them similarly consistent.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para20"></a>The noble Baroness may have noted that the government amendments do not take account of her proposed amendment to line 15 on page 15, to the adoption provisions of the Bill in Clause 4. This is because I do not think the amendment is right. The policy intention in respect of adoption pay is different from that in respect of paternity pay, but is consistent with that in respect of maternity pay.
<P>

<a name="20313-11_para21"></a>We believe that once an employee's entitlement to adoption pay has crystallised at the point of matching with a child, that entitlement should not be lost, even if he or she leaves employment&#151;for example, resigning to become a full-time parent. In these circumstances, a mother does not lose her maternity pay and I do not think that an adopter should lose their adoption pay. The words "ceased to work", which the amendment seeks to remove, perform the double function of covering both this sort of situation and the perhaps more usual circumstance where the employee merely takes leave from work with the intention of returning. The words are therefore appropriate as they are in the equivalent provisions for maternity pay. On that basis, the amendment is subsumed in the general position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, perhaps he could help me on one matter. We are dealing with a very large number of proposed amendments, and especially government amendments, which are likely to be written into the Bill. I refer to Amendments Nos. 4 to 26, 28 to 32, <P>


<a name="column_CWH11"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and 36. Those who are interested in the matter&#151;and many people are interested in the progress of this Bill, such as employers and representatives of workers too&#151;will be interested especially in what my noble friend said about adoption pay. That struck me as being most important. Those who have not ventured into the Himalayas and climbed to hear the proceedings of this Grand Committee, and who do not have this document which sets out all the amendments, will be quite mystified. Would he arrange to have all these amendments printed in Hansard&#151;to have all of the amendments printed in Hansard? Then those who are trying to follow his speech on this and subsequent matters will be able to read the public instrument of the proceedings of the Committee and be able to put the Bill together.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I believe that Hansard will have these automatically and immediately and people will be able to see them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister, for those new amendments, which certainly have dealt with most of the amendments that I have put down in this group. The Minister may be interested to know that, through a technical hitch, and it is no more than that, I asked for Amendments Nos. 5, 9, 15 and 36 to be withdrawn, but somehow that was not done and they are still on the Marshalled List. I have no intention of moving them.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para0"></a>However, in this group, I still have Amendment No. 30. Unless I am very mistaken, I do not think the Minister has quite dealt with that problem for me. With the leave of the Committee, I would like to mention my concern about Amendment No. 30. This is a probing amendment to enable us to find out exactly what the Government mean by a phrase. On page 8, line 34, we have asked them to leave out:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Except in such cases as may be prescribed"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-12_para1"></a>
I really wanted some information as to what those cases might be.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para2"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked the identical question in the other place, but no answer came there at all. We believe that clarification is needed on the issue of when the Secretary of State expects to prescribe what statutory paternity pay should be payable to a person who works under a contract of service. Conversely, perhaps the Minister can explain why statutory paternity pay will therefore not be payable in those circumstances, whatever they might happen to be. That is not at all clear.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para3"></a>The Minister for Employment Relations and the Regions said that the Government have an amendment on that issue somewhere down the line. I have not been able to find it. It may very well be there and would make my amendment unnecessary. I would therefore agree with the noble Lord, if that is what he said. However, I have to say that I have not seen it and, looking at the clause, it is still in its original state with those words.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH12"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para4"></a>The Minister said that a person cannot work and receive benefit at the same time. Precisely. So why are the Government asking for power to make an exception to that common sense statement by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such cases as may be prescribed"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-12_para5"></a>
The Minister suggested that there was some analogy with maternity leave, but there is no indication of what happens in that case. Lastly, the Minister said that we are trying to keep our options open for exceptional circumstances that may arise. That is definitely the most blank of blank cheques.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para6"></a>The Government want powers to make exceptions against the financial interests of employers in certain circumstances but they cannot even give us the most fanciful examples that the entire department's fertile imagination could dream up; such examples might have indicated to us in some way what that was supposed to mean. I believe that the truth is that the draftsman let his pen run away with him when he put these words in the clause without specifically knowing what he had in mind. There is enough waffling on this subject in the other place&#151;it went on for quite some time&#151;and I was hoping that in this House we might have a little more precision from the Minister.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para7"></a>The Government did not come up with the amendment that they predicted, presumably by way of clarification, perhaps because they cannot. Two months have passed since the debate in the other place and the time has come for the Government either to come up with something else or to drop these words.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Perhaps I may pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. The Minister said that all the amendments in this group would be printed in Hansard together with Amendment No. 4. The normal form would in fact be that Amendment No. 4 would be printed just before the Minister's speech. Amendments Nos. 5 to 26, excluding those that are not going to be moved by my noble friend, would appear when they were moved; that is, after the debate on this amendment. Amendments Nos. 28 to 32 would then have to be moved after our debate on Amendment No. 27; that is when they would appear. Amendment No. 36 would obviously come after the debate on Amendment Nos. 33 and 35. Is he suggesting that he will depart from the usual procedure and, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, asked, print them together, before they were moved, with Amendment No. 4? That would be helpful and make the position much easier to understand. That is the relevant procedure. Is that what he was implying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   No, I said that those employers who wanted to look through Hansard and see what had been said would be able to go through the amendments and see them in that context. That was all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Employers will not be able to do that unless we do not do what my noble friend Lord Wedderburn was told would be done and the Government also do not do what the noble Lord, Lord <P>


<a name="column_CWH13"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Henley, suggested. Is the Minister saying that the amendments will be moved at the end of this debate, as is done in the other place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Yes, is the answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   The answer is that the amendments will appear in Hansard but that they will be quite difficult to find. They will not appear in the easy manner that was asked for by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn although we seemed to get a response suggesting that they would all appear with Amendment No. 4.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Within two weeks the Bill will be reprinted for Report with the amendments as agreed in Committee. That is what people outside will be looking for and that will be much easier to understand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   We were seeking clarity for those listening to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, to make sure that we all understood exactly what was going to appear in Hansard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The drafting is entirely consistent on this point. The noble Baroness referred to the maternity provisions, which relate to a woman who has two part-time jobs and qualifies for pay from both. In some circumstances she is able to work for an employer while getting maternity pay from the other, and we are replicating that point here.

<a name="20313-12_para34"></a><P>

<a name="20313-12_para35"></a>The noble Lord said: We can deal with this amendment briefly. I wish to seek some assurances from the Government, but I also want to point them in another direction. First, now that we are dealing with the section of the Bill concerned with paternity pay, am I correct in saying that it can only be paid, as the Bill sets out, for a period of either two weeks or one week, as the employee wishes? If that is true of statutory paternity pay, I presume that the same must be true of paternity leave. I also presume that that leave can be taken only at the same time as the paternity pay is given and that it cannot be taken, as was suggested earlier, in a series of 10 days spread out over 56 days. I should be grateful for an assurance from the Minister on that point because we need to have it on the record.
<P>

<a name="20313-12_para36"></a>The second point behind the amendment is that this is another extra, and I would argue unnecessary, burden on the employer. It is one of those occasions where one might give the employer a little back in return and suggest that his agreement be sought if paternity leave and paternity pay were to be taken over two non-consecutive weeks rather than two weeks at a time. That might make a difference to him. Again, I am thinking of a small employer who may lose a key employee. It is one of those occasions where a degree of consultation between employer and employee might be the answer. If the words "if agreed with the employer" were included, that might at least give the right message about how this new burden should be interpreted in terms of relations between employer and employee. I beg to move.

When we talk about two weeks' pay, it is actually two weeks' pay, not three days, then four days, another three days and then another two days or whatever. The early part of the Bill states "a week or seven days". I take it that the option is between 14 days or seven days. Thus, the employee's pay would be for a week of seven days or a period of 14 days. That is not clear in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Before the Minister responds, in reply to the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, my understanding is that statutory paternity pay can be paid to an employee who either takes two weeks off at a particular point or takes a week off followed by another week some time later. If that extra burden is to be placed on the employer&#151;that is, of an employee taking not only two weeks off but two separate periods of one week&#151;there should be a degree of consultation with the employer. I should like to see even greater consultation with the employer. However, this small amendment asks the Government to think about allowing the employer to consult a little more with the employee. It is possible that I have misunderstood that point. If that is the case, no doubt the Minister will advise me and I shall return to it at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para0"></a>As I implied, the amendment was also designed as a probing amendment in order to obtain an assurance from the Government that pay and leave would cover a period of only two weeks, taken either as one two-week block or as two single weeks at separate times but not as a series of days taken off according to whether Arsenal were playing away or whatever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The amendment states "if agreed", not "after consultation". "After consultation" is one thing; "if agreed" is a veto.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   It might be a veto. If the noble Lord does not like it, perhaps I could bring in some degree of consultation with the employer and then a whole range of arbitration as appropriate. You can lengthen the Bill yet further; I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, would like that. I believe this is one occasion where the employee is getting something&#151;he is getting a right to two weeks&#151;so why not at least say that the employer can say, "I am terribly sorry, you cannot take it as two one-week blocks but you can have your right of two weeks all at once if you so wish"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   We need not debate too much where the provision appears, although the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, is probably right because we simply do not agree with the amendment. Let me explain why.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para1"></a>This amendment seeks to institutionalise discussion and agreement between the employer and employee over some of the ways in which it may be possible for paternity pay to be taken.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para2"></a>I am not unsympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment. I believe it is absolutely right that there should be discussion in the workplace well before the leave is taken, so that employer and employee have the best possible common understanding of the position. I know that such discussions are already common in many workplaces where paternity benefits are provided as a contractual matter, and I would not want to see any lesser emphasis placed on such discussions in respect of the new statutory rights.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para3"></a>However, it would be immensely difficult to provide that a particular potential flexibility which we have now introduced into the Bill&#151;namely the possibility that regulations will allow an employee to be able to take a period of statutory pay in a form other than a simple two-week block&#151;in other words either a one-week block or two discontinuous periods of one week&#151;should only be available where it is agreed with the employer.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para4"></a>In the first place, it is by no means certain that final regulations will allow for discontinuous pay periods of this sort. The initial draft of the Bill did not allow for it. But the Bill was amended as a result of long discussion in the other place, where many Members felt that it would be wrong to tie our hands irrevocably on the issue by enshrining the "single block" approach in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para5"></a>However, the Government are yet to be convinced that the case has been made to allow for discontinuous pay periods in practice. There are strong arguments, which were powerfully made to us in earlier consultation, for providing that leave and pay should remain available only in a single block. Of course, we will be consulting on the draft regulations, so people will have the chance to make the case to us. And the advantage of the Bill, as it now is, is that we do not rule out being able to make this change relatively simply, in secondary legislation, if experience of the new right once implemented suggests that it would be either helpful or at least painless for all concerned at some point in the future. But as things stand, I would not expect the Government to regulate in this way.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para6"></a>Even if we were to regulate to allow for the possibility of two discontinuous weeks, it would be very difficult also to provide that such periods are only available if agreed with the employer. What would happen if the employer delayed considering the matter, or unreasonably refused his agreement? I am not saying this would be common but we would need to consider the issue. We would need to provide for it in regulations&#151;perhaps with a formal appeal mechanism and so on. We would risk building into what is meant to be a simple and easily-administered right a new layer of complexity and regulation, and I do not believe that it is needed.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para7"></a>Over and over again, employers have told us that they do not want some sort of veto over their employees' ability to take paternity leave and pay; what they want is the greatest possible certainty&#151;advance notice and simple administration. This is what I believe we have provided for, and I fear that the <P>


<a name="column_CWH17"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment, while in many ways understandable, would risk departing from that approach. I, therefore, ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble friend disposes of this obviously undesirable amendment to give employers a veto, I understood him to say that consultation on the matter at the place of work would be very sensible and that the Government intend to promote that in one way or another, which presumably will also be reflected in the regulations. Was he placing emphasis particularly on the fact that the relevant paragraph begins, "if regulations permit", because, if he was, this is one of the very large number of occasions when it would be very difficult to read this Bill before all the regulations are printed and know just what it means? Do the Government envisage that regulations might not permit this paragraph to operate? There are cases later where the scope of regulation powers to alter what appears to be the meaning of the Bill is vast.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para8"></a>The Minister should consider, before Report stage, whether all these powers are necessary. It might be worth knowing what the Government have in mind with regard to the phrase "if regulations permit". Do they have in mind the possibility that they may not permit this to operate? I shall ask my noble friend the same sort of question at later stages but my noble friends and I believe it to be worth raising a general point in the particular matter to see what the Government's position is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I was merely making the point that it is clearly sensible for people to consult in this. That is not to say that the suggestion has to be a regulation, merely that it would be desirable and that people would be encouraged to consult in these circumstances. As regards how this would take place, I made our position clear: we are minded at the moment to have one period of two weeks and not to split it. We were, however, pushed as to whether we would put the flexibility in the primary legislation, which seemed a sensible move, and we have done it. Equally, I have made clear our current thinking on how that would operate. As regards powers in the regulations, the Delegated Powers Committee has looked at this and given us a clear bill of health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Obviously, my amendment has not received universal support and I will have to think carefully about how I pursue it at later stages. The noble Lord stressed the importance of advance notice and one of the great strengths of maternity leave is that you know fairly clearly when the event is going to happen.
<P>

<a name="20313-13_para9"></a>That brings me on to the point that paternity is not always quite so simple and there are occasions when people do not discover about their new paternal rights until long after the event. I therefore suggest that possibly further amendment should be put down as to what would happen to someone who discovered he was the father some years after. Therefore, 56 days would have denied him his entitlement&#151;but I am being flippant!

<a name="20313-13_para10"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord in that he has given fairly good assurance that the Government do not intend the regulations to do anything other than provide a two-week period. However, he felt that it was right that there should be a degree of flexibility to allow two separate periods of one week to be brought in later if after consultation that was felt to be desirable. I suspect I will not be coming back to this but I shall look carefully at what he said and if I do so, I shall follow the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and look carefully at where it ought to be introduced in the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 11, leave out "normal" and insert "average"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-14_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20313-14_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 33 is a very short amendment which requires an equally short and, I trust, simple explanation. While speaking to it, I would like also to speak to the identical amendments, Amendments Nos. 34 and 37, at line 18 on page 11, and also to Amendment No. 260, on page 55 line 41. I would also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 38 and 39.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para12"></a>The Bill talks about a person's "normal weekly earnings" and the first batch of my amendments seeks to alter the meaningless word of "normal" to "average". What are "normal" earnings? If a person is on a variable wage scale&#151;say, hourly or piece rate, or in a job where overtime is sometimes payable&#151;then who is to say what his "normal" wages are? Using the meaningless phrase "normal" will provide work for the court and for whole teams of lawyers. The clause, as drafted, attempts to define "normal", but how does it do so? It does it by reference to the "average" earnings, which is the intention in my amendment in any case.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para13"></a>I suspect that the draftsmen were simply trying to use the same word twice in the same sentence, but I am sure that we do not want to create a whole new legal concept of "normal" wages, simply because of some imaginary rule of syntax.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para14"></a>In Amendment No. 38, I propose to leave out the words:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-14_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am sorry&#151;I have got the headings wrong. I shall speak simply to the ones in the group.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para16"></a>A number of these amendments to the pay and adoption clauses replace the word "normal" with "average" in relation to the way in which earnings are calculated for working out how much statutory pay someone is entitled to.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para17"></a>I am tempted to ask "what's in a name?" because the effect of these amendments is to replace one undefined word with another. The language of the relevant clauses follows the language of the statutory maternity pay legislation in Section 171(4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The very important question is how "normal earnings", or whatever we call them, are defined. That is what this part of Clause 2 does: it provides for "normal earnings" to be defined in regulations.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para18"></a>This brings me to the noble Baroness's second set of amendments to these clauses&#151;those which have the effect of removing the ability to define "normal weekly earnings" in regulations. I note that the noble Baroness has not tabled an amendment to place a definition of "normal weekly earnings" on the face of the Bill. The cumulative effect of these amendments would be to leave both employers and employees with no clear understanding of what "normal" or "average" weekly earnings might be.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para19"></a>A definition of "normal weekly earnings" will inevitably be highly detailed and it will have to be included in the regulations. It cannot simply be reduced to the layman's word "average" without departing significantly from the maternity precedent. We believe that that detail is best set out in regulations, following the maternity precedent.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para20"></a>We must have a formula which is fair to the employee in properly reflecting what he receives from his employment and fair to the employer because it is straightforward to calculate. We intend here that "normal weekly earnings" for both paternity and adoption purposes should follow the model of the existing provisions for statutory maternity pay. The calculation of a person's normal weekly earnings for statutory maternity pay purposes is set out in Regulation 21 of the Statutory Maternity Pay (General) Regulations 1986. We intend to mirror that calculation for both statutory adoption pay and statutory paternity pay.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para21"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is happy with this approach. Some of her amendments would change simply names and not substance, and <P>


<a name="column_CWH21"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH21</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>others would prevent us placing the detail in regulations&#151;a significant departure from the statutory maternity pay precedent.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para22"></a>I now turn to the final amendment in the group which we are discussing in respect of Clause 22. We have considered "what's in a name", and I should say that there is no great significance in the use of the terms "average weekly earnings" for maternity allowance and "normal weekly earnings" for statutory maternity pay. As I shall explain, the calculations are different in a number of respects, reflecting the different nature of the payments in question. However, the key to both is that the calculations involve averaging amounts of pay in order to arrive at a fair amount on which to base entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para23"></a>Having said that, the draftsmen may well have felt that "average" was a more appropriate term to use in the context of maternity allowance because earnings from more than one job can be used to work out a woman's entitlement to maternity allowance, and the woman may well not have "normal" earnings as such in the same way as she might have "normal" weekly earnings from just one employer.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para24"></a>Let us take the example of a woman who has three jobs. Her earnings vary in each job depending on how many hours she puts in, but generally she earns &#163;20 a week in job one, &#163;40 a week in job two, and &#163;5 an hour for the few hours she occasionally puts in for job three. As her wages vary, what is "normal" for her? The important concept for maternity allowance is to be able to add all her earnings together and average them out to arrive at her weekly rate of maternity allowance.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para25"></a>Noble Lords may find it helpful if I explain how maternity allowance works. In 2000, we improved maternity allowance by extending entitlement to pregnant women on low earnings who did not earn enough to pay national insurance contributions. We did that by basing entitlement on the level of a woman's average weekly earnings from all sources rather than on the payment of national insurance contributions.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para26"></a>To obtain maternity allowance, a woman must satisfy two tests. First, she must have been employed or self-employed in at least 26 weeks out of the 66-week period ending with the week before the week when she expects her baby to be born. That is known as the test period. Secondly, she must earn on average at least &#163;30 a week. Under the current scheme, that average is then compared with the lower earnings limit for national insurance in force at the beginning of her test period. If the average is at least equal to that lower earnings limit, she will receive standard rate maternity allowance. If the average is less than that but at least &#163;30 a week, she will receive a weekly rate of maternity allowance worth 90 per cent of her average weekly earnings. From 2003, she will simply receive &#163;100 a week, or 90 per cent of her average weekly earnings if that is less.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para27"></a>Average weekly earnings for maternity allowance are worked out over a 13-week period. The woman may choose the 13-week period in which she received her best earnings; for example, she can take account of <P>


<a name="column_CWH22"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH22</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any period where she may have been paid a bonus or other payment which boosts her earnings in order to maximise the maternity allowance paid to her. I should say that this is in line with the statutory maternity payment calculation where account is taken of any payments made, including bonuses, when working out the average weekly earnings for statutory maternity pay. From 2003, we intend that a woman will have even more flexibility in the maternity allowance scheme to maximise her average weekly earnings, reach the qualifying maternity allowance threshold of &#163;30, and thus get the best rate of maternity allowance that she can. From 2003, she will be able to average out her earnings from the best 13 weeks in her test period.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para28"></a>Maternity allowance is intended to help pregnant women who work close to or during their pregnancy but who cannot qualify for statutory maternity pay because they are low paid, have more than one job, have broken work records or have recently left employment. By enabling those women to choose the best 13 weeks' earnings from different sources and average out their earnings, we are helping more women to obtain the financial help that they need in order to stop work for a period around the time of their babies' birth. Therefore, we believe that "average earnings" and not "normal earnings" is the correct expression. We believe that it more exactly describes a process by which relevant earnings are set for maternity allowance.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para29"></a>For completeness, I should explain that the rules for maternity allowance are rather different from those for SMP, which take the average of earnings over an eight-week period ending with a fixed point in the fifteenth week before the expected birth. The reason for the different approach is that for SMP we need to have a method of establishing earnings close to the start of maternity leave which achieves a balance between fairness to the employee and simplicity of operation for the employer. However, with regard to maternity allowance, we are dealing with women who may not be in employment at the end of their pregnancy, who may have a broken record of employment or for whom it is fairer to look at earnings over a longer period.
<P>

<a name="20313-14_para30"></a>I appreciate that the different use of the terms "normal earnings" and "average earnings" may seem puzzling. However, the way in which the terms are used in the Bill simply carries forward a difference in terminology in the existing legislation on maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay. What matters is what happens in practice. Now that I have explained the maternity allowance rules, I hope that your Lordships will understand why they work in the way that they do and agree that they are entirely reasonable. Therefore, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20313-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend. I have lost count of the number of times the Minister used the word "average".

Does the Minister also agree that <P>


<a name="column_CWH23"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>employers&#151;in particular, small employers&#151;will hold their heads in despair if they have to spend time unravelling and sorting out the meaning of what the noble Lord has just said?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble friend is to be congratulated on making very clear the need for the concept of normal weekly earnings to be used here. The difficulty that I have is not quite that of the noble Baroness who moved the amendment, which I hope will be resisted. "Normal weekly earnings" is a fundamental concept in various areas of employment protection law. A definition in Section 234 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 will not apply. A definition in Regulation 21 of the Statutory Maternity Pay Regulations, which, by chance, I have before me, is extremely complex but, when it is worked out, it is very clear.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para0"></a>As I understood my noble friend the Minister, the Government want to apply that notion with one or two minimal changes. I do not understand why we have to wait for a regulation in order to say so. If the Government know how they want to define "normal weekly earnings", why cannot they say so in the Bill? I have given notice on a number of occasions that I shall raise this kind of point with my noble friends. It seems to me that this is a perfect occasion on which to inquire why they need to ask officials to draft a regulation and leave everyone in suspense. The world is waiting to know what "normal weekly earnings" means in this section of the Bill. In some places that I know of, they speak of little else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble friend Lord McIntosh may not hear it spoken of in Hampstead, but it will seriously engage the attention of employers. However, I do not believe that noble Lords should concentrate only on employers. There will be a number of advisers in trade unions who will try to help women workers in relation to maternity pay and male workers in relation to paternity pay. I cannot for the life of me think why the Government cannot put on the face of the Bill a definition of national weekly earnings in the light of what my noble friend said. If the only reason is that they have not yet made up their minds, perhaps they had better say that, because I do not believe it. I believe that they know perfectly well what they mean by normal earnings here. I urge my noble friend to adopt a new and, with a little help, liberal approach to this matter and tell us what the Bill means as much as he possibly can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   When I used to sit on an industrial tribunal, it was a regular discussion as to whether the word "normal" included overtime and whether it only included overtime if you were obliged to do it as opposed to it being voluntary. The same complication comes in with the word "average". These are points that should be clarified.

<FONT SIZE=3>provision seems to me sensible given that you have to work out average earnings which inevitably involves pages of complicated calculations. The Bill refers to normal earnings which are defined in the regulations. You cannot sensibly put that amount of regulation on the face of the Bill, not least because if there are changes in tax or anything else, that may affect it. You must sensibly put that matter in regulations. Of course, the regulations will not be exactly the same as those for maternity pay. You cannot sensibly put all that information, which covers all kinds of situations, part-time workers and others, onto the face of the Bill.

<A NAME="20313-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am sorry to press my noble friend on this but I have in front of me regulation 21 of the 1986 regulations to which he referred. As I understand it, that is the pattern that the Government wish to adopt in this part of the Bill. I have not been able to add up the lines, and he will forgive me if I am wrong, but I estimate that there are 30 or 40 lines. Is he saying there is no room in the Bill for another 40 lines, or that he does not know which line will apply? Do we not know what the regulation will say? If we do know what the regulation will say, why cannot he put the 40 lines in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   We could do so but you lose the flexibility to change that if there are very good reasons for doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   On that point, have the 1986 regulations which the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, cited been changed since 1986, or are we still dealing with the same regulations? If they have not been changed in 16 years, it seems unlikely that there will be a frequent need to change them. Therefore, why cannot they be added to the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-15_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Some 10 minutes or so ago, I started by saying this is a very short amendment which required only a simple explanation. I added the words "I trust", and I see that my trust is somewhat misplaced, because it turned out to be an extraordinarily complicated matter when I listened to the Minister. I agree with my noble friend Lady Blatch. I lost count of how many times he described average earnings in describing the term "normal". At the beginning of the Minister's answer to me, "normal" was not defined and "average" was not defined and I have tried to point out that they are defined in some way by the term "average earnings". I believe that that really is a complication.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para1"></a>I take note of what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, says. I shall read very carefully what the noble Lord said and see whether the matter becomes more simple and more understandable as I read it. However, while I wish we were in Office and I were standing at the Dispatch Box and the Minister were in my place, I am very glad I did not have to read out his reply because I thought it was totally convoluted and very unclear. It may be that that is one of the reasons why the matter is not properly defined at this stage. But there is no reason why, when the Government <P>

"( ) Regulations under section 75A or 75B shall provide that a person suffer no detriment by virtue of taking adoption leave, but shall not be protected from any detriment that he would have suffered had he not been taking adoption leave."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20313-15_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is an identical amendment to that proposed by my honourable friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in Standing Committee in the other place. However, it was withdrawn by him after the response of the Minister for Employment Relations and the Regions. I have read that short debate but felt it necessary to bring the amendment back today for some further consideration. For the sake of completeness and clarity I have reproduced the entire amendment, even though the Minister gave a technically satisfactory but entirely legalistic explanation of the first half of that amendment.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para8"></a>As this Bill is going to be relied upon by ordinary people, employers and employees alike, their rights and obligations should be entirely clear to them if they try to look up things themselves without having to employ a lawyer or consult an expert. These are important matters and the answers should be easily found and simple to understand. It ought to be possible for an employer and employee to sort out a potential problem or answer a simple question without having to go from one Act to another and so on. It is difficult enough when we are dealing with legislation ourselves. We are becoming more experienced at going from one Act to another but in the world of employment relations&#151;the whole purpose of this Bill appears to be to make those relationships easier&#151;simplicity and clarity are important.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para9"></a>The amendment is in two halves. The first provides that a person who takes adoption leave should suffer no detriment. It is to that half that the Minister gave the technically correct answer, which I would like to quote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Detriment is dealt with in Schedule 6, subsection 24, which will amend Section 47(c)(2) of the Employment Rights Act 1996."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-15_para10"></a>
So for an employee to check that he is not to suffer a detriment for taking adoption leave, he has to find paragraph 24 of the sixth schedule to this Bill, which inserts an extra five words of amendment to another measure, which he would also have to read to find out what the draftsman is talking about. In the interests of the persons who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of this legislation on the one hand and those who are supposed to comply with it on the other, what possible harm is there in repeating in plain language, complete on the face of it and complete in itself, that a person <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taking adoption leave is to suffer no detriment for doing so? Never mind that the same thing is said elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para11"></a>However, the second part of the amendment expressly stipulates that a person shall not be protected from a detriment that he would have suffered, whether he had adopted a child or not. I regret that on that part of the amendment, the Minister's reply in the other place was not satisfactory. It was factually correct but that does not make it satisfactory. The Minister said there,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Issues on which they cannot suffer detriment are in the Bill. Matters such as whether an employee should be treated in the same way as every other employee do not have to be in the Bill."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-15_para12"></a>
I disagree. For the reasons I have already given, there is no reason why the facts should not be clearly spelled out that an adoptive father may not be protected from a deserved or inevitable detriment merely because he is involved in the adoption.
<P>

<a name="20313-15_para13"></a>In 1925, Parliament passed the workmen's compensation Act, which was deliberately drafted in non-legal language so every workman would clearly be able to understand his rights. The workmen may well have understood the Act but the truth is that the lawyers did not. In consequence, it became one of the most litigated pieces of legislation that Parliament has ever passed. That does not, however, make the sentiment wrong. The sentiment is right: there is no reason why anyone should have to trawl through this Bill, even assuming that he knows where to begin looking, only to find that his rights are defined by an extension to a section in another Act when the whole problem is resolved by the elegant 42 words drafted by my honourable friend in the other place. I am not even pretending that I drafted them! I have just lifted them and it looks very good and it would be very clear if it were in the Bill. They may be repetitive of what is said elsewhere, buried in the thick schedule which is difficult to find for someone who is not conversant with this kind of matter. Saying it twice, once very clearly, does no harm. It is only belt and braces. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I wanted to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;and no doubt she can reply to this in due course when she responds to the debate&#151;whether what she called this clear and elegant amendment really means what it says. It says that there is to be no detriment by virtue of taking adoption leave&#151;most previous precedents against victimisation. Of course the word "detriment" is a polite word in employment protection legislation for "victimisation" of a worker who takes his rights or indeed proposes to take his rights. I do not notice any element of proposing.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para0"></a>Even more importantly, the amendment goes on to say that a worker is not to be protected from any detriment that he would have suffered if he did not take adoption leave. Does the amendment mean any lawful detriment or does it mean any detriment? There is, of course, a raft of legislation protecting workers from employers who victimise them for taking or proposing to take their employment protection rights. <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3> However, not in this Bill; it is defective on victimisation, even in the schedules. It is a bad employer who does it, but anyone who thinks it does not happen should look at the law reports every month and he will find these sections being the subject of enforcement, since employees are not yet barred from access to the tribunals. If the amendment means any detriment, including those covered by sections of other statutes, its elegance mystifies me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I suggest that, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said, I can leave my response until after I hear what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I deal first with those two points. The first is whether one should in these cases refer back to something in a previous Act. We would not, of course, expect employers to have to refer to Acts themselves. What they do in reality is to refer to guidance and we will provide that. The approach of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would mean endless copying out of previous legislation into the new legislation, making it lengthier and wordier and doubtless attracting criticism accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para1"></a>On the substance of her amendment, as the Minister in the other place explained to the honourable Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the question of detriment is dealt with in paragraph 24 of Schedule 7 to the Bill. This provision will amend the Employments Rights Act 1996, Part V, Section 47C(2) so that employees who exercise their right to ordinary or additional adoption leave do not suffer detriment as a result of taking or seeking to take that leave. The detriment treatment in question must relate to adoption leave. This includes the intention to take it. For example, it would protect an employee from detrimental treatment if he were selected for redundancy on grounds of his being on adoption leave or the intention to take adoption leave.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para2"></a>On the other hand we should be absolutely clear that it will not protect an employee from suffering the consequences of any of his actions that are not related to his taking or intending to take adoption leave. It does not provide the employee with some generalised protection from being disciplined simply because he happens to be on adoption leave at that time. I therefore invite the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say and I hoped that he would comment on the point about lawful detriment in the second part of my amendment, which would have made it somewhat easier for me.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para3"></a>I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that I would not pretend to debate with him anything of this ilk in employment law, because I know that he is an authority. In view of what he has said about a number of other things that could be causing the problem when they were not lawful, which I did not know about, I would certainly beg leave to withdraw this amendment. I shall look very carefully at that particular part to see whether I consider it <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 40:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 22, line 28, leave out "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-16_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20313-16_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: I speak to Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 together. Although these two amendments are for two consecutive clauses, Clauses 7 and 8, on two different subjects, they both deal with the contents of yet more regulations to be made by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para13"></a>Clause 7(1) requires the Secretary of State to make regulations concerning the funding of employers' liability to statutory paternity and adoption pay. The subsection begins:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-16_para14"></a>
Since the clause requires the Secretary of State to make regulations, it is logical that the clause should specify the content of those regulations. It is not as though the content of subsection (4) is some long, esoteric shopping list. The use of the word "may" here, as distinct from "shall", is also, in a way, objectionable, because subsection (4) relates to funding which should be mandatory and not at the discretion of the board or, even more importantly, the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para15"></a>The straightforward contents of subsection (4) are matters which logic, good government and sensible drafting make mandatory. I would not want to accept an answer that my amendment is too prescriptive, if that is what the Minister might be minded to say in response&#151;as he sometimes does. If the Minister will not accept this amendment, I would like him to tell me what is wrong with his own menu in subsection (4), and to tell me which of the three simple and logical provisions&#151;(a) or (b) or (c)&#151; the Government might not include in any regulation. If they were not going to include them, why not?
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para16"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 41. Clause 8(1) is permissive about whether the Secretary of State makes the regulations or not. The subsection begins:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may make regulations",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-16_para17"></a>
and that is why the amendment begins:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the Secretary of State makes regulations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-16_para18"></a>
However, the amendment goes on, as in the case of Clause 7, to prescribe that they shall contain the provision set out in subsection (2). Once again, there is nothing exceptional in the list in subsection (2) and I can see no reason why the Secretary of State would not <P>


<a name="column_CWH29"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wish to include the complete set of these items which the Government have selected in the regulations, if she decides to make any. Indeed, in our opinion, the Secretary of State should be obliged to make regulations on the very points that they have put into that subsection, which is why I have brought this particular amendment forward.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para19"></a>I would appreciate an explanation of which of the specified amendments the Minister thinks there is even a remote possibility of not including, and his reasons for that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We have had many happy hours on "may" and "shall" in legislation over the years. Parliamentary counsel will not thank me if I depart from the standard line&#151;which I never believed when I was in Opposition and I do not expect the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to believe now.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para20"></a>The principle of "may" and "shall", so far as this case is concerned, is that this is a clause about administrative arrangements. It is right that the power to make regulation should be broadly permissive, and that has been observed in legislation for many years. The administrative arrangements may need to change as the scheme develops, either because they become too complex or because they do not do the job for which they were intended. We do not think we intend to make changes but we may have to do so.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para21"></a>I turn to the particular case now. Clause 7 is all about the way in which statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay will be recovered by employers. We have made it clear from the start that employers will be able to recover a proportion or all of the statutory payments they make, following the precedent of statutory maternity pay. Indeed, I think we would come under legitimate criticism if we departed from statutory maternity pay. The provision for recovery is on the face of the Bill and the detail will be in regulations.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para22"></a>Subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 7 set in place the same system for recovering statutory paternity and adoption pay at the same rate as applies for statutory maternity pay. All employers will be entitled to recover at least 92 per cent and it also provides for small employers' relief.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para23"></a>We see no circumstances in which we would withdraw the employer's right to recover, and indeed in Clause 7(1) in line 2 of the page we say that the Secretary of State shall make those regulations and that those regulations shall deal with the amount that an employer may recover. The amount in percentage terms is fixed on the face of the Bill, as it is for statutory maternity pay.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para24"></a>The amendment asks us to commit ourselves to regulations under subsection (4). There is no difference here. The subsection sets out the things that will be in regulations but it does not set out everything. As the noble Baroness rightly quoted, it sets out for funding in advance, for funding to come from monies that the employer is due to pay over to the Inland Revenue and for the Inland Revenue to recover any amount overpaid.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH30"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para25"></a>If the noble Baroness is looking for a commitment that we will do those things, we gave that commitment in the other place and I give it now. The regulations under subsection (4) of Clause 7 will do a couple of very important things.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para26"></a>They will enable employers to recover what they pay out in statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay from amounts that they owe to the Inland Revenue. The most important thing that the clause does is to provide for a new right for employers to be able to ask for a payment in advance from the Inland Revenue to cover statutory paternity or adoption pay payments where the money the employer is due to pay is greater than the total amount due to the Inland Revenue in the same period.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para27"></a>That is better than statutory maternity pay and we introduce a similar right to claim advance payments in Clause 21 of the Bill. Making this change will bring the statutory payment schemes in line with what already exists for tax credits and is an important step in easing the burden of these schemes for employers, especially for small employers who will most often be in the position of requesting funding.
<P>

<a name="20313-16_para28"></a>I turn now to Clause 8 and the amendment to page 23 line 6. Again, the noble Baroness is asking what the regulations cover here. I think that is clearly set out in the Bill and I do not think there is any need to go into any further detail. The difficult part is the word "shall", and it is drafting procedure that we are dealing with, administrative arrangements that should be made. As I said at the beginning, it is governed by the "shall" which is in subsection (1) of Clause 7.

<a name="20313-17_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I would like to speak to Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 together as they are identical. The first alters the description of a person in the regulations from,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-17_para9"></a>

<a name="20313-17_para10"></a>
any person entitled to statutory paternity or adoption pay"; in other words, it changes the entitlement from "a person who has been a spouse or partner" to "a person who was the spouse or partner when the entitlement was claimed".
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para11"></a>The reason for that change is obvious&#151;it is intended to clear up a manifest anomaly. As the Bill is drafted, a spouse or partner could have left the domestic home and yet could still have claimed the benefit of statutory paternity or adoption pay. The object of those benefits, as stated in the notes and as enshrined elsewhere in the Bill, is to enable a spouse or partner to take time off work in order to lend support to his spouse or partner. They are not intended to finance him if he has deserted his spouse or partner and has abandoned those obligations together with his obligations to the new child, having perhaps run off and set up home with a new partner.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para12"></a>Amendment No. 43 has a similar purpose. Clause 10(2)(c) refers to a person who is, or has been, an employer of a claimant. There is no reason why a former employer should have a continuing obligation to fund so-called paternity leave when the father or adopter is no longer in his employment. What is he on leave from? It could be argued that the provision seeks to cover the case of a person whose employment has terminated without thought on the part of the employee some time before the birth or adoption.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para13"></a>How far back does the right to claim go? Does it go back to the date of conception of the child or the date when the adoption process began? The Bill does not say how "former" the former employee must be; nor does it cover the situation where an employee is dismissed for a good cause. Neither of those omissions are suitable for inclusion in a regulation which the Secretary of State may or may not make. They should be dealt with in the Bill itself.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para14"></a>I had previously tabled an amendment to Clause 2 in which I proposed that an employee should not be entitled to statutory paternity pay from an employer if he no longer worked for that employer. However, in a letter to me dated 6th March, which was kindly copied to the Front Bench of the Liberal Democrats and to the Convenor of the Cross Bench Peers, the Minister of State said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would generally be the case that an employee will not be entitled to statutory paternity pay from his employer if he no longer works for that employer."

The Government tabled a group of amendments to Clause 2 which rectified that position. The Minister spoke to it at length earlier. I am grateful to the Minister for having addressed those problems.

<a name="20313-17_para16"></a>However, as your Lordships will see, precisely the same problem arises in relation to Clause 10(2)(c). I am confident that, in the interests of consistency, the Government will accept this amendment and that, in the interests of further consistency, they will agree to apply the principle to spouses or partners who, for whatever reason, have departed from the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I am glad that the noble Baroness has explained the position. At first I could not believe it, but it seems that it is so. Paternity leave, paternity pay and paternity benefit are being turned into a form of moral policing. If a man leaves his wife or if his wife leaves him, they do not receive the money. One only looks after a person if one lives in a home with that person. Millions of parents do not live with their ex-spouses, but they still support them and are entitled to statutory leave and statutory pay, which plays an important part. Why must we have such morality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Morality has nothing to do with my amendment. If the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, believes that it has, then obviously I did not explain it as clearly as I thought. One reason for paternity pay, which, unlike maternity pay, is a new idea which we thoroughly accept, is that a new father should have time off in order to help his spouse. The point I am making is that, if he has now separated from his spouse and is not living with her, he will not be there to help his spouse&#151;at least, I do not imagine that he will be. I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, believes that a person should be given the pay under those circumstances. The payment is not made simply because a man has fathered a child; it is made because he has a role and has time off in order to help with the child. That is my very simple view. If the noble Lord believed that the amendment concerned a matter of morality, then I am afraid that I did not explain it clearly. It does not concern morality.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The noble Baroness tries to explain the position but she makes it worse. Simply because a person leaves the nest does not mean that he does not help. Millions of ex-spouses&#151;some who never married&#151;are absent and perhaps far away, but they do help. Unless one is going to be a moral policeman, one cannot try to distinguish between one group and another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Perhaps these matters will be dealt with ultimately by the section which I asked about during debate on the first series of amendments but in response to which I did not receive a proper explanation. The regulations referred to in new Section 80A(5),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"specify things which are, or are not, to be taken as done for the purpose of caring for a child or supporting the child's mother".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-17_para17"></a>
However, like my noble friend, I am not sure what support of the child's mother the father can offer if he has left the child's mother. As my noble friend said, this has nothing to do with morality. But what is the point of giving someone paternity leave if they will no longer be one of the caring parents?

<A NAME="20313-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I say to all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate that they are talking about entitlement. Whether they believe that the father should be entitled if he does not live with the mother, or whether they believe that it should be the other way round, they are still talking about entitlement to paternity pay. This clause is not about entitlement; it concerns powers to require information. Therefore, if I may respectfully say so, both sides of the argument are misconceived.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para18"></a>Clause 10 is very important in that it provides the necessary backstop for dealing with that small minority of individuals or employers who do not wish to co-operate. In the experience of the Inland Revenue, most employers, and most individuals, comply voluntarily with their obligations. However, sometimes that does not happen; sometimes things go wrong and need to be looked at more closely. When that happens, the Inland Revenue will need to ask people for information in order to sort things out. This clause enables the Inland Revenue to do just that.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para19"></a>The amendments concern the use of the phrase "has been" when referring to a former partner or employer respectively. I understand that none of us wants to give Inland Revenue officers the power to dig around and ask questions of people who are not relevant to the matter in hand, whether they are partners or employers. I quite agree with that concern. It would be a great infringement of privacy to go back to, say, an ex-wife and ask questions about her former husband's new relationship. That is not the intention of the power and there is a safeguard on the face of the Bill to prevent that. I shall explain how that happens.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para20"></a>The overriding principle set down in subsection (1) of Clause 10 brings in the word "reasonable". The information must be "reasonably required" in order to check whether there is entitlement to statutory paternity or adoption pay. This provides an important safeguard in that an Inland Revenue officer must have very good grounds for supposing that the person from whom he wishes to obtain information has information relevant to the matter in hand&#151;indeed, that it is critical to the matter in hand.
<P>

<a name="20313-17_para21"></a>However, if the Bill were drafted in the way set out in the amendments, an additional and unnecessary step would be imported into the process. The officer would have to prove the former partner's or employer's status at a specific time. That would simply be unworkable and, indeed, it could form part of the dispute. An employer could argue that an employee left his employment on a date before the entitlement to statutory paternity pay started, or the employee could say that he was still employed. In order to sort that out, the Inland Revenue officer would need to look at payroll and personnel information. However, the employer could refuse to co-operate by maintaining that he was not the employer at the time of the entitlement. Members of the Committee can see the circularity that one might get into if these amendments were included in the Bill.

<A NAME="20313-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   If my noble friend's amendment and the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, are completely irrelevant, I hope that the Minister will answer a very brief question. This matter might be relevant in relation to further amendments that might need to be tabled at Report&#151;doubtless, however, the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, will oppose them. Would it be possible to get paternity leave although one was no longer one of the caring parents; that is, if one had left the mother of the child before the birth of the child, and one was therefore not going to be looking after the child? Is it possible to get paternity leave in those circumstances?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am reluctant to reply because we are debating Clause 10, which is about powers to require information. However, to help the noble Lord, Lord Henley, in deciding what to do at Report, the answer is yes&#151;under certain circumstances, paternity pay could be given to somebody who was not living with another. That is what the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said, and he was right.

Without any advance warning, a Statement will be made in the Chamber which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, has to deliver. I have to respond to it on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. That is of course one of the disadvantages of taking the Bill in Grand Committee. I am due to move Amendments Nos. 54 and 55.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Henley, indicated, that is exactly what would happen were this Committee sitting in the Chamber.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   The Deputy Chairman of Committees said at the beginning of proceedings that the proceedings in the Committee would be identical to proceedings on the Floor of the House, with the one exception that we would not be voting on anything.

<a name="20313-18_para8"></a>Clause 12 provides for penalties for fraud or negligence.

<a name="20313-18_para9"></a>Similarly, under Clause 12(3), the penalty for an incorrect payment of paternity pay is &#163;300 whereas, under Clause 12(4), the penalty for incorrect payment of adoption pay is &#163;3,000&#151;again, that is 10 times as much.

<a name="20313-18_para10"></a>I might have assumed that the discrepancy between the two types of case was a mere typographical error&#151;perhaps something went wrong and a typist held down the zero key for a little longer than she should have done. However, in Clause 12(5) there is a clear statement on this matter. That subsection makes it clear that for some reason the Government want the power for whoever adjudicates to exact a penalty in cases relating to adoption pay that is 10 times that for cases relating to paternity pay. That subsection is dealt with in Amendment No. 47. Why is one employee more deserving of seeing his employer have to pay a greater penalty than another? Why is one employer who commits what, after all, is an identical offence, to be liable to receive a more draconian penalty than another? I cannot think of a single reason&#151;even a fanciful or implausible one&#151;for such discrimination between natural fathers and adoptive fathers who have been badly treated by their employers. I await, with very rapt interest, to hear what the Minister has to say on this subject. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-18_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Baroness's amendments to Clause 12&#151;they relate to lines 33, 37 and 44 on page 25&#151;turn on the amount of the penalty being imposed for fraud or negligence in respect of statutory adoption pay.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para11"></a>Before I deal with those issues, I turn to the noble Baroness's amendment to page 25, line 43, which also concerns fraud and negligence. Perhaps I should say at the start that, by emphasising that penalties will not be applied lightly, there will be no penalty where someone has taken reasonable care but has simply made a mistake&#151;whether they are an employee or an employer. That is clearly stated in the opening lines of subsections (1) to (5) of the clause&#151;fraud or negligence must be involved.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para12"></a>I understand from the noble Baroness's amendment to page 25, line 43, that she is understandably keen to ensure that someone who made an error and then notified the board of that error so that it could be rectified would not be in danger of being penalised for that. That situation would of course be looked at in any investigation and, if it was clear that no fraud or negligence was involved, there would be no penalty.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para13"></a>I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness on that point, in particular because the amendment to page 25 line 43 would impose an extra step in the process, which was quite unnecessary. It would appear to enable someone who has already fraudulently or negligently obtained wrong payments to escape sanctions, simply by notifying the board that he had done so within the required time. It would also make it imperative that a fraudulent or negligent failure to notify had also occurred, which would, in effect, mean having to prove that two actions had taken place for one offence. The single important point is whether incorrect payment had been obtained fraudulently or negligently.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para14"></a>I move on to the other amendments tabled by the noble Baroness to Clause 12, at lines 33, 37 and 44 on page 25. However, before I continue I would like to stress that in all cases we are talking here about the <P>


<a name="column_CWH37"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>maximum penalty that may be imposed, not the actual amount in every case. In practice, penalties apply in the same way whether the error results from fraud or negligence, although the amount of the penalty imposed will, of course, reflect the seriousness of the offence. In addition, the maximum level of penalties is the same for employers and for employees.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para15"></a>A key determinant of the seriousness of an offence is the amount of money falsely claimed and obtained. The amount that could be lost to the Exchequer in a fraudulent statutory adoption pay claim could be very significant. The amount paid over a 26-week period could be &#163;2,600 and the small employers' relief would raise it further. A penalty of only &#163;300 for fraud of this magnitude would be quite inappropriate and, I would argue, no deterrent at all. It would clearly be unfair if someone who fraudulently obtained over &#163;2,000 incurred the same penalty as someone who obtained &#163;200.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para16"></a>Clearly, for statutory paternity pay, where the maximum possible obtained for one person would be &#163;200 plus the small employers' relief, which is currently five per cent, there is no need to set a maximum above &#163;300 as for each offence the amount lost would be within that figure.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para17"></a>These examples are at the top end of the scale&#151;the situation where the highest sum of money in each case has been falsely obtained. I suspect the noble Baroness is more concerned about what would happen at the other end of the scale, where an employer or employee fiddled statutory adoption pay for a week or so over and above the entitlement. As I explained, the &#163;3,000 figure is a maximum. The Inland Revenue officer would look at various factors in deciding the level of the penalty. This would include looking at how much was obtained falsely and whether fraud or negligence was involved. In general, the Inland Revenue officer would normally impose a heavier penalty for fraud than negligence.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para18"></a>In addition, there will be&#151;as always with such penalties&#151;the right of appeal against both the imposition of the penalty itself and the amount incurred. If the employer or employee felt they had been treated too harshly they would be able to ask the independent Tax Appeal Commissioners to look at the position.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para19"></a>To sum up, I feel that we have got it right in terms of the amounts of penalties that could be imposed. We need to have a maximum figure which is appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, and I have explained why &#163;3,000 is an appropriate figure to penalise fraud or negligence in respect of statutory adoption pay. We also need to build in safeguards to ensure that the amounts actually imposed are proportionate. These safeguards are in the guidance that the Inland Revenue officers will follow and in the right of appeal to the appeal commissioners where the person penalised thinks they have got it wrong.

<FONT SIZE=3>spoke about paternity pay and I was talking about paternity and adoption. It may have been a slip of the tongue. I do understand that people can use discretion, and I do understand that when the words "not exceeding" are used that is absolutely the maximum, whether it is &#163;300 or &#163;3,000. I understand that very well.
<P>

<a name="20313-18_para20"></a>Having listened to the Minister, I have to confess that I still do not understand why, for an adoptive parent, the maximum&#151;whether it is discretionary or not&#151;is &#163;3,000, and for a natural father it is &#163;300. That is the point I am making, not that I think there is anything peculiar about the way the matter is handled. It is just the difference between the two that I find completely inexplicable. I understand exactly what the Minister is saying about maximum figures and the use of discretion. That is stated quite clearly in the statute itself. However, from his answer I did not understand why there is such a difference&#151;that is, why one figure is ten times more than the other as between adoptive and natural parents.

<A NAME="20313-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The point that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has missed is that in one instance an individual employer is capable of defrauding more; that is why the penalty is greater. That is the point&#151;it has to be a disincentive. That is why the penalties are fixed at the relevant level for each offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I do not understand the position of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, on this matter. In each case there is fraud. One involves a paternity case and the other involves an adoption case. Is my noble friend advancing the argument that as a general principle of criminal law the extent of the fraud must govern the maximum penalty that is available to a court? Is that the principle? If so, I suppose that there is a distinction, but to make it 10 times larger in the case of a fraud on each side of the table seems rather large.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   That involves a civil penalty. That point needs to be understood. It is to do with the amount that can be defrauded. That is why we need an active disincentive to be built into the legislation.

<A NAME="20313-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The real argument is not about the &#163;3,000 but about the &#163;300. I see the point that is being made&#151;there is a difference between &#163;300 and &#163;3,000, but I do not see how &#163;300 will deter anybody.

<a name="20313-19_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Paragraph 1(5) of the schedule provides for the board or its authorised officer to increase the penalty when it is considered that it has "become insufficient". The power to increase a penalty after a case is over and judgment has been given is not one that is open to the civil and criminal courts. The phrase is that the judge had become functious officio, which sounds pretty awful but means only that the judge's part in the process has become defunct. It is only in exceptional cases that in a criminal case the prosecution can ask for a sentence afterwards to be increased. The judicial parts of the Bill do not readily render themselves open to appeal or review. I suppose that that is the reason why the Government have decided to give the tribunal the chance to have a second bite of the cherry.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para6"></a>However, the scales of justice are supposed to be held on an equipoise, as Members of the Committee would see if they looked at the statue of Justice in the Prince's Chamber, if only someone had not removed them altogether because the weights were always being stolen!
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para7"></a>I suppose that it is theoretically possible that a tribunal might come to the conclusion that it had been a bit too hard on an employer and that it should reduce the penalty. I say that more in hope than in expectation. If the tribunal wants for whatever reason to reduce the penalty, it should have the power to do so in exactly the same way as the Bill gives it power to increase the penalty. That therefore is the aim of Amendment No. 48 and of consequential Amendment No. 49.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para8"></a>I have to confess that on re-reading Amendment No. 48, which was drafted for me by one of my advisers, I would have preferred to have used the phrase, "has been found to be excessive" because that would have been better phraseology. However, assuming that the Minister agrees to this very modest amendment as stands on the Marshalled List, we could deal with its wording at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para9"></a>Amendment No. 50 calls for the total deletion of subsection 5(5). Section 5, as the marginal note tells us, deals with penalty proceedings before a court. Subsection (1) makes it clear that it applies to cases:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where in the opinion of the Board the liability of any person for a penalty . . . arises by reason of the fraud of that or of any other person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-19_para10"></a>
We are talking about cases of fraud. However, subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If . . . the court does not find that fraud is proved but considers that the person concerned is . . . liable to a penalty, the court may determine a penalty notwithstanding that, but for the opinion of the Board as to fraud, the penalty would not have been a matter for the court".

<a name="column_CWH40"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
What sort of justice is that? The board launches what, to all intents and purposes, is a prosecution alleging fraud. The court, in its wisdom, decides that there was no fraud. In other words, the person is not guilty. Nevertheless, the court is still to have the power to impose a penalty, because the board&#151;mistakenly, as it happens&#151;thought that one should have been imposed.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para12"></a>It is reported that a Scottish judge once told a defendant&#151;I regret that I am unable to speak with the sort of accent that would make this story so much better&#151;"Maybe you did it and maybe you didn't, but we think you would be none the worse for a hanging, so we will have you hanged!" This clause strikes me as being well up to the standard of the kangaroo court in Alice in Wonderland&#151;sentence first, verdict afterwards.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para13"></a>I seriously doubt whether a law that enabled the court, which had just acquitted a defendant of the charge against him, to inflict a penalty on him none the less because the prosecution thought he must have done something to deserve it would stand up for as long as one minute before the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para14"></a>I am absolutely convinced that this provision is at variance with the certificate of the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, that the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall try to plead mitigation having heard the noble Baroness's case. The amendments are to Schedule 1 of the Bill, which sets out the mechanics dealing with the penalties described in Clauses 11 and 12. The schedule applies to procedures that are in common with the procedures that are already used by the Inland Revenue when dealing with penalties for tax, national insurance contributions and tax credits. There is nothing new in the schedule&#151;that is the way in which that happens now in relation to most other areas of the Inland Revenue's business and services.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para15"></a>As the noble Baroness noted, paragraph 1(5) of the schedule allows an Inland Revenue officer to increase a penalty. It states that the officer can look again at a penalty that he has determined if he discovers new information that leads him to believe that the offence leading to the penalty was more serious than was originally supposed and that the penalty should therefore be increased. For example, the amount of statutory adoption pay that is fraudulently obtained may be found to be greater than was previously calculated.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para16"></a>However, the noble Baroness quite reasonably concludes that that should work both ways. If something comes to light that shows that the original offence was less serious, the penalty should decrease. For example, the amount of statutory adoption pay that is fraudulently obtained may be found to be less than was previously calculated.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para17"></a>I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness that the arrangement works both ways&#151;that is already provided for in the Bill. I direct her to paragraph 6 of <P>


<a name="column_CWH41"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the schedule on page 63 at line 22. That paragraph contains a general power for the board to mitigate any penalty. The board can decrease the penalty if it feels that the circumstances warrant a lower amount. There is no such general power for it to increase the amount of a penalty. That is why the specific provisions in paragraph 1(5) are included.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para18"></a>It is also important to note that the general power to mitigate does not rely on the discovery of new information&#151;the amendments of the noble Baroness would do so. The provision for increasing the penalty is much more tightly drawn than the provision to reduce it. Not only does any increase rely on new information but the increased amount will also carry a further right of appeal, because it is a new determination by the officer. That is quite a significant fact to take into account. In any case, the original penalty notice will have carried a right of appeal, too.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para19"></a>Turning to the noble Baroness's amendment at page 63, lines 17 to 21, as I started to say inadvertently earlier, this is a standard piece of drafting in tax penalty legislation, although I admit it is not the easiest for the lay person to understand. It might help if I explain what the subsection does. It permits the High Court to determine a penalty for negligence if it finds that fraud is not proved but considers that the defendant is still liable to a penalty for negligence. This prevents the need for penalty proceedings to be started again&#151;so, if you like, it cuts through bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para20"></a>I said earlier that provisions in the schedule were based on tried and tested procedures common to other areas of the Inland Revenue's business and services&#151;tax, national insurance contributions and tax credits. There are good reasons for making sure that we replicate them as far as possible for these new statutory payments. They have been thoroughly examined and tested by a whole phalanx of tax experts who monitor what the Inland Revenue service does and they are familiar to the employers, who deal daily with the Revenue in a wide variety of contexts. I understand that this is not a simple matter and I have tried to explain to the noble Baroness's satisfaction why the amendments are unnecessary, since the safeguard she seeks is already provided for in the legislation. In those terms, I would invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am comforted by what the Minister has said in directing us to paragraph 6 of the schedule, which points out that they can decrease as well as increase. I am content with that.
<P>

<a name="20313-19_para21"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 50, the Minister said it is quite complicated and that not everybody understands it, and I have to say that I still do not. I read very carefully what the Minister said. I did not realise that in respect of the negligence in this case, where no fraud at all has been found because the idea of the penalty is against fraud, the court can say that there is no fraud, but that it will fine the person for being negligent. I did not realise there was the possibility that that could happen.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is important to understand that negligence is an act or omission in itself, so that there will be an element of deliberate activity by the person involved. That is why there is the separate offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I must still say to the Minister that I do not understand that. These clauses are dealing with fraud, and I thought fraud was when you had the mens rea to know that you were doing something absolutely wrong. In negligence, it may be that you did not know, but I am not sure that it is right that the High Court can then impose a fine. I would like the Minister to look at that again and I will certainly speak to my own legal advisers on that because I do not feel that this is the correct approach.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para0"></a>I am concerned about the matter. Somebody accused by the board of fraud may go through a whole High Court trial and be found not to have committed fraud, but be found to have been negligent. The Minister did not elaborate on what kind of negligence was involved. Was it related to the way he presented his case, or what he did or did not do? It may very well be that there will be facts that will prove that what the Minister is saying is the correct approach but, from where I stand, without a very deep knowledge of the law, I find it confusing. I would like some more information.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para1"></a>I am sorry that I interrupted the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I seek only to be helpful and perhaps to put into the record something on the issue of negligence itself. Negligence is different. It covers the situation where perhaps an incorrect document or incorrect information has been supplied by someone who has failed to take reasonable care to ensure its accuracy. It is that duty of reasonable care which is important, and I would direct the noble Baroness to focus on that issue. Reasonable care must be exercised in providing information and providing documentation. That the core of the issue.

<P>

<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-20_para9"></a>
Clause 14(2) enables the board to provide the information for the purposes of functions relating to statutory paternity pay or statutory adoption pay.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para10"></a>On the basis that proceedings before the tribunals should be as much a matter of public record as proceedings before an ordinary civil court, this does seem reasonable. On the basis that it would assist the departments receiving the information to carry out their duties of assessing an individual's rights and obligations more accurately than the system of guesswork, which is quite often indulged in when detailed information is not available, it also seems to be a very useful tool.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para11"></a>It is, however, the question of who should receive the information which is of some concern. In Clause 13(2), at the top of the list of recipients is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State or the department",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-20_para12"></a>
and Clause 14(1)(a) makes the same provision. It is the words "or the department" to which we object.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para13"></a>The Secretary of State must take full responsibility for what happens within his department. We cannot have a situation where a Secretary of State can disclaim any personal responsibility for what happens in his department by saying that it is all the fault of the officials, or that he does not personally involve himself in such matters. Exercising your Lordships' great restraint, which I often do not do, I am not going to draw any analogies with some recent events.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para14"></a>Of course, we all know perfectly well that the data will not be personally handed to the Secretary of State in his Red Box. Everywhere in legislation, in the Bill, we see that "the Secretary of State shall" do this or "the Secretary of State shall" do that, and in at least one case "the Secretary of State may". We do not see "the Secretary of State or the Department shall" do this or that. I cannot see any valid reason why in these two clauses there should be a departure from the time-hallowed phraseology.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para15"></a>Your Lordships will notice that I do not propose to remove the words "or the department" from subsections (b) in the two clauses because there it is quite clear that the information is to be passed to a person, not to a department, and that such a person is the responsibility of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para16"></a>The object of the amendment is to make the Secretary of State take full and total responsibility for the actions carried out in his name by his department. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In drafting the Bill the words "Secretary of State" mean the Secretary of State for the relevant department, and through the Secretary of State, his department itself; the DTI or DWP as the case may be. The word "department", however, means something different. It is defined in Clause 16 of the Bill and is defined to mean the department in Northern <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ireland which has responsibility for the relevant issues. It is, I believe, the convention in legislation to cover Northern Ireland's interest in this way; for example, in the Social Security Administration Act 1992. So against this background I am afraid that the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, in deleting references to "the Department" would remove that possibility. They would mean that people in Northern Ireland would not get what one might describe as a connected-up, or joined-up service from the government departments handling their statutory paternity and adoption pay matters.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para17"></a>I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, does not intend such a disparity to exist, and following this debate she will happily withdraw, or perhaps less happily, withdraw her amendments.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para18"></a>I turn to the Government's amendment, drawing together the data-sharing provisions of the Bill. We did not include the equivalent of the Department of Trade and Industry in Northern Ireland, the Department for Employment and Learning. This I willingly concede is an oversight on our part. In the same way as the Department of Trade and Industry as well as the DWP will have an interest in the schemes in Great Britain, so too will their Northern Ireland equivalents. As I said, the term "department" is defined in Clause 16, and our amendment to this clause simply includes the Department for Employment and Learning, as well as the Department for Social Development within the data-sharing provisions.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para19"></a>With an apology, I would like to invite noble Lords to accept the amendment to Clause 16, which will ensure that departments in Northern Ireland are able to take a joined-up approach to statutory paternity and adoption pay just as departments in Great Britain can. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   May I return to the amendment of noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, because that is where I believe we are. I cannot understand why, if she does not like "or the Department" in Clause 13(2)(a), she leaves it in in Clause 13 (2)(b). Again, she does not like it in Clause 14(1)(a) where she takes it out, but she leaves it in in Clause 14 (1)(b). It is there twice and it disappears twice. Why is this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-20_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thought I made that clear, though perhaps I will come back to that bit again. The point I was making was that I was not proposing to remove the words "or the Department" from subsection (b) because it is quite clear in subsection (b) that the information is to be passed to a person, not to the department. It makes that quite clear. Such a person would obviously then be the responsibility of the Secretary of State. That was the difference that I saw and I hope the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, can see the difference that I thought I was making, and was making perfectly clearly.
<P>

<a name="20313-20_para20"></a>I have listened carefully to what the Minister said in response to my amendments, and indeed what he said to the Government's own amendment, Amendment No. 53. At one stage he said, "I hope the noble Baroness, with apology". I am not sure whether he was <P>

"( ) Any shortfall in the employee's contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme during a period or periods of ordinary maternity leave, ordinary adoption leave or statutory paternity leave attributable to statutory pay during that leave will be paid by the employer."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20313-21_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: Perhaps I should start by thanking the Committee for bearing with me.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para5"></a>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the ambiguity over the interpretation of existing rules for ordinary maternity leave. Under the current provisions for ordinary maternity leave, an employee is entitled to benefit from her usual terms and conditions, save remuneration, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. When an employee is on a period of ordinary maternity leave, the employer has to contribute to any defined contribution pension scheme as if the employee were at work and receiving normal pay. The employee, however, under Schedule 5 of the Social Security Act 1989, can only be required to contribute in proportion to the actual amount of money she receives. As a consequence, unless an employee is receiving her full contractual pay during her ordinary maternity leave, there will be a difference between the rate at which the employee would normally contribute and the contribution she makes during her ordinary maternity leave.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para6"></a>I understand that when the provisions of Schedule 5 of the Social Security Act 1989 were implemented, the original advice from the DSS was that the employer had to make up the shortfall. This advice, however, has subsequently been retracted but the legal position on the point is not clear. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that employees' contributions have to be <P>


<a name="column_CWH46"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matched up to the defined limit, notwithstanding the reduction in the salary received during ordinary maternity leave. However, it should be clear that in circumstances of unpaid family leave, such as additional maternity leave and, presumably in future, additional adoption leave, employers should not be required to make any contributions since, in those circumstances, there are no obligations on them to continue to provide the benefits of contractual terms and conditions. The amendment is strongly supported by the Law Society. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am not aware that there is any ambiguity in the current law. Under the Employment Rights Act, women on ordinary maternity leave are entitled to their normal terms and conditions of employment, except for remuneration.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para7"></a>This means that employers are obliged, in respect of all other terms and conditions of employment, to continue providing the employee with the same benefits as they did before the period of maternity leave began. This includes access to, and contributions to, occupational pension schemes. Employers must contribute to these schemes, or indeed to personal pension schemes where appropriate, in the same way as before.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para8"></a>I believe this is both readily understandable, and right, in that it keeps pensions in line with all other terms and conditions of employment. The effect of the amendment would instead be to put an additional obligation and burden on the employer; namely, to make good any shortfall, and thus to take pensions provision out of line with other aspects of employment. I do not believe that it would be right to impose this additional burden.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para9"></a>I do not know whether the DSS advice in 1989 was different from the current advice, but there is no ambiguity about the current advice which the DWP gives to employers and it is as I set out above.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para10"></a>On that basis, I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, would he not accept that there is ambiguity in the Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 71(4), which he quoted, which states that under the current provision for ordinary maternity leave an employee is entitled to benefit from her usual terms and conditions save for remuneration? Any normal reading of those words would indicate that a temporary drop in salary or wages under the ordinary maternity leave provisions would not affect the pension contributions which the employer was making. That would have been the normal assumption from that wording. It has not been appreciated by a number of people that that meant that an individual during this period would receive lower pension contributions and that the employer would not simply cough up the shortfall that the employee would otherwise suffer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It is quite clear that in this case what the employer does continues to be the same. I refer to employers undertaking to provide a <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>defined contribution. They would go on providing that, but they are not required to make up the balance of costs. They are obliged to pay the appropriate contribution rates set out in the scheme rules, and that continues to apply in respect of women on ordinary maternity leave. The question is: do they make it up? The answer is no.

<P>

<a name="20313-21_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to extend the period of calculating entitlement to existing and new categories of statutory payments from eight weeks to one year. The purpose of this is to remove anomalies that would otherwise distort the calculations.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para17"></a>The calculation of normal weekly earnings determines two things for the purposes of statutory maternity pay. First, it is one of the criteria for entitlement to statutory maternity pay. So assuming that she meets all the other qualifying criteria, a woman will be entitled to statutory maternity pay if her normal weekly earnings for the eight weeks ending with the qualifying week are at least the lower earnings limit for paying national insurance contributions. The qualifying week is the fifteenth week before the expected week of confinement.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para18"></a>The second criteria for which this is relevant is that if a woman qualifies under this earnings condition, the rate at which her statutory maternity pay will be payable during the first six weeks will be 90 per cent of her normal weekly earnings.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para19"></a>A number of noble Lords will already have had experience of the anomalies that can be created by the eight-week definition. First, if a woman works additional overtime during the period in question, or, more commonly, reduces her hours prior to taking her statutory maternity leave, this distorts the calculation of her normal weekly earnings. Secondly&#151;this can be significant when manipulation sometimes takes place&#151;if an annual bonus becomes payable during the eight-week period, it will count as earnings and significantly inflate the calculation.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para20"></a>If, as is more likely, any such bonus does not become payable in the eight-week period, conversely the woman would be under-compensated in relation to the calculation. By extending the calculation period to one <P>

<A NAME="20313-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The amendment seeks to extend the period over which a woman's average weekly earnings are calculated, from eight weeks to 52 weeks. The noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Sharman, wish to ensure that a woman's earnings-related statutory maternity pay entitlement is a fair reflection of her earnings so that she receives neither less nor more SMP than she might have expected to get because of temporary dips or increases in her earnings over the calculation period.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para21"></a>I want to reassure the noble Lords that we, too, want to achieve the same result. But it is important to do so in a way that is fair to the individual woman and at the same time fair to the employer, who has to administer the scheme, by ensuring that the formula used is as straightforward and as simple to operate as possible.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para22"></a>When we considered ways of simplifying SMP, we looked very carefully at the rules dealing with the calculation period of average weekly earnings. In our consultation we explored the possibility of assessing pay over a 26-week period. However, the consultation revealed the consensus view that the existing method of establishing average weekly earnings provides the best balance between a representative reflection of a woman's earnings and a straightforward calculation for employers.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para23"></a>That was particularly true for small employers who were perhaps not supported by elaborate payroll systems and were extremely concerned that they would have to interrogate pay records for a longer period than the existing eight weeks. The suggested change to 52 weeks would lengthen by a considerable margin the relevant period for calculating earnings. That period is currently eight weeks. While I sympathise with the motives of the noble Lords in putting forward the amendment, I have strong reasons for not going down such a path.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para24"></a>First, perhaps I may explain what the calculation is all about. The aim of the average-earnings calculation is to arrive at a reasonable reflection of a woman's earnings during her pregnancy in order that she may receive earnings-related SMP, which is paid as a proportion of those earnings. The aims of the SMP scheme are that it should be as simple as possible for employers to operate and that it should be as easy as possible to understand, so leaving the minimum room for disputes.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para25"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lords would mean that, in practice, employers would have to examine pay records going back to a point at least 15 months before the expected week of childbirth. Members of the Committee will see that the suggested 52-week period ends with the last normal pay day to fall before the start of the 14th week before the expected week of childbirth.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para26"></a>I believe it is doubtful whether such a period could be used because it is outside the maximum period laid down in the Pregnant Workers Directive&#151;that is, the EC directive on the protection of pregnant workers and workers who have just given birth. That directive prevents member states taking account of periods of employment which are more than 52 weeks before the date of expected birth.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para27"></a>Of course, the eight-week period produces winners and losers. Some&#151;those who are paid more than usual during the calculation period&#151;gain from this system and some lose. A 52-week calculation period would also result in gainers and losers compared with the current system and might not produce a result that is a fair reflection of recent earnings. For example, a pay rise awarded in the latter part of the period would be averaged over the whole 52 weeks.
<P>

<a name="20313-21_para28"></a>For all its faults, the current system is at least clear and avoids the need for difficult judgments. That is important in minimising disputes and delays in payments. I fear that the approach put forward by the noble Lords is not desirable or possible for the reasons I have explained. Therefore, I invite the noble Lords to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble friend will appreciate that what he has just said involves all the anomalies put forward by the Law Society. No doubt those have been considered, but he has not explained why they are not anomalies. I refer, for example, to situations where a woman earns additional overtime, where she receives an annual bonus, where she is sick during the eight-week period and where she has irregular pay periods. The Law Society argues&#151;credibly, I believe&#151;that all those situations can produce anomalies and injustices with regard to the amount calculated on an eight-week basis.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para0"></a>I quote the Law Society's opinion. That states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By extending the calculation period to one year (or the period of employment or the period of employment where shorter) the amendment will remove the current anomalies identified above".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-22_para1"></a>
That is the same amendment as that moved by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. My noble friend has not said anything at all that addresses those anomalies. Indeed, he suggested that the Government had considered a 26-week period but that was too harsh on some employers. That is my understanding of what he said&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong. He referred to small and medium-sized employers especially, who apparently can divide, multiply or add by eight but whose calculators do not seem capable of dealing with 26 or 52. That is highly improbable. I say to my noble friend that if that is the best that the Government can do in response to a very carefully thought-out attempt by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall&#151;it is supported by the body that supports solicitors, many of whom deal with these problems throughout the land&#151;it does not bode well for the amendments that are to come. Can my noble friend improve on what he has said?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I have not said that I can&#151;the case was put so simply and well that there is no need for improvement on it. My point is that there <P>


<a name="column_CWH50"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a balance of interests, which will not necessarily work in favour in this context. With the longer period, one will not remove all the anomalies. I made the point clearly. If one has a wage increase towards the end of the period, one will get a situation in which that is averaged over 52 weeks, which will not necessarily produce a fairer result.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para2"></a>The argument about small employers is not to do with the use of calculators; it is to do with the fact that one has to do a great deal of work by going back through the records. If one does not have a computerised system, that is not necessarily easy to do. Therefore, in terms of administration and the fact that one will get anomalies under both systems, it was felt&#151;there was a wide consensus on this&#151;that the way we proposed of sticking with eight weeks was the best approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I do not wish to add to the difficulties of the Minister. I know what it is like when the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, with his vast experience, makes comments about difficulties, and I know that it might be difficult to find a suitable answer.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para3"></a>Earlier this afternoon, I moved three amendments relating to the phrase "normal earnings" and I suggested that the word "average" would be better. The Minister said that it was not absolutely necessary or right&#151;I forget the exact phrase that he used. I bring that up in relation to this amendment because the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, has very carefully talked about "the first normal pay day of her employment" and so on and because the word "normal" appears in the amendment. However, the Minister in his reply mentioned "average earnings", but did not use the word "normal", which I find somewhat confusing.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para4"></a>I wish to ask the Minister about a matter of which my noble friend Lady O'Cathain reminded me. For example, the earnings of an air hostess are much higher than the earnings of ground staff but, if an air hostess becomes pregnant, she clearly cannot fly but she can be transferred to work on the ground and may be classified as ground staff. Her earnings would be much less than when she was flying. According to the Minister, it would be difficult for him to come up with criteria relating to her normal earnings in order to work out her entitlement, whereas her average earnings would be very easy to work out from her two salaries. Could the Minister could enlighten us about what would happen in that case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   We make no attempt to pretend in this regard. Whichever system is used, it will be advantageous to some but not to others. So far as air hostesses are concerned, I do not know whether they get lower wages when they are pregnant. However, as I understand it, there are clearly winners and losers&#151;we are not pretending otherwise&#151;but there is a general view that there is nothing to be gained from taking the longer period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   Clearly, I shall withdraw the amendment. Before doing so, I hope that between now <P>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Report the Government will reflect on this matter. There is general consensus that any period longer than eight weeks will be better.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para5"></a>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that under Sections 220 to 229 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, 12 weeks is taken as the grid for averaging pay. That is applicable for calculating statutory redundancy pay, the basic award for unfair dismissal and pay during parental leave under the working time regulations. All the arguments that the Minister has used in favour of eight weeks would presumably apply also in relation to 12 weeks, which we would all say would be better than eight weeks. The Government's own legislation has provided for 12 weeks for averaging pay and we all accept that eight weeks is too short; anything longer would be better. I ask the Government to look at the issue again before Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20313-22_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments No. 57, 59 and 60. Amendment No. 59 stands in my name and Amendments Nos. 57 and 60 in that of my noble friend Lady Miller.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para12"></a>We come to the reimbursement rates of statutory maternity pay. The two sets of amendments tabled by myself and my noble friend are more or less the same, except that my noble friend is more modest&#151;or more realistic&#151;than I am. She asks only for 100 per cent, whereas, as will be obvious from the amendment, I seek 105 per cent. My proposal is designed to ensure that the employer is reimbursed for the costs that he has incurred and that he receives some compensation for administering what is to all intents and purposes a state benefit.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para13"></a>Before the Minister reminds us, I point out that his colleague said yesterday, at a very useful meeting on the subject, that it was a Conservative government who first reduced the rate from 100 per cent. That was done in relation to statutory sick pay as long ago as 1989 or 1990. I am fully aware of that because I was the Minister who introduced the relevant Bill in December 1989 or 1990. The parliamentary Intranet does not appear to go back as far as that, so I was not able to check up on my own speeches. Our Bill was designed to reduce the reimbursement rate for statutory sick pay. I think that statutory maternity pay came somewhat later.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para14"></a>I remember that Bill&#151;it is seared in my memory. It slipped through another place without any trouble whatever and it was only when it entered this House and was spotted by the eagle eye of my late noble friend, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that trouble blew up. He <P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>saw it for what it was&#151;a Treasury saving device masquerading as a social security Bill. Having said that, there was a rationale behind the proposal in relation to statutory sick pay. It was felt that by reducing the reimbursement rate, one could provide an incentive to the employer to look hard at sickness rates and whether people genuinely needed to take time off. Obviously, the same is not necessarily so true in relation to statutory maternity pay, which is less avoidable than sickness.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para15"></a>Treasury saving devices masquerading as social security Bills are not an uncommon occurrence under governments of whatever political persuasion. As I said, I remember that Bill well. I particularly remember the number of defeats we suffered in the then unreformed and allegedly overwhelmingly Tory House. I can assure the noble Lord the Minister that its passage here is seared on my memory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Late at night!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Not all defeats were late at night, because many were as a result of dependence on my own Benches. As I have pointed out, and I make no defence, Lord Boyd-Carpenter led the opposition through that particular measure.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para16"></a>Nevertheless, concessions were made, in particular to small employers&#151;and I am very glad to see that such concessions are still available to small employers in these measures. That is quite right. I also assure the noble Lord that, since that date, I have seen the conversion. Like St Paul, I now recognise that persecution&#151;and in this case, persecution of employers in general and small employers in particular&#151;is not a good thing.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para17"></a>Paternity pay, maternity pay, whatever they are, all impose burdens on employers. I appreciate that those burdens are not purely financial burdens. I appreciate that the mechanism whereby employers are reimbursed is very efficient, and gets the money back to them as fast as possible. Nevertheless, burdens are imposed on them which go beyond the financial&#151;particularly in the case of a small employer losing a key worker. They can impose pretty drastic measures.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para18"></a>The principal matter is that this is a state benefit that is being provided&#151;statutory maternity pay&#151;and it is the employer who is being asked to reimburse it. Therefore, the employer must pay it and then be reimbursed later on. I therefore believe that the employer should be reimbursed and should also be reimbursed for the costs of administration of this benefit. It is for that reason that I would like to move my own rather optimistic amendment to suggest that they should be reimbursed at a rate of 105 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para19"></a>I apologise for the digression to explain the past, but since I had been responsible in the past I thought I should explain exactly why I was now moving an amendment which appears rather contrary to what I had done in December 1989 or 1990. I beg to move.

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more modest, because I was asking for 100 per cent, not 105 per cent. I would not describe my amendments as more modest but I would tell my noble friend that politics is the art of the possible. While it might be difficult for the Government to accept the amendment for even 100 per cent, I feel certain that they will find a really good reason why they cannot accept the amendment for 105 per cent. Nevertheless, the intent of both of us is exactly the same; namely, that the employer should not be out of pocket by this particular payment.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para20"></a>Many employers are concerned that, once established, the Government will gradually reduce the employer rebate until it possibly disappears altogether. It has happened in other cases, so the proposal is not totally without foundation.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para21"></a>So long as the rebate is not 100 per cent, the employers are being faced with an extra business burden in having to meet what should be the Government's obligation. It is what amounts to a hidden tax. I would be very interested to hear the reason why the Minister will probably tell us that the Government are unable to meet our request.
<P>

<a name="20313-22_para22"></a>I must congratulate my noble friend on his openness and straightforwardness, in saying that his colleague and noble friend, the late Lord Boyd-Carpenter, actually pointed out that this was much more to do with Treasury control than anything else. No doubt that might very well be the case today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   This amendment seeks to amend the reimbursement rate of statutory maternity pay payable to large employers. The current rate of reimbursement is 92 per cent. By replacing that rate with 105 per cent, the noble Lord wants to ensure that all employers can get back all the statutory pay they have paid out, plus a little extra. The noble Baroness would be a little less generous but, as she said, politics is the art of the possible, or perhaps the impossible in this case, and her amendment would extend reimbursement to just 100 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para0"></a>It may be helpful if I start by explaining that when the SMP scheme was first introduced in 1987, all employers received full 100 per cent plus compensation for the employers' share of any national insurance paid on SMP. As the noble Lord said, the 92 per cent reimbursement for larger employers was introduced in 1994. However, we see no reason to change that.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para1"></a>It is perfectly reasonable to expect larger employers to demonstrate their commitment to employees taking leave to care for new families by funding a small amount of payments made to them while on maternity leave from work. After all, those employees who qualify for statutory maternity pay from their employer will have started work for that employer before their pregnancy began and many employees will have worked for the employer and contributed to the success of his business for some years before starting a family.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH54"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para2"></a>The contribution employers make to maternity pay is an investment for the future as mothers will be more likely to return to work if they have had an adequate period of time to recover from childbirth and arrange suitable childcare. Many of the best employers recognise this by topping up the statutory scheme and are happy to bear the cost of so doing.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para3"></a>Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to give you an idea of the kind of money we are talking about here. Let me focus on an individual woman earning &#163;255 a week on average. She will be entitled to SMP worth &#163;229.50 for the first six weeks of her maternity leave and then 20 weeks at &#163;100 a week, a total of &#163;3,377 in SMP. The employer is also liable to pay employer's national insurance contributions of &#163;143.54 on those payments so, altogether, he pays out &#163;3,520.54. Currently, he can recover 92 per cent of the SMP paid out, so he gets back &#163;3,106.84. If he could claim back 100 per cent as under the amendment of the noble Baroness, he would get &#163;3,377&#151;an additional &#163;270. If he could claim back 105 per cent, he would get back &#163;3,545.85, more than he has paid out in SMP and national insurance.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para4"></a>We feel that to enable all employers to recover their payments in this way is not right. It is different for small employers whose cash flows may be sensitive to even a modest additional cost. We believe it is right to protect them and that is why we are extending small employers' relief from April 2002 to bring in another 10,000 small and medium-sized employers a year. From 2002, 60 per cent of the employers who pay SMP in a year (or 40,000 out of 70,000 employers who pay SMP in a year) will qualify for small employers' relief and be entitled to receive 100 per cent reimbursement plus compensation for employers' national insurance.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para5"></a>You will note that the recovery rate for small employers is divided into two elements&#151;100 per cent reimbursement of the SMP paid out and additional compensation which is intended to compensate the employer for the employer's share of national insurance contributions paid out on SMP. At the moment, the compensation rate is 5 per cent but in April 2002 is being amended to 4.5 per cent. This rate is reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted in line with a long-standing formula that is set out in regulations.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord's amendment is in fact flawed. By replacing 92 per cent with 105 per cent, the amendment would ensure that larger employers would be able to recover more than smaller employers whose reimbursement would still depend on the two separate elements of 100 per cent reimbursement of SMP plus an additional amount which is subject to annual review. I do not believe that this is the effect which the noble Lord wishes to achieve.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para7"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness still leaves employers somewhat out of pocket by ignoring the national insurance costs. I am not sure if that is her intention. However, the real issue is whether or not a larger employer should be expected to make a contribution to help their own employees. I believe they should.

<a name="20313-23_para8"></a>Overall, with the improvements we are making to both statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance, the Government will be investing an additional &#163;355 million a year in payments to pregnant working women. In total each year we will spend nearly &#163;1 billion on maternity payments. The additional cost to a large employer in extra SMP and national insurance is around &#163;25 million. Overall we are asking them to meet around 7 per cent of the costs of SMP payments for their employees.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para9"></a>As I have explained, we think this is reasonable&#151;as did the previous Conservative government&#151;for employers to meet a small amount of the costs of supporting their employees on maternity leave. I therefore invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20313-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I am sorry that my amendments were protective and I will certain have a further look at them to see how they can be made non-protective before I come back to the subject again on Report. I am grateful to the noble Lord for spelling out just how much the amendment would cost, and I take it that last figure of the cost to the employers of about &#163;25 million indicates what the cost to the Government would be if the amendment of my noble friend, Lady Miller, were to be accepted. Therefore, I presume that the costs of my amendment being accepted would probably be something like half as much again.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para10"></a>It is always important to know what the costs of any amendment would be. Certainly back in my days in social security when the Lords seemed not to believe me&#151;I did seem to suffer defeat after defeat&#151;one used to keep a tally of the costs of all the amendments of the Opposition, so that one could point out occasionally how irresponsible they were being in terms of the expenditure of public funds. Similarly, on this occasion I will consider this very carefully before I come back to it. I am grateful for the explanation given to me by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Can I just point out so that everyone understands, the &#163;25 million is really just the result of the improvement in the terms that we are talking about. If the noble Lord's amendment were accepted, it would in fact cost &#163;120 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I understand. I appreciate that &#163;120 million is a much bigger sum than &#163;25 million, and I am always highly responsible about use of government funds. Nevertheless I will consider this amendment and that of my noble friend very carefully to see where and how they are defective before I make any decision as to whether to come back to them at a later stage.

"167A REQUIREMENT ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ASSESS IMPACT ON EMPLOYERS
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State shall, prior to the laying before Parliament of regulations under section 167(1), publish an assessment of the impact on&#151;
<br>
(a) employers in general,
<br>
(b) employers of five or fewer employees, and
<br>
(c) employees in general,
<br>
of the provisions of Part 7.
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State shall, on each anniversary of the date of publication of an assessment under subsection (1), publish a revised and updated assessment under subsection (1)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20313-23_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Bill introduces a large number of additional burdens on employers, particularly small employers, because the Government do not seem to realise the difference between what the Americans call a "momma and poppa" business and giant firms such as Tesco, Ford and Zeneca, for example. The Bill also confers additional rights and some additional responsibilities on employees. Nothing comes free in this field, such as the provisions that are included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para15"></a>I would like to remind Members of the Committee that the Opposition have in general terms welcomed the principles of the Bill, and in both Houses promised the Government their support. It does not detract from that support when we ask for an accounting of the cost to commerce and to workers of the new measures. I am not detracting from that support when I point out to the Committee some of the consequences that will or may ensue from the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para16"></a>Those consequences could include: greater wage expense to employers, with consequential loss of international competitiveness and trade; reduction in the number of jobs or even the potential and possibly unprovable discrimination against employing certain categories of people; an increase in administrative costs to employers; an increase in the number of officials and staff at ACAS to administer and enforce the new regulations&#151;I will be returning to the ACAS situation later&#151;and a rash of increased litigation before tribunals engendered by the currently growing compensation culture, although on the plus side the conciliation procedure proposed in the second schedule may head off some of that, as may my amendment to Clause 23 if the Government or the Committee accept it.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para17"></a>Of course, this list is not exhaustive. I simply wanted to illustrate the point that I have just made; namely, that the benefits of the Bill will not come free of cost and consequences. The Government have introduced the Bill without, I believe, any idea of what the cost will be to employers and employees alike; nor do they have any idea of what the benefits will be in cash terms. The personal social benefits to employees are perhaps much more easily discernible.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para18"></a>The amendment seeks simply to require the Government to account for what is happening and to show that the benefits obviously outweigh any of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH57"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disadvantages&#151;in short, to show that, overall, the consequences of the Bill will be a price well worth paying. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I support a subsequent amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, which relates to ACAS because at least it is relatively precise. I am not against attempts to try to work out the cost of Bills. In fact, we are now supposed to do that. However, she and the Government should understand that these assessments cannot be made with any degree of accuracy, and not only because the Treasury cannot count&#151;we all know that that is true.
<P>

<a name="20313-23_para19"></a>If one looks, for example, at the lunatic attempts in Routes to Resolution to assess what would happen if we managed to get rid of 40,000 cases, one will find that it is absolute nonsense. The figures are all based on averages of averages of guesses. Those assessments are quite silly. The figures&#151;even more exaggerated&#151;produced by the CBI do not fit with those produced by other employers' associations. Those figures always look on the downside because, in principle, they should be measurable. The data are not available but they should be measurable. They never look at the upside because no figures are available. One cannot compute what that might do for the welfare, security, morale or productivity of workers. It is an act of faith. We can rearrange the figures, but we really must not believe in them.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, agrees with the principle and that he has nothing against trying to work out the cost of things. It seemed to me that his difficulty lay with the list of items which I said might have to be considered. It may well be that an altogether different list will be produced. I was simply making the point that, if it were possible to obtain some costs from this, that might be worthwhile.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Before I begin, I shall assume that the amendment refers to the provisions of Part XII of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. That is the part which deals with statutory paternity pay, rather than Part VII, which deals with income support.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para0"></a>The amendment has two interpretations. It might require an assessment of the impact of regulations made under Section 167(1)&#151;that is, the reimbursement of employers&#151;to be published and revised annually. Alternatively, it might require an assessment of the impact of all the regulations concerning SMP made within Part XII to be published and revised annually. The placing of the amendment within Clause 21 suggests the first interpretation. Therefore, I shall respond directly to that, but the points that I make will apply to both.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para1"></a>The Government's policy is to regulate only when necessary and to ensure that such regulation is both necessary and effective. It is established government policy that new legislation affecting business must be accompanied by a full regulatory impact assessment <P>


<a name="column_CWH58"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unless the costs or savings are negligible or where statutory fees are increased by a predetermined formula.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para2"></a>The purpose of the assessment is to provide an analysis of the costs and benefits of proposals for regulation and a detailed assessment of any impact that regulatory changes will have on businesses&#151;in particular, small businesses.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para3"></a>The regulatory impact assessment for the SMP measures in the Bill was published at the same time as the Bill. However, a preliminary assessment of the costs was published in December 2000, alongside the Green Paper, Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice. It covers in full the effects of the two major proposed changes to SMP; namely, the increase in the rate of payment and the extension of the payment period on both small and large employers. There are no plans to add anything further to that assessment.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para4"></a>While these two significant changes to statutory maternity pay receive detailed attention in the assessment, the same detail is not required for Clause 21. The clause is largely a reworking of existing maternity legislation, but the changes it makes are undoubtedly positive for employers. First, employers will be able to recover their statutory maternity payments from tax and other allowable payments due to the Inland Revenue, not just from contributions payments. Secondly, employers will be able to apply for advance recovery of their statutory maternity payments.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para5"></a>These changes have no negative impact on employers and are comparatively minor in comparison with the increase in the rate and payment period for statutory maternity pay. That is why they do not appear in the accompanying impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para6"></a>Since departments already produce regulatory impact assessments, introducing a requirement for additional, annual assessments would be superfluous and time-consuming. However, we are fully committed to monitoring the effects of the new maternity package on employers and employees. For that purpose, we have commissioned a survey of parents and employers to establish a baseline against which the changes in maternity legislation can be properly evaluated. We envisage undertaking a further survey in 2005 to ascertain the effects of the changes made in 2003. Whereas the proposed amendment would limit annual assessment exclusively to the effect of changes to statutory maternity pay, the use of a more general survey will provide a broader picture of the effects of the changes to the pay and leave arrangements available to parents.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para7"></a>Finally, Members of the Committee will be aware that a change to the small employers' relief scheme will take place in April 2002. Regulations were laid before Parliament on 8th February and a full regulatory impact assessment was placed in the Library. That assessment details the effects of the changes to the small employers' scheme. It also gives a full account of the impact of change to the compensation rate from 105 per cent to 104.5 per cent, which was announced <P>


<a name="column_CWH59"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on 19th December 2001. Thus, the effects of employers' recovery of statutory maternity pay&#151;the subject of Clause 21&#151;are fully covered within this separate regulatory impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para8"></a>I hope that that assures Members of the Committee that there is no need to regulate for the Secretary of State to provide further impact assessments. Government departments are already committed to assessing the impact of new legislation on employers, so the amendment would add nothing to what is already established practice. I therefore invite the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="20313-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 61:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 32, line 10, at end insert "where in the opinion of the tribunal a party has in bringing the proceedings acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably, or the bringing or conducting of the proceedings by a party has been misconceived"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para13"></a><P>

<a name="20313-24_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: In view of what has been done earlier, it may be convenient if I suggest that, in relation to the amendments, we refer to Part 2&#151;my noble friends and I have tabled amendments to Parts 2 and 3&#151;because it will avoid saying such things when we come to the cases.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para15"></a>Three comments need to be made in light of our debate at Second Reading. The basis of our criticisms did not involve the Government's objective of settling cases at the workplace&#151;who could object to that?&#151;but the way in which the Government set about attempting to decimate applications to tribunals as a necessary part of that. The three comments have become more relevant in view of our proceedings today in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para16"></a>First, our amendments attempted to take account of what was said by my noble friend, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, who we are all happy to see restored to us here in Committee. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If we are doing it in the wrong way, I have no doubt my noble friends Lord Wedderburn and Lord McCarthy will seek to show us how to do it better. We shall listen with respect, as we always do, and we shall seek to come to a proper judgment".&#151;[Official Report, 26 February 2002; c.1405.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para17"></a><P>

<a name="20313-24_para18"></a>We understood that to mean&#151;I hope that this is true&#151;that the Bill is not set in stone. Whatever pacts and deals have been done about the Bill, I hope that the Government will listen and seek to come to a proper judgment in a constructive way.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para19"></a>Secondly, at Second Reading, we showed that the statistics&#151;or alleged statistics&#151;that the Government relied on to form the basis of their case, were in fact not sustained. They were not even sustained by their own <P>


<a name="column_CWH60"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>research, which was finally published just before the debate. I mention the horrendous model of wicked applications to the tribunals, which my noble friend, Lord McIntosh, will remember especially, and whose vital statistics were 64, 62, 37. Huge proportions of workers rushed to the tribunals without any attempt to reach a settlement, and their employers made no attempt to reach a settlement. That was not justified by the research and it is certainly not justified in real life. That led us to introduce, in parts of the Bill to which we shall come, a series of probing amendments, which touch on the unfair way in which the Government are aiming to reach their stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para20"></a>Thirdly, we are very conscious in our amendments of the procedure in Grand Committee. I quote from the House's Companion to the Standing Orders. At page 122, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The proceedings in Grand Committees are identical to those in a Committee of the whole House save that no votes may take place."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para21"></a>
It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The principle followed is that amendments may be agreed to in a Grand Committee only without dissent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para22"></a>
The following section states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If there is opposition to an amendment, it should be withdrawn in Grand Committee, to enable the House to decide the matter on report."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para23"></a>
We take this objective and statement seriously and we shall of course withdraw amendments where there is a single murmur&#151;let alone voice&#151;of dissent. The objective that we shall keep in mind, as stated in the Companion, is that we shall enable the House to decide any controversial matter on Report.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para24"></a>I hope it will not be thought that I have exceeded the bounds of order by introducing those three thoughts. I now come to Amendment No. 61. This amendment deals with the replacement of the power to make regulations for provision of the award of costs or expenses&#151;"expenses", of course, is the Scottish term&#151;in employment tribunals. That exists at the moment and, in our submission, there is a perfectly good regulation in the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2001, which deals with the matter. Regulation 14 provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where in the opinion of the tribunal a party has in bringing proceedings, or a party or party's representative has in conducting proceedings, acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably, or the bringing and conducting of proceedings by a party has been misconceived".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para25"></a>
It also provides that the tribunal shall consider making and, if it so decides, may make an order containing an award against that party in respect of the costs incurred by another party. That, of course, is quite different from the principle in the ordinary courts. It is different in a way that is measured and matched in all the labour tribunals and labour courts of Western Europe. It is one of the basic principles of justice in industrial tribunals, as they were called, or employment tribunals, as we now call them; moreover, in research people tend to refer to labour courts. A worker who is faced with the possibility that costs will be awarded against him if he happens to fail, albeit that <P>


<a name="column_CWH61"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he had a reasonable case&#151;and laymen as well as lawyers know that reasonable cases do not always succeed&#151;will be prevented in real life from bringing cases which it is quite reasonable to bring on the basis of injustice at the place of work.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para26"></a>This principle should not need to be restated. It was stated by the Donovan commission in 1968, and it has been accepted everywhere else, including in the Leggatt report, to which I hope the Minister will refer in his reply. The Leggatt report was on tribunals generally, and it includes extensive passages relating to employment tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para27"></a>Again and again, in Committee in another place, the Minister, my honourable friend Alan Johnson, said&#151;it is better in his own words&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To avoid doubt and bearing in mind our curious exchange about the explanatory notes, I should say that we are clear on the fact that the cost awards will not change".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Cttee F, 11/12/01; col. 58.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para28"></a>
Indeed, he went on to point out:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We must not get carried away with the idea that a large proportion of applications are vexatious or unreasonable. That is not the case. On anyone's assessment, the percentage is tiny".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Cttee F, 11/12/01; col. 59.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para29"></a>
The percentage is tiny as shown by the fact that there were only 247 cases last year in which any costs were awarded. That is not to say that some other cases may not have been unreasonable, but in that case they frequently did not survive a pre-hearing session. We come to pre-hearing reviews later in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para30"></a>There are few cases where the tribunals have decided that the ability to award costs is inadequate, or even that the existing power should be frequently used. I refer to the figure of 247 out of 130,000 applications last year, which was less than in previous years.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para31"></a>Why do I stress that? First, the Minister said that the Government did not want to change the basis on which costs are awarded in these industrial employment tribunals. If I may quote him again, he said at col. 60 of Hansard that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are dealing with the basis on which costs are now awarded, not extending it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para32"></a>
The Government have been clear that costs awards will be made on the same basis as they are now. The question that arises from that is not whether we can rely on the present Secretary of State. If the Minister says that in another place, that is what we expect our Secretary of State to do, but why take power to give the tribunals the competence to award costs on a wider basis? Why replace Section 13(1) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996? They are basically the same words, but why put it in without making it clear on the face of the Bill that the Government are secure in their understanding, as was stated again and again in another place, that they do not intend to increase the incidence of costs in these employment tribunals?
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para33"></a>Some people may say that that is a very suspicious approach. That ignores the fact that there has been a great deal of pressure to extend the ability to award costs. Indeed, we shall hear from the Conservative Opposition, as was argued in another place, that workers should pay more costs, should pay special <P>


<a name="column_CWH62"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deposits and make all sorts of payments before they have access to justice which is untrammelled in the ordinary principles of labour tribunals. Secondly, I refer to the pressure to expand the competence to award costs and, indeed, in some cases for tribunals to explain why they do not award costs. That is a quite extraordinary idea for anyone with any experience at all of comparative industrial jurisprudence.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para34"></a>The matter was also extensively examined by the Leggatt committee. The Leggatt report, Tribunals for Users, dealt with employment tribunals. At page 147 it said the following:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recommend a joint study by the DTI and the LCD on costs . . . In the absence of detailed research and a systematic review of the policy options in the light of it, we would not recommend the introduction of a general costs regime"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para35"></a>
I pause to say that that is in employment tribunals. The report continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that should be risked only in the light of clear evidence that there is a substantial problem and that change in the costs regime is the only effective answer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20313-24_para36"></a>
It is widely known among lawyers, laymen and trades union representatives of those who have to enforce their rights in employment tribunals that some people want to impose costs upon applicants beyond the present rules.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para37"></a>The Government have said in another place they do not wish to change the basis of the award of costs. All that this amendment does&#151;and if I may say so it is characteristic of our amendments in that it is a most modest amendment&#151;is say to the Government, "Put your words where your money and your mouth are and let us have it on the face of the Bill. If you will not put it on the face of the Bill, why are you replacing Section 13 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996? What do you want to do with these regulations for the award of costs or expenses? You cannot mean to have new regulations. Are you just going to print Regulation 14 out again and, if so, let us have a guarantee that that is what you will do"?
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para38"></a>It is difficult to understand the necessity of wasting a little tree to print Clause 22(1) of the Bill in that case. The Government have that power already. However, if all they have to do is reprint it, then let us say so. If not, why not clear the fog of doubt away and say to a future Secretary of State&#151;and I am not concerned with the present Secretary of State for the moment&#151;"If you want to exclude the possibility that tribunals cannot award costs other than on a vexatious basis, if I may put it that way, then you must come up with primary legislation"? Why are the Government so afraid of leaving to a future Secretary of State the obligation to come to this House and the other place and explain in primary legislation any extension of competence to award costs? The replacement of Regulation 14 is quite unnecessary; it is undesirable and the Government say they do not wish to do it. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>the amendment although I wonder whether it is necessary because in my experience we would always have abided by the rules suggested in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20313-24_para39"></a>I wish to ask the Minister a technical question. In the Explanatory Notes and in the Bill itself the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 is referred to in three different places. I spent quite a long time this afternoon trying to obtain that Act from the Printed Paper Office. Finally, I discovered that there was no such thing. It is called the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996. I wonder whether the Minister has already covered that point and replied to it. Perhaps I may ask him by what procedure an Act which has been passed and enacted is suddenly renamed in this Bill on page 32 and again on pages 76 and 80, possibly as well as in other places. Does a procedure exist by which one can rename an Act retrospectively? If so, can the Minister explain to me how and when that procedure was brought about?

<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not want to curtail the debate, but I should like to answer the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, while it is in my mind. The Act was called the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996. It was amended in 1998 and, when that happened, the title was changed to Employment Tribunals Act. Therefore, it is now properly called the Employment Tribunals Act 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. As I understand it, the date of the Act did not have to be changed to 1998. The date, 1996, could have been retained and the name of the Act altered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Therefore, why is the Act not available in the Printed Paper Office? I had great difficulty in obtaining it. Eventually the staff managed to uncover it, but it is still issued from the Printed Paper Office as the "Industrial Tribunals Act 1996".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not want to criticise them, but people in the Library would look up the Act in a book listing the statutes in force and would find the 1996 Act, as amended, including the change of title.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   They have some old copies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   That may be, but they had great difficulty in finding the Act. Perhaps the problem was that the staff in the PPO went through their list of 1996 Acts and did not find it. If an Act is subsequently amended, it should perhaps at least be cross-referenced to the year 1996 so that the authorities can trace it more easily.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Reading Clerk has noted that point.

<FONT SIZE=3>the sentiment behind the amendment and believe that it is common practice for costs to be awarded in that way.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para0"></a>Perhaps I may make a slight digression. I was pleased to see the proposal to insert new Section 13A, which relates to compensation for preparation time. I conducted a case against someone on behalf of a charity. That person lost the case, but it cost our charity a great deal of time and many thousands of pounds in preparing the case. There is a point to be made here. Perhaps that could be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not to award costs. The situation in relation to a charity is rather different. People who sit on an industrial tribunal, in whatever capacity, have less sympathy for a huge corporation than they have for a charity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Without responding to comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, in relation to what amendments I or other Conservative Members might table later or in relation to what we believe or do not believe, the noble Lord might like to know that I support the amendment. I took note of what he said with regard to the standing orders and how, if there were one word of dissent, the amendment could not be agreed. I hope&#151;perhaps without much expectation&#151;that the noble Lord does not feel the need to be that one voice of dissent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   As we are moving on to Part 2, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn properly introduced the amendment with some general comments about Part 2. I shall not be as ambitious as that, but I want to say something about Clause 22 because we shall be debating a whole series of amendments on it&#151;most of them tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para1"></a>There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about Clauses 22 and 23. Clause 22 is not in any way radical; it makes very few changes. It is in four parts. The first part is subsection (1), which substitutes the words for those in Section 13 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn said that it is generally the same. It is not generally the same; it is precisely the same. There is no change whatever in the wording of Clause 22(1)(1). Subsection (1A) is new, and all that does&#151;and we will come on to this with future amendments&#151;is remedy a defect whereby costs in the past could be awarded only against a party and not against the representative of a party. It recognises the case&#151;and this came up in the consultation after the consultation document last year&#151;where it is the representative who is at fault and it is the representative against whom costs should be awarded.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para2"></a>Subsection (1B) is about taxing or otherwise settling the costs, and that is identical to the existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para3"></a>Clause 22(2) is indeed new because it is compensation for preparation time.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para4"></a>I wanted to make that clear because the point that I want to make about Amendment No. 61 is that, in addition to the fact that no change is proposed in <P>


<a name="column_CWH65"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primary legislation proposed&#151;and this has been going for many years perfectly successfully; I do not know whether it goes back as far as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, would take us into the Donovan commission, but it certainly goes back over many years&#151;no change is proposed in the regulation.
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para5"></a>I can say without any qualification whatever that I agree with the principle which this amendment seeks to enshrine. The regulations which support the Bill will limit the cases in which costs are awarded and the circumstances set out in the current regulations are repeated in this amendment. What has survived for a number of years over more than one government without it being on the face of the Bill will continue both in primary legislation and in regulation. I put it to the Committee that this amendment is not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   I want to be clear. Is my noble friend saying that reference in subsection (1A) to a representative's conduct of proceedings&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We are not debating that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   I do not understand why the amendment to subsection (1) is being resisted. If I could have an assurance that what we are talking about is what both the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, and I know about, which are cases that a tribunal decides are misconceived, then this provides a way of dealing with that process, awarding costs against a party. As I understand it, this provides a facility for awarding costs against a representative of the party. Perhaps we can try again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I gave an introduction to the whole of Clause 22 because I thought it might be helpful. This amendment is not about subsection (1A) and it is not about representatives. It comes in line 10, it is about subsection (1). What I am saying about Amendment No. 61 is that the Bill does not change, and I give a flat guarantee that the regulations will not change. It works now; why change it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   It works both ways. If it be the case that nothing is intended to change, why are we putting something in the statute book which already exists in primary legislation? What is the point of putting it in if we are not going to change it? It is bound to make people suspicious, especially if you do not put what is in the regulations on the face of the Bill. I do not see why, if the Government want to reassure us at the beginning of the debate on Part 2 that they cannot accept this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I asked that question myself because it seemed a sensible question to me. The answer I have been given is that it is easier to understand if we have both the original legislation repeated here together with the changes that are <P>


<a name="column_CWH66"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposed to it in subsections (1A) and (2). Then it is all in the same place. It is not a matter of very great significance, but that is the explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   With respect, it is not all in the same place. If you took our amendment, what is now in another place&#151;namely, "vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably"&#151;would be in the sentence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The amendment uses the wording of the regulation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Precisely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew20"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Nobody has said it does not work. Nobody has complained that there has been any misuse of this provision in the regulations. Why change it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am utterly mystified. I had hoped that the Bill was not set in stone. I seem to be hearing stonemasons all over the place who have thrown away their tools!
<P>

<a name="20313-25_para6"></a>I thank all Members of the Committee who have spoken to the amendment. The Minister introduced the question of representatives and the amendment is not concerned with that. It is not about Clause 22(1A); it is about Clause 22(1)(a) in line 10. It is true that the Donovan report was not published at a time when such regulations applied. The Donovan report recommended that this rule should apply. The Minister rejoices in his support for this principle. He says it is the answer he has been given. I suspect I would rather have the answer he wants to give me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-25_spnew22"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, I asked a question, I was given an answer, which seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate one. You will not drive a wedge between me and officials on this matter. There is a perfectly good argument for saying that Clause 22 makes sense as a whole, including both the old parts and the new parts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I thank the Minister for his explanation and I shall look at Hansard with interest. I am not addressing Clause 22 as a whole&#151;I shall argue in the next sitting of the Committee that other parts of it not only do not make sense but that they are unjust and in one case in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, I am not addressing that at the moment and, with great respect, that is confusing and has already confused one of my noble friends who mistook "A" for "a"&#151;we do not want to get into that sort of thing. This is a very simple point.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para0"></a>The Minister says this rule has been basic. I believe he said it has survived more than one government and that is absolutely true. However, he cannot guarantee that it will survive every government who are to come in the next five years and he cannot guarantee even that a government in the near future will have to make a good argument to change it. What he is doing is refusing to put the rule in primary legislation. We cannot do more than put rules in primary legislation, <P>


<a name="column_CWH67"></a>

<B>13 Mar 2002 : Column CWH67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I appreciate that; we cannot bind our successors nor would we wish to do so. However, if we have it in primary legislation, the Government have to make an argument.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para1"></a>We all know perfectly well that regulations sometimes get through, without very good arguments, by vote and we do not want to leave this matter to regulations. We do not want the power in regulations to change the basis on which costs are awarded in our employment tribunals. We say there is a risk of that&#151;and we say it albeit that the Minister's advisers appear to treat it with some levity&#151;because there is a very strong body of pressure not least from certain groups of employers, not all by any means, which the Government know perfectly well, to change the rules in tribunals so that more workers have to pay costs. Indeed, you do not need to be particularly suspicious about the Bill. The power to award more costs and higher costs in the future under these regulations would be one way of cutting down applications to the tribunals. The Government want to cut out 40,000&#151;good, bad or indifferent, 40,000 have to go. How much better than to threaten costs against workers who dare to assert their rights in industrial tribunals. I do not for a moment think the Minister thinks that&#151;he understands perfectly well that that would be an atrociously unreasonable thing to do. He knows the real world, as we all do, and he surely understands that there is great pressure on the Government to do that. The Secretary of State would only have to pass some regulations the year after next&#151;that is what we are against.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para2"></a>My noble friend, Lord Gladwin, suggests that we want to stay where we are and that we want the rules not to change. The Minister in another place assured us that the rules would not change. The Minister today said that he also agrees that the rules should not change. Why not put that in primary legislation? This is not the last time that I will say that during the passage of this Bill&#151;this Bill is extremely dangerous. It is taking powers to make regulations that are wider than the objectives that the Government set themselves. There is absolutely no case for re-enactment&#151;similar words are used, although they are not put in exactly the same order, in paragraphs (a) and (b). There is no place at all for Clause 22(1).
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para3"></a>That is all that I am addressing. I ask my noble friend to reconsider this matter with his advisors. If he does not, we will begin to believe that this Bill, even on the most reasonable points and the most modest amendments, has been set in stone by some pact or agreement at a higher level, which allows ministers no flexibility in Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am sorry, but I must resist the proposal. Motives are now being suggested and officials are being accused of treating matters with levity, which I resent because it is quite untrue.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para4"></a>The full cost rules were not raised in Routes to Resolution. There was no question of that and no intention of introducing any change, whatever the pressure there might be; moreover, I give the assurance that there is no pressure.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   With respect, two points arise from what my noble friend has said. First, the Government may not have outlined plans to increase costs, but the Minister seems to have forgotten that they revived what we may call "The Lord Young of Graffham" principle from 1986 in their first proposal. That involves imposing charges on workers for going near the tribunals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The Government are the victim of their own announcements. If the Government are suspected, it is because they have said in the consultation document and throughout the Committee stage in another place that they want to get rid of one-third of tribunal cases. The whole thing is aimed at getting rid of 40,000 cases. How is that to be done?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble friend is right. I cannot forget the historical fact that the Government even began with a proposal to impose charges. Call it a charge, call it costs&#151;I do not care what it is called. Later on in this clause it is called a payment; we shall come to that. Nevertheless, however that is disguised in words, more money will be taken from a worker or there will be the threat to take money from a worker, whose objective is to enforce his rights in an industrial tribunal. That is absolutely indefensible.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para5"></a>I said at Second Reading that a right that cannot be enforced, and a right against which people threaten one with measures so that one cannot enforce them, is an exercise in rhetoric. It is not a right at all.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para6"></a>I had a second point, which I have entirely forgotten, in view of the interruptions. I shall read Hansard and make it on Report. I cannot think that my noble friend the Minister will wake up tomorrow morning and be convinced. I appreciate that the Government, as so often, it seems, are unable to say "Yes" to amendments to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20313-26_para7"></a>I have now remembered my second point. I am not suggesting that my noble friend would not be flexible&#151;he is the most reasonable of men. However, it looks as though this Bill is set in stone because no argument is accepted, even on the basis that Ministers will go away and think about the matter again. Usually in Committee, Ministers say, "All right, we don't agree with you, but we'll go away and think about the matter again". It appears that we are never told that; if we are not going to be told that tomorrow, I wonder whether we will be here later than we should be&#151;we are already here tonight later than we should be; we were given an assurance that Grand Committee sittings ended at 7.30 p.m. The rules are that I must withdraw the amendment, but we do not intend to drop it&#151;we shall return to it on Report, as the Companion advises. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

This specifically rules out any kind of coercion in matters relating to childbearing and reproduction.

<P>
<UL>Further to the speech of Lord Burlison on 13 February 2001 (HL Deb, col. 234) that "there is no intention further to restructure the Reserve Forces", whether any parts of the study known as Strategy for the Army (SFTA) cover the Territorial Army; if so, when the project was initiated; and what is its purpose. [HL3186]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313w01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The Strategy for the Army was made available to defence spokespersons and placed in the Libraries of both Houses in March last year. The aim was to develop a strategy for the Army which would consider the likely strategic environment in which it might be required to operate during the next 12 years independently, as part of joint operations, or as part of an alliance or coalition. A programme of work is currently under way, taking forward the themes of the Strategy for the Army. This includes looking at ways of increasing the contribution the TA makes to our defence plans within its existing establishment.
<P>

<a name="20313w01_para2"></a>In parallel, work on a new chapter of the Strategic Defence Review, following the 11 September attacks, is exploring the role that the Armed Forces, including the reserves, have in defending and protecting the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  The Government take the view that the environmental impact caused by the disposal of consumer batteries is largely attenuated by their burial as a very small element of landfilled household waste. Most studies of household waste in the UK have found the level of consumer batteries in the household waste-stream to be less than 0.1 per cent. The levels of heavy metals classified as special or hazardous waste is very low in most consumer batteries. It is an EU requirement for the level of mercury contained in the type of batteries used in torches must not exceed 0.0005 per cent.

<a name="20313w02_para1"></a>The Government welcome the European Commission intention to propose a new EU directive aimed at promoting greater recycling of consumer batteries later this year, but an analysis of the likely environmental impact and costs of an early draft commissioned by my department demonstrates that the environmental costs of small batteries collection can sometimes outweigh the benefits of material reclamation.

<A NAME="20313w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It is for local authorities to decide the level of their council tax taking into account the level of services they wish to provide, their statutory responsibilities and the wishes of their electorate. We have provided local government overall with significant increases in funding in 2002&#150;03. General grant to local authorities will increase by 5 per cent or &#163;1.9 billion. The increases in grant have enabled the Government to set a floor for councils with education and social service responsibilities which guarantees an increase in general grant of at least 4 per cent. Lancashire County Council benefits from the floor and will receive an increase in the coming financial year of &#163;26.673 million.

<P>

<a name="20313w02_para5"></a>As you may be aware, the Government's intention to transfer to Local Highway Authorities responsibility for around 40 per cent. of the then trunk road network (a process known as de-trunking) was announced in 'A new Deal for Trunk Roads in England' in July 1998. The aim was to get decisions on these roads taken at the level at which the relevant factors were best understood so that their management and improvement could be fully integrated with land use planning and local transport plans.
<P>

<a name="20313w02_para6"></a>The A570 was one of the roads identified for detrunking. Our intention is to transfer responsibility for it to the local highway authorities, Lancashire County Council and Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, in April 2003. The necessary De-trunking Orders have been published and we are meeting the local authorities to discuss their concerns about the proposals.
<P>

<a name="20313w02_para7"></a>In the run-up to de-trunking, we will be implementing a safety scheme to create a one-way gyratory system around the St Helens Road Park, signalise the junction and improve pedestrian facilities in the next financial year.

We are currently reviewing the guidance and will consult widely on the revised draft.
<P>

<a name="20313w03_para1"></a>The Secretary of State's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference. There will be occasions, however, when the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to call in a planning application to determine himself instead of leaving it to the local planning authority. His policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. He will in general take this step only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by the Secretary of State rather than at a local level. Each case is, however, considered on its own facts.

<A NAME="20313w04_wqn2"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the cost of running the Strategic Communications Unit for each of the years 1998&#150;99, 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01; and what is its estimated cost for the current financial year.
[HL3036]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313w04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   Costs for running the unit in each of the years were as follows:
2000&#150;01 &#163;957, 302
1999&#150;2000 &#163;838, 421
1998&#150;99 &#163;716, 672
<P>

<a name="20313w04_para0"></a>A large proportion of these costs are attributable to the continuing development and support of the No 10 Downing Street website, which is one of the most frequently visited government websites in the UK, receiving over 4 million hits a week.

<P>

His appointment takes effect on 1 April 2002 and will be for a period of three years. The position is unpaid and will take up one-and-a-half days per week.
<P>

<a name="20313w04_para1"></a>The Government would like to put on record their gratitude to my noble friend Lord Haskins for chairing the task force since its inception four-and-a-half years ago and building it into what it is today. He and the task force have achieved a great deal. We and the country owe them a debt of gratitude for their hard work and commitment to the cause of better regulation.

<A NAME="20313w04_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will provide a breakdown of the increase in Wales Office Annually Managed Expenditure Cash Plans (contained in Cm 5121, page 37) from the outturn of &#163;7,032,736 in 1998&#150;99 to the estimated &#163;8,059,563 in 2000&#150;01 [HL2798]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20313w04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The increase between the two years primarily reflects the outcome of the comprehensive spending review announced in July 1998.
<P>

<a name="20313w04_para2"></a>For 1998&#150;99, the Welsh Office Departmental Report for 1999 (Cm 4216) gives a breakdown of forecast outturn spending, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20313w04_para3"></a>Of the total managed expenditure for 2000&#150;01, some &#163;3.4 million was retained by the Wales Office to meet its costs and the remainder passed to the National Assembly for Wales for its use.
