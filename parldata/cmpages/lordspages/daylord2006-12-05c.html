<ul><a name="06120566000292"></a>What actions they will take to ensure that the gas industry improves the United Kingdom public&#146;s awareness of gas safety issues and in particular awareness of carbon monoxide poisoning.</ul>
<p><a name="06120566000013"></a><b><a name="06120566000298"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My Lords, it is vital that the public are made aware of the dangers of CO poisoning. On 27 November, I called a meeting with senior figures in the gas industry. They have made a commitment to new action on gas safety campaigns, with efforts to be co-ordinated by Corgi. I will lead a ministerial group and the Government will take a keen interest in the outcome and improved gas safety.</p>

Given the recent near tragedy in Gateshead of a classroom of schoolchildren being poisoned by carbon monoxide gas, and the need for the gas industry to give clear and consistent advice on gas safety, will my noble friend press the six major gas energy suppliers to ensure that they give that clear and consistent message and that they help Corgi, as the energy&#146;s watchdog, to pursue its excellent campaigns, which have seen a decline in the number of deaths from 50 to 18 in recent years?</p>

The figures also show around 200 serious injuries. My noble friend referred to the Gateshead incident, into which investigation is continuing, although, clearly, we were all very concerned to hear of it. There is no question but that we need to encourage greater awareness of CO poisoning risks and that the industry has a major role to play. I will certainly take his words to heart on that matter.</p>

My family gave me a carbon monoxide monitor, which seems fine, and they tell me that a less expensive variety is available. However, the danger with all these monitors is that, if they expire and people do not know that they are no longer functioning, they are almost worse than if people did not have them. Will he be sure to cover that point?</p>

If they meet the British Standard, they will function effectively. I understand that, if the battery runs out, a noise makes it clear to the owners that the detector is no longer running. The noble Baroness is certainly right: part of the awareness campaign is about encouraging people to invest in such detectors.</p>

If there is a lack of funds, would not the gas suppliers be excellent bodies to fill that hole?</p>

I am sure that it is able to invest in CO awareness campaigns providing the information that the noble Lord mentioned. It is worth making the point that the regulations were extended in 1994 to place requirements on landlords to maintain gas appliances in properties available to rent, which provides some protection in the case of students. On the more general issue, the Health and Safety Executive is conducting a review of gas safety, and I will ensure that that comment is passed to those conducting the review.</p>

I know that we are talking about an extremely serious situation here, but my pilot light went out. When the light was put back on, the company said that we should have a monitor, such as the one to which the noble Baroness referred, to ensure that the house was safe. However, that cost &#163;60 plus. Of course, I borrowed the money off my good friend Lord Davies of Coity, but other people cannot do that. Are the Government concerned about people in our society who would find that cost hard to bear?</p>

However, the action that he took was quite right. It was right to call in a qualified operator to look at it, and the operator was certainly right to encourage him to invest in a CO detection alarm. I do not think that &#163;60 is the current rate; I think that the alarms can be

However, I take his point that poor people may find that rather difficult. Various schemes are already in place to help such people with gas equipment generally, but my noble friend&#146;s point about CO alarms is important and I will make sure that the Health and Safety Executive looks at it in the context of its current review.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000022"></a><b><a name="61205-0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06120566000307"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, many years ago, in the days of coal gas, many individuals attempted to commit suicide by putting their head in the gas oven. Nowadays, natural gas contains such a minuscule concentration of carbon monoxide that that is no longer feasible. However, as has been said, it is clear that inadequate ventilation and improperly maintained gas appliances carry the greatest risk. One problem is a delay in diagnosis and recognition of what is happening. Are the public generally aware that carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin to give a bright red colour and that one of the earliest signs of carbon monoxide poisoning is that the individual is bright red in skin colour?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000023"></a><b><a name="61205-0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="06120566000308"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, we think of nothing else in Kings Heath. The noble Lord is quite right that there is an enormous lack of awareness, as has been shown by research commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive. That is why it is important that the industry is encouraged to finance some publicity campaigns. It is also right that health professionals need to be aware of the impact of CO poisoning and to be able to identify it. Part of the review process will be about the kind of information that needs to be given to health professionals, too.</p>

The Government&#146;s gradualist approach is certainly very gradual. My own route home to Cornwall and the high-speed service on the east-coast route between Edinburgh and London&#151;two of the longest routes in the country&#151;are covering trackside workers and nearby properties with a fine mist of effluent. Do Her Majesty&#146;s Government think it acceptable for railway maintenance work to be carried out in an environment that is contaminated by untreated human waste?</p>

The problem is that the trains have a long life of 30 to 40 years. Some trains would be extremely expensive to convert, and we cannot replace them immediately. Let me reassure the noble Baroness that the trade unions for trackside workers, which have been aware of this issue for very many decades, do not regard it as a health issue for workers on the track.</p>

Will my noble and learned friend not simply ask leaders of political parties, because they do not necessarily represent their members? Obtaining a consensus among 750 members will be difficult but some leaders of political parties find it difficult to gain a consensus with themselves. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, whom I have heard speak on two separate occasions, is finding it difficult to agree with himself.</p>

The Cross-Benchers have a Convenor who, although he does not represent them, is involved in the on-going discussions and loyally expresses their views.

When that body first met, its members were strongly divided between those who wanted a totally elected House and those who wanted a totally appointed House, with all shades of opinion in between. Under the very skilful chairmanship of that commission a real consensus was achieved. Does the noble and learned Lord agree that the consensus achieved then is still worth taking very seriously?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000062"></a>We are talking about a search for consensus after the report from the commission of the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham. Many people are now going back to the report and saying that there is a lot of good in it that perhaps we should have adopted at the time.</p>

<ul><a name="06120566000295"></a>On what grounds they based their decision to double the target for the number of schools to become academies.</ul>
<p><a name="06120566000066"></a><b><a name="06120566000348"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> My Lords, despite improvements in recent years, too many secondary schools are still failing to achieve high standards for the majority of their students. Academies have established a successful track record, as measured by fast-rising key stage 3 and GCSE results, positive Ofsted reports, strong parental demand and independent evaluation. We therefore believe it right that academy status should be available more widely, lifting the cap of 200 that was imposed two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000067"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="06120566000349"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply, but I think that the Prime Minister might have waited until after the National Audit Office report in January. Given that the Government&#146;s often-quoted reason for establishing academies is to rescue failing schools, is the Prime Minister expecting 400 schools to fail by 2010, which is about 10 times the current number? Why have the Government removed the requirement for sponsors to put &#163;2 million up front for each academy? Is it because the vast majority of them have contributed none&#151;or in some cases not the full amount&#151;of the money that they promised? Is this not really about the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000068"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="06120566000350"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, we never said that academies would only be replacements for failing schools; we said that they might be established in areas where standards are insufficiently high or where communities could benefit from schools with a stronger vision, ethos and leadership than exists at present. That would encompass the 400. On the changed sponsorship arrangements, we have linked those specifically to the integration of the academies programme and the Building Schools for the Future programme, which means that all the capital requirements for schools that become academies are now dealt with on exactly the same basis as for local authority schools in the area. It seemed reasonable to us that the contribution of the sponsor should take the form of an endowment for the schools rather than a contribution to the capital costs, as was the case before academies were integrated into the main local authority capital programmes.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000069"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew52"></a><a name="06120566000351"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> My Lords, the Prime Minister was reported as saying that he wants a large rise in the number of academies to secure his legacy. Given that we on these Benches support academies, from whom is the Prime Minister protecting his legacy?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000070"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew53"></a><a name="06120566000352"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, academies have nothing to do with the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy; they are there for the good of the country. We on this side of the House want steadily rising standards of educational performance and opportunity to be available to communities that have been deprived of them for too long. That is why we are establishing academies, and it is right that we should be&#151;as we always are on this side of the House&#151;ambitious in the targets that we set, so that equality of opportunity can become a reality in all communities, including more deprived ones.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000071"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew54"></a><a name="06120566000353"></a>Baroness McDonagh:</b> My Lords, my question comes from a different experience. My community in Mitcham spent many years trying to turn around two failing schools with some of the worst results in the country. We did so without any success until we approached the Minister for help to turn the two schools into academies. In a few short months, the change in the standard of behaviour inside and outside the schools is absolutely amazing.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000073"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="06120566000355"></a>Baroness McDonagh:</b> My Lords, is the Minister aware that 1,000 parents attended a recent open day to find out how their children could attend these schools? Why is his ambition so low when these schools succeed and there is a demand in these communities for them?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000074"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew57"></a><a name="06120566000356"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, my noble friend speaks with great knowledge of the situation in Merton. I visited those two academies; they are making outstanding progress in replacing schools that were not sufficiently popular or high performing in their community. I pay tribute to the two sponsors: the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Peckham, who does outstanding work for education across south London, and the Church of England, which is acting as the sponsor for the second academy and sees this as part of its mission, according to the Dearing plan, to expand the number of secondary schools that have a church sponsor in accordance with local parental demand. No one welcomes this development more than the parents who live in Merton; they now have the opportunity of sending their children to two rapidly improving schools where previously they were denied that opportunity and their children often had to travel many miles out of their locality to get good-quality secondary education.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000075"></a><b><a name="06120566000357"></a>The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and for his announcement of the extension of this opportunity. Does he think that there are lessons to be learnt from the sort of experience that we have just heard of that might be applied across the whole education system?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000076"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew58"></a><a name="06120566000358"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, that question would require a very long reply. However, I believe that the engagement of external sponsors, including the Church of England, has made an enormous contribution to the education system through academies and, potentially, through trust schools. In the diocese of Liverpool, the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church have come together to sponsor an academy jointly. I could not possibly speculate whether that has lessons for the relationship between those two churches in the future.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000077"></a><b><a name="06120566000359"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, is it correct that academies are not under the same obligation as other schools to admit children in public care and, if so, why not?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000078"></a><b><a name="61205-0002.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="06120566000360"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, the funding agreements that regulate the establishment of academies, which are binding legal agreements between my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and the sponsors, require academies to give priority to children in public care. The obligation does not arise under statute in the same way as it does for maintained schools, but it is enforced. I can assure the noble Earl that, in practice, academies take their duties in this regard very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000080"></a><b><a name="06120566000361"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman)</b> rose to move, That this House takes note of developments in the Middle East and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000081"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is almost one year since the first fully free and fair parliamentary elections took place in Iraq. Twelve million Iraqis registered for those elections. More than 75 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote despite intimidation and death threats from those hell-bent on ensuring that democracy did not take root. They voted for a non-sectarian Government in which the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds all work together. It reflects the Iraqi mix of strengths and weaknesses, yet these groups have never governed together in the past and had never attempted to do so.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000082"></a>In Afghanistan, too, it is almost a year since the inaugural session of the National Assembly, following successful presidential and parliamentary elections. The people of Iraq and of Afghanistan have overwhelmingly rejected the brutal dictatorships of Saddam and the Taliban. Yet today, Iraq is riven by sectarian violence and in Afghanistan the Taliban is fighting in an attempt to reimpose its fanatical ideology, devoid of any humanity.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000083"></a>Deeply ingrained grievances are dividing faiths and sects. A titanic struggle is under way between those committed to peace, stability and progress and those wedded to a perpetual cycle of violence. To avoid further descent into even greater instability and bloodshed than we are seeing now, we need a comprehensive strategy for the &#147;whole Middle East&#148;, as the Prime Minister said. That means supporting moderate and democratic Governments, building up partnerships with key strategic allies, promoting reform across the region and supporting further development.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000084"></a>Conflict and grievance across the Middle East feed off each other and fuel the flames of hatred on which the fanatics prey. We are striving to help Iraq bring the violence under control so that the political process can take firm root and the economy can grow. We are helping the Government of Afghanistan bring security, stability and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan by helping them defeat the Taliban and bring the narcotics trade under control right across the country.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000085"></a>We must reinvigorate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It is the one issue above others, as the Prime Minister has said, that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000267"></a>&#147;unresolved, allows extremists to gain purchase on the more moderate elements of the Muslim and Arab world&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06120566000253"></a>We have to keep up the pressure on Syria and Iran to follow a sound path, be constructive partners in the international community, play by the same rules as the rest of us and thus share in our progress and prosperity, rather than becoming increasingly isolated at the margins. We have to mobilise all the forces of moderation across the wider Middle East to take on the reactionaries and extremists and expose their ideology for what it is: empty, meaningless and without hope; a cult of death, never a force for the sanctity of life. 
<p><a name="06120566000086"></a>As the Foreign Secretary said recently, we are at a critical juncture in which the fate of Iraq hangs in the balance. The sectarian attacks are undermining the progress that Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s government of national unity, which is only six months old, has made towards reconciling Arab and Kurd, Sunni and Shia. It is a Government truly representative of the Iraqi people, with Sunni, Shia, Kurdish and Christian cabinet ministers, including four women. We are urging all of Iraq&#146;s leaders from across the political spectrum to get behind their Prime Minister and support his efforts to create a truly united Government and win the confidence and support of the public.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000087"></a>Iraq needs, above all else, a basic level of security. Last week the Security Council unanimously agreed to an extension of the mandate of the multinational forces in Iraq until the end of 2007. Prime Minister Maliki has made tackling the violence his highest priority. While the situation is particularly difficult and dangerous in Baghdad and the neighbouring provinces, it is worth the House remembering that just four of Iraq&#146;s eighteen provinces account for over 80 per cent of the violence. The other 14 are relatively peaceful. Of course, in recent history it has never been genuinely peaceful. The uncovering of mass graves holding the remains of those murdered en masse by Saddam&#146;s secret intelligence forces&#151;systematic, targeted and efficient murder&#151;tells a story that is wholly at odds with a history of peace.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000088"></a>Prime Minister Maliki has made it clear that the state must assume full control and have a monopoly on force. New legislation is expected by the end of the year on the demobilisation of militias and the integration of the military forces. As both the Foreign Secretary and the Defence Secretary have said, we have a clear strategy for transferring security from the multinational forces to the Iraqis. Two provinces, Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar, have already been handed over to the Iraqis, and the security situation there remains stable. We and the Iraqis hope they will be ready to take over Maysan province in January and Basra in the spring.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000089"></a>Even when all the provinces are handed over and the number of British forces in Iraq is reduced significantly by the end of next year, we will continue to train and mentor the Iraqi army and police for as long as they request our help. To help for that long is our sovereign choice as the United Kingdom state, taken knowingly by us and at no one else&#146;s diktat.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000090"></a>I take this opportunity again to pay tribute to the courage and determination of the British forces and civilians working in difficult and often highly  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1063"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1063</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dangerous circumstances in Iraq. In Basra British forces have been working alongside the Iraqi army in a joint operation, Operation Sinbad, first to re-establish security across the city and then to help improve the provision of basic public services, including water and sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000091"></a>Economic regeneration is also critical to the future stability of the country. Billions, not millions, of dollars are needed to get Iraq&#146;s services working properly. Much of that investment must come from Iraq&#146;s own substantial resources, but the support of the international community will continue to be critical to Iraq&#146;s economic progress for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000092"></a>The international compact&#151;a joint Iraqi-UN initiative launched in July this year, which brings together the UN, the World Bank, regional financial organisations and a number of states including Iraq&#146;s neighbours&#151;will, we hope, provide a framework for Iraq&#146;s future economic growth and integration into the regional and global economy. The United Kingdom has committed &#163;644 million to support Iraq&#146;s reconstruction; we have disbursed over &#163;500 million on helping the Iraqi Government plan and invest in basic services including electricity, hospitals, improving oil production levels and generating jobs.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000093"></a>The challenges in Afghanistan are different but no less daunting. The Taliban has tried to fight its way back in a major offensive against NATO forces, including our own, in the south of the country. British forces and other NATO partners have responded with exceptional bravery; as a result, security has improved. As the Prime Minister reiterated during his visit to Kabul on 20 November, and again at the NATO summit, we remain firmly committed to helping the Afghan army and security forces extend the government&#146;s control across the country. We will do that for as long as it takes and because it is our sovereign choice, done at no one else&#146;s diktat.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000094"></a>At the summit, NATO members agreed on the need to meet force-level requirements, to provide further equipment and to increase flexibility in troop deployment. Germany and France agreed that in an emergency situation their troops could be deployed to help those in difficulty. We are confident that the remaining gaps can be filled in the coming months. As the Prime Minister said, the mission in Afghanistan is not yet won, but the NATO summit made significant steps in the right direction to ensure that it is.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000095"></a>The narcotics trade, exploited as it is by the Taliban, remains a major obstacle both to security and to economic progress. It feeds corruption. Of course, this year&#146;s increase is disappointing and reflects the challenging security situation and limited law enforcement capability in the period before NATO moved into the south. However, in those parts of the country where governance, security and development have improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases have fallen further. The Afghan national drug control strategy is starting to have an impact. We and our partners will continue to support it.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000096"></a>The effort in Afghanistan is truly international; we have over 30 partners in the NATO mission there, with well over 60 nations contributing in different ways to  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1064"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1064</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Afghanistan&#146;s security, reconstruction and development. The UN mission in Afghanistan oversees 16 UN agencies on the ground, all helping the reconstruction effort. Despite the difficult security situation, Afghanistan continues to make progress. The economy has grown progressively over the past two years. More than 10,000 community councils have been elected across Afghanistan, implementing and setting up thousands of projects in health centres, providing water by sinking wells, or building schools. More than 5 million children&#151;one-third of them girls&#151;are now going to school. The Taliban used to kill girls for trying to go to school. More than 65,000 landmines have been destroyed in the past four years. The UK-led provincial reconstruction team in the southern Helmand province is working closely with the military to help improve educational facilities and water management and to help develop independent media.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000097"></a>Those are quick-impact projects, designed to improve the everyday lives of the Afghan people, pending the implementation of longer-term programmes. In Kandahar province, 1,000 wells have been dug and four large water reservoirs are in operation. New water supply networks have been created, roads and bridges built, power lines erected and transformers and generators installed. For the first time in decades, millions of Afghans face the prospect of a more peaceful and prosperous life. What testifies to this? Some 4.6 million refugees have decided to return home, one of the biggest return movements ever and an essential part of the reconstruction process. So there is hope. But we, the international community and the Afghan Government, must remain committed to the task.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000098"></a>I believe that there is now a glimmer of hope emerging for renewed engagement between Israel and the Palestinians. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has stated, a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians would be living, tangible proof that the region and therefore the world can peacefully accommodate different faiths and cultures. The ceasefire in Gaza and Prime Minister Olmert&#146;s offer to hold talks with President Abbas, end roadblocks and consider a prisoner exchange are all recent and encouraging signs.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000099"></a>The United Kingdom continues to work closely with the EU, the US and regional partners to help strengthen Palestinian institutions and improve security. We have committed &#163;30 million towards the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, making the United Kingdom one of the largest donors to the Palestinians. We played a key role in developing the temporary international mechanism by which assistance can be channelled to the Palestinian people while bypassing the Hamas-run finance ministry. We have already announced that we intend to contribute &#163;12 million through this temporary mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000100"></a>We remain concerned at the humanitarian issues affecting Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, which is why the EU is contributing some &#8364;650 million to the Palestinian people&#151;more this year than ever before. We have offered President Abbas our full support in putting together a Government of national unity; that is critical to taking forward the peace process. Such a  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1065"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1065</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government will enjoy our full support. We have made it clear that we would be prepared to work with any Government based on the quartet&#146;s three principles: renunciation of violence; recognition of Israel; and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. I repeat that new energy is plainly needed in the peace process. The Prime Minister is committed to it and it is vital that the United States engages. But I also see a key role for the European Union. That should be a persistent role of negotiation, mediation and helping build durable regional systems.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000101"></a>We remain concerned about the role of Syria and Iran in Lebanon and their support, in terms of weapons and funds, for Hezbollah. At a meeting with Prime Minister Siniora last weekend, the Foreign Secretary made clear that the United Kingdom fully supported the constitutional and elected Government of Lebanon and urged a peaceful resolution to the present dispute. We have long sought to draw Syria and Iran into being part of the solution for peace in the Middle East, rather than the problem. If the Syrian authorities are ready to play a constructive role in the region, we have made it clear that we are ready to work with them.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000102"></a>The same strategic choice faces Iran. For three years we, with France and Germany, have led diplomatic efforts urging Iran to address international concerns about its nuclear programme. We have built and maintained wide support for that approach. In June, for the first time, the United States, China and Russia explicitly endorsed the generous proposals to Iran which would give Iran everything it needs to develop a peaceful nuclear energy programme, while meeting international concerns, and open up opportunities for higher relationships with the EU and the wider international community. Instead, the Iranian regime has continued its activities in contravention of the IAEA board&#146;s and the UN Security Council&#146;s requirements. We have agreed with our partners, therefore, that we have no alternative but to consult on a Security Council resolution imposing sanctions. But even while our officials work in New York, our proposals remain on the table. Should Iran choose to respect its international obligations, they are the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000103"></a>The Iranian regime also has a choice about its respect for human rights and political freedoms. Many candidates who wished to stand in next week&#146;s local elections have been barred from doing so. Others have been deterred by the vetting process from putting their names forward. The Iranian people deserve a free and fair choice about their country&#146;s future, and the chance to elect representatives with a wide range of views, not just those picked for them.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000104"></a>While Syria and Iran remain reluctant to engage with the wider international community, the Gulf states and, increasingly, the countries of north Africa are embracing change. In the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar the process of modernisation is under way. Algeria&#146;s President Bouteflika has led a successful programme on national reconciliation. Morocco is firmly committed to strengthening the rule of law, safeguarding human rights and developing a multi-party

Libya is gradually opening up. Egypt is moving&#151;somewhat slowly&#151;towards greater political pluralism. The influence of civil society is growing right across north Africa. We need to build strong alliances with these countries, whose example can stimulate desirable changes elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000105"></a>As the Director-General of the Security Service has pointed out so chillingly, the threat to the United Kingdom&#146;s security from al-Qaeda and sponsored terrorist activity is growing. The longer that conflict and sectarian violence persist, whether&#151;and it is essential to note this&#151;between Israel and the Palestinians, or in Iraq, or in Afghanistan, the easier it will be for al-Qaeda to exploit human misery and attract misguided recruits to its destructive cause. If we back away, the victory is theirs. We have to show that our will is stronger than the terrorists&#146;. That is why the United Kingdom and all our international partners must stay engaged in every part of the Middle East, not only now, but for the long term.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000107"></a><b><a name="61205-0003.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="06120566000362"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, we are all very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, for setting out how the Government see the situation in the Middle East and Afghanistan. However, it may not be entirely the way the rest of us now see it. It is, as the Minister says, one of great danger. He speaks of &#147;a critical juncture&#148;, which is, indeed, the point we have reached. Iraq is, again in the Minister&#146;s words, &#147;riven by violence&#148;. The situation is fast-changing and the world is looking for new approaches. The question now is whether we the British, our Government and our allies, have the resilience to offer that new approach.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000108"></a>Frankly, there is widespread feeling in this country that our foreign policy has begun to lose its way. As I said in the debate on the gracious Speech and now reaffirm, the direction and purpose of our national policy in this dangerous world now seem, through no fault of the Minister, to be in limbo. The Prime Minister has called for a &#147;whole Middle East&#148; strategy and the Minister repeated that call, but what is the content of that strategy? It seems that we are condemned to wait. We must wait for the Congress of the United States, through its Iraq Study Group, chaired by James Baker III, to declare what that means. It will do so very shortly, maybe even tomorrow. Meanwhile, we wait and listen, while in Iraq that brave claim of &#147;mission accomplished&#148; has, as everyone now recognises, become &#147;mission in chaos&#148;. That is unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister has given evidence to this congressional inquiry by videolink. It is worrying that our own Parliament should apparently be barred, for the moment, from asking the same questions. No one wants in any way to disturb or undermine the bravery and courage of our troops, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq or anywhere else, but questions need to be asked and issues need to be examined. It is interesting that the Congress of the United States apparently feels ready to do that, so why don&#146;t we?</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000109"></a>The time has come for bold, independent and creative thinking about the next steps in the Middle East&#151;we all know that. Our allies and friends, with whom, together, we can make the biggest contribution, should be not just the great American republic, much as we admire America, and not just our European neighbours, but also our true and real friends in the Commonwealth and Asia. There power and influence are growing&#151;this seems not to be recognised as it should be&#151;while, sadly, pax Americana slithers into tragic decline. If that sounds like a party preposition or deliberate criticism from the Opposition, let me say that I am very much fortified in these views by, for example, the recent speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon. The other day in Cardiff, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000268"></a>&#147;the recreation of British foreign policy is no exaggeration of our need. Worst of all, the worldwide stock of sympathy and good will towards the United States has largely disappeared&#151;along with earlier longstanding respect for the wisdom of British policy towards the problems of the Middle East&#151;which had once prevailed almost throughout that region&#148;.</ul><a name="06120566000254"></a>I may not share even my noble and learned friend&#146;s complete faith in the capacity of the united European Union to solve all these problems, but I know that when someone like my noble and learned friend Lord Howe&#151;one of our most thoughtful Foreign Secretaries of modern times&#151;speaks like that, it really is time even for the Prime Minister and his colleagues to stop, listen and think about changing course. 
<p><a name="06120566000110"></a>In a way, the elements of this &#147;whole Middle East&#148; strategy, which we are all searching for, are becoming easier to set out as the situation worsens&#151;I shall try to do so in a moment&#151;although it is very far from easy to take forward. What are they? First, a federal Iraq, with a carefully phased withdrawal of foreign troops, including the American armoured brigades, is, of course, something that people want. Perhaps it should begin next year&#151;perhaps the Iraq Survey Group will recommend it and it will take place province by province&#151;in the hope that there will be an Iraqi Government and authority strong enough to replace it.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000111"></a>We should hang on to that concept because a united Iraq remains totally in the interests of all the neighbouring powers and not just the western ones&#151;not just the United States and Britain but Turkey, Iran, Syria and Jordan. Indeed, that is why we have to bring those countries together with ourselves. Frankly&#151;this needs to be said&#151;that will not be done by threats. I heard the words of the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, and I heard the Prime Minister the other day, and it seems to me that the tone is wrong. When we are not in a strong position or are not the victors&#151;there has been no victory&#151;we will not get these countries to co-operate unless it is done in the proper way. That is the first requirement of the new whole-strategy.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000112"></a>Secondly, obviously we want a fully independent Palestine with&#151;I know that this is a long shot&#151;world-backed security guarantees as far as possible for the Israeli people. My impression is that an increasing number of people in Israel see that this is the only future, even if some people in Washington do  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1068"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1068</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not yet see that. Perhaps there will be a change, and that is the ray of light to which the Minister referred. </p>

<p><a name="06120566000113"></a>Thirdly, there has to be some kind of nuclear bargain which includes letting Iran have its civil nuclear power, which it is well on the way to getting, and faces the difficult issue of persuading Israel&#151;again, in exchange for guarantees&#151;to give up its nuclear weapons and Iran to hold back from its drive for full nuclear military weaponry. It may be that here, too, new thinking is required and that the proposals for building on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty with a concept of an international nuclear fuel bank&#151;an idea being developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which I visited the other day&#151;are the way forward. I do not know, but certainly new thinking is required, which the UN and the IAEA seem to recognise.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000114"></a>Iran really wants the respect that it feels should be accorded to a major regional power. It has a common interest, along with the rest of us, in wanting Iraq to stay in one piece. So does Syria, whose current regime also, understandably, wants some guarantee of its own continued existence. As we all know, it operates through a minority inside Syria. That is all right, but unfortunately Syria also wants to re-establish its dominance of Lebanon. The noble Lord did not mention that, but I fear that that is where the whole idea of a grand bargain or a successful regional conference could begin to unravel, because that dominance is the one thing that Syria cannot have.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000115"></a>At the moment it is straining every sinew to disrupt Lebanon. I do not know whether it was implicated in the latest assassination, the murder of Pierre Gemayel&#151;none of us knows the murky reality behind that&#151;but Syria is at the moment organising ersatz rallies with heavy payments to rent-a-crowd, flag-waving attendees, largely imported by bus every day from Syria. The ever-gullible BBC duly reports those gatherings as bigger and livelier than that of the quiet Christian crowds the other day at Gemayel&#146;s funeral&#151;hardly surprising given that it was a funeral. </p>

<p><a name="06120566000116"></a>I raise that because it is in little Lebanon that all the attempts to bring the Middle East nations to their common senses and achieve some unity of approach could fail; that could be the spark. As someone said the other day, if it is possible to compare a country to a canary in a mineshaft, that is it. We see all the signs of a possibly far greater conflagration throughout the area, with several civil wars breaking out at once. If Hezbollah is allowed to satisfy its power lust through street violence and demonstrations and to extend the sway of its paymasters, Iran and Syria, then stability, sanity and justice will have lost out in the Middle East and every remaining nation will be directly threatened, from Jordan to Saudi Arabia and from the Gulf states to Egypt.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000117"></a>That is why we need more than rhetoric to back the Siniora Government, whom the Minister mentioned. That should come not just from the West but also from the new great powers, Russia, India, China and Japan. There is everything to be said for American policy taking a back seat in these matters, which is why we must be very careful about poking at Russia with constant criticism, tempting as it is with all the  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funny goings-on about which we have been reading in London and the talk of spying. I urge those who would listen that we must not allow that to dominate our thinking about our relations with Russia. Mr Putin is not an enemy of the West. A responsible Russia is an essential part of the equation in stopping the whole Middle East region from slipping into anarchy. We have to keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000118"></a>I have said very little about the other aspect of the debate, Afghanistan. At the end of the debate my noble friend Lady Rawlings will have many more detailed observations to make on the challenges there. Suffice it to note that I believe that things in Afghanistan are probably not nearly as bad as the media tell us. We also have to remember that Afghanistan is a collection of tribes rather than a nation, as it always has been. Anyone who reads the first five pages of any book on Afghanistan, from Lord Roberts onwards down the decades, will know that perfectly well.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000119"></a>A choice must be made by the outside powers, including NATO, either to deploy an infinitely greater military and politically intricate effort than anything we have seen so far, including skills to deal with the tribes, as well as the ceaseless incursions from Pakistan and the support of the Pashtun. Incidentally, we used to have those skills but we seem to have lost them. It is either that, a much bigger commitment, or a military exit. There is no middle solution and we know that perfectly well. Like the Russians before us, and our forefathers, we all know that perfectly well and have painfully discovered it. There must now be that degree of reality.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000120"></a>We are coming to a critical juncture in our relations with the rest of the world. I have my own solutions on choosing allies and friends in the days ahead, and how to radically reduce our dependence on the dangerous Middle East for oil and energy, but I shall not weary the House with those now; we can debate them another time. We all know perfectly well that the present policies have failed and that new dynamism and imaginative vigour are required in our approach to the eternally complex Middle East and its neighbours if the present slide to worse chaos is to be checked. Of that vigour and imagination I see very little sign in Her Majesty&#146;s Government.</p>

I particularly welcome the large number of speakers from the Cross Benches. One of the many positive effects of the partial reform of the House of Lords, which we have undertaken in the past eight years, has been a much more active and expert contribution from the Cross Benches, which we used to have when I first came to the Chamber. We benefit from that particularly in debates on foreign affairs.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000122"></a>Our main focus in this debate must be on the linked crises in the Middle East, on the British, European and NATO engagement with those crises, on the parallel NATO commitment to Afghanistan, and the strain that those operations place on Britain&#146;s Armed Forces. My noble friend Lord Garden will deal later with  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1070"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1070</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>military overstretch, and my noble friend Lady Williams will say rather more on Afghanistan. I want to focus primarily on the Middle East and on the appropriate balance to be struck between British, European, transatlantic and UN engagement in British diplomacy over the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000123"></a>Nevertheless, I have to say something first about how we reached the situation in which we find ourselves. As the Irishman said to the traveller, &#147;We wouldn&#146;t have started from here&#148;. British policy, following the ideologically driven mistakes of the Bush Administration&#146;s policy, has contributed to chaos in Iraq, a loss of six years in attempts to bring together the two sides in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the spillover of that conflict into Lebanon. In the United States, the voters have just exercised their rights to disapprove of the mess that their Administration has led them into, and their disapproval of President Bush in particular.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000124"></a>It is extraordinary that President Bush&#146;s closest supporter in the attempt to impose democracy by force on Iraq, Tony Blair, is still in office. It is almost as extraordinary that he has managed to avoid effective parliamentary scrutiny of the deceptions that led the UK into war in Iraq, the commitment of Britain to follow US policy, and the failure to exert any significant influence over that policy. I welcome the Minister&#146;s repeated emphasis in his opening speech on the sovereign and independent quality of the decisions that Her Majesty&#146;s Government are now making. I understand why he feels it necessary to stress that point against the record of the past four years.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000125"></a>Fifty years ago, a British Prime Minister committed this country to intervention in the Middle East on falsely presented evidence, without the full support of his Cabinet, and after deliberately misleading Parliament about the purpose of the operation. After an initial patriotic wobble, the Labour Party recognised that this was a betrayal of Britain&#146;s values and interests, and led the demands for Eden&#146;s resignation. Four years ago, it was a Labour Prime Minister who led the country into war in the Middle East on false premises, committing Britain to support an American operation over which we had no influence and which was intended to reshape first Iraq and then the greater Middle East as a whole to fit a neo-conservative design.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000126"></a>An initial patriotic and party-loyalty wobble in support of the Prime Minister was understandable, but I cannot see how the traditional values of the Labour movement&#151;internationalism, open diplomacy, the promotion of a peaceful world order&#151;are compatible with the drift of the Labour Government&#146;s Middle East policy over the past four years. We have bumped along behind a misjudged American occupation, deliberately excluded from influence over that occupation, while sharing with the United States the opprobrium of the Arab and Muslim world which the Iraq war and subsequent occupation have attracted. Yet the Labour Benches have remained almost silent and the Prime Minister is still there. I am proud that my party has stood firm in support of progressive international values while the Labour Government have forgotten them.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000127"></a>But we are where we are and the focus of this debate must be on what direction we should now take. The King of Jordan last week reminded us of the dangers of our current situation: that the Middle East could face three linked civil wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Israel-Palestine, unless governments within the region and states outside work together to avert them.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000128"></a>The British Government have least influence over the situation in Iraq. Central Iraq is now close to open civil war in four of the 18 provinces, as the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, points out, but with nearly half of Iraq&#146;s population. Inter-communal killings have been rising. The Iraqi army is struggling to defend a government who have only a very limited legitimacy. In the southern, British sector violence has also risen, including attacks on British forces. The occupation itself has now become as much a provocation as a protection against civil conflict. We do not yet know whether the Bush Administration will choose to raise the number of troops in a final attempt to impose a degree of order, or reduce them in the hope that the Iraqi army can now cope. But we should not simply follow whatever line emerges from Washington after the publication of the Iraq Study Group report<I>.</I> We should be putting the future of Iraq onto the agenda of a regional Middle East conference, drawing in all of Iraq&#146;s neighbours and co-ordinating the gradual withdrawal of British forces with their advice and assistance in preventing internal conflict from spreading further.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000129"></a>Iran is one of Iraq&#146;s most important neighbours. It is also one of Afghanistan&#146;s most important neighbours. I am struck, as I follow the appallingly misunderstood quality of the debate in Washington, by the absence of historical context and understanding. I read a few weeks ago an official in Washington quoted as saying that they have to resist Iran trying to establish itself as a regional power in the Middle East. Iran was a regional power in the Middle East long before the Pilgrim Fathers reached Massachusetts. Trying to prevent that seems to me to be a little idiotic.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000130"></a>The current regime in Tehran is authoritarian and nationalist. Its anti-western turn reflects, in part, the mistakes of American policy over the past 25 years&#151;supporting Iraq in its war with Iran; shooting down an Iranian airliner; cutting off direct contacts; and finally, labelling Iran as part of the &#147;axis of evil&#148;. It is difficult to persuade the Iranian regime to abandon the enrichment of uranium when it is surrounded by American forces in the Gulf and in states to the east, west and north, with Washington rhetoric still talking about bombing raids. We on these Benches have supported the efforts of the British, French and German foreign ministers to keep contacts open with Teheran. We cannot exclude Iran from negotiations, either on the future of Iraq or on Afghanistan. We need their co-operation and we gain already some co-operation towards both countries. Iranian influence over movements within Lebanon and Palestine also makes it a player there. In spite of the many unpleasant characteristics of that regime, our Government should continue their effort to build bridges to it, together with our European partners.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000131"></a>The same logic applies to Syria, a nasty regime in many ways, but a necessary player in any effort to resolve current conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon and Israel-Palestine. Syrian intervention in Lebanese politics reflects their assumption and their recollection that the Lebanon was historically part of greater Syria. But we should not forget that the Israelis, Americans, French and others have also claimed intervention rights of different sorts within Lebanon. Our party has also supported our Government&#146;s attempts to engage with Syria, while recognising that Britain&#146;s image in Damascus as the messenger-boy of Washington does not make engagement easy.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000132"></a>On all sides, however, it is recognised that the Israel-Palestine conflict is at the heart of the regional disorder, and of the alienation of Arab and Muslim opinion from the West. The Bush Administration invaded Iraq, after all, partly because of the widespread belief in Washington that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000269"></a>&#147;the road to Jerusalem runs through Baghdad&#148;:</ul><a name="06120566000255"></a>that removal of Saddam Hussein, ideally followed by regime change forced in Tehran, would enable the Israelis to dictate their preferred settlement to the occupied Palestinians. Chaos in Iraq has strengthened Iran instead&#151;and weakened Israel&#146;s position, so increasing Israeli anxiety. Israeli and American refusal to talk to a Palestinian Administration led by Hamas, like the refusal to talk to Iran and Syria, has made the situation worse rather than better. The blockade of Palestinian territory and the blocking of financial transfers have led to a humanitarian crisis, which is likely to breed further despair-ridden terrorism, rather than to create the conditions for constructive dialogue. We may hope that last week&#146;s tentative ceasefire between Israel and Palestine will hold, but we should recognise that it will not hold without active external pressure on both sides.
<p><a name="06120566000133"></a>It is unlikely that the Bush Administration, in its last two discredited years in office, will reverse its mistaken decision six years ago to abandon the Middle East peace process, and to identify American interests instead with those of the Israeli Government of the day. Republican calculations of how support for Israel plays in domestic American politics, particularly in the Christian fundamentalist south, are unlikely to change. American support for the project of a greater Israel, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan, rests on questionable theology and on disastrous political reasoning. I note that many within Israel question whether their national interests have been hijacked by American ideologues who do not have Israel&#146;s long-term security at heart&#151;promoting an expansion of West Bank settlements and an implicit approval of Palestinian expulsion that can only deepen Arab hostility. So we have to look elsewhere to reverse the slide towards another intifada and to revive the peace process; to the United Nations, to the European Union&#151;for many years the largest provider of aids to sustain the Palestinian Authority&#151;and to the Arab League.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000134"></a>It was characteristic of the loss of British influence that the latest European initiative on the Middle East bypassed Britain. Spain, Italy and France, the three Governments who launched it, provide the three  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>largest contingents to the expanded UN force in Lebanon&#151;and they provided them, we should remember, in response to active pressure from Washington. A previous Spanish Government sponsored the Madrid conference of 1991, out of which grew the Oslo peace process; so these are major and legitimate players within the Middle East. I hope that in closing the Minister will assure us that the British are now giving this initiative their full support. He failed to mention it in his opening speech.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000135"></a>The Saudi, Jordanian and Egyptian Governments have also taken the lead in reviving the Arab peace initiative of 2002, which offers Israel the security of peace with its neighbours within a two-state framework. We should welcome the active engagement of these states, and of the Arab League. We need a broad approach, to which as many states as possible are committed. Unilateral actions and bilateral negotiations have run into the sand.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000136"></a>We on these Benches are committed to a secure and prosperous Israel, at peace with its neighbours. Our commitment to Israel rests on our expectation that Israel is a democratic state that respects the highest standards of human rights. Peace for Israel has to rest on a two-state solution that is acceptable to Palestinians. The alternative is endless conflict. I agree with the correspondent in <I>Haaretz</I> who said two weeks ago that the long-term occupation and the settlement strategy risk corrupting Israeli values and society. The seizure of Palestinian land, the demolition of Palestinian houses and the destruction of farmland are not in accord with the values of a Jewish culture that has contributed so much to the development of our civilisation. It is in Israel's vital interests to find a way out of the occupation through a return to multilateral negotiations, which we, and other states, should help.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000137"></a>It is also vital that we preserve democratic values by permitting legitimate criticism by outsiders of the policies of the Israeli Government. The closing down of debate on Middle East policy within the United States through campaigns which attacked centres of Middle Eastern studies in American universities and accused critics of the Israeli Government of anti-Semitism has damaged Israel's enlightened interests. Washington no longer serves as a critical friend offering constructive advice. I was shaken, in a meeting with Shimon Peres in New York four years ago, to hear one speaker refer to</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000270"></a>&#147;the structural anti-Semitism that dominates the British media&#148;,</ul><a name="06120566000256"></a>not to be contradicted by anyone else there, apart from me.

<p><a name="06120566000138"></a>Some neo-conservatives have gone further, suggesting that Europe as a whole is fundamentally anti-Semitic and should therefore be excluded from any voice in the politics of the Middle East peace process. Anti-Semitism is a hateful sentiment which ran under European and American culture until the horror of the Holocaust demonstrated what it might lead to. Criticism of Israeli policy and actions in the occupied territories is of a different order. We should all be careful to maintain the distinction between one and the other and we should all be careful in our

<p><a name="06120566000139"></a>Multilateral diplomacy, backed by financial assistance and the provision, where needed, of peacekeeping forces under UN authority is the only way forward in recreating stability across the Middle East. We on these Benches believe that Britain can best contribute by working as closely as possible now with its European partners to engage the governments of the region. I welcome the emphasis on that in the Minister&#146;s opening speech.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000140"></a>We regret that the dual military commitment to Iraq and Afghanistan will make it impossible, for the foreseeable future, for British Armed Forces to contribute to such peacekeeping operations. For that, we will have to depend on our European partners and other UN states. For both Iraq and Afghanistan, we should now move away from an Anglo-American approach, demanding that others fall in behind us; we need to recognise that such an approach has left us dangerously overexposed as a country and the region dangerously unstable.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000141"></a><b><a name="06120566000364"></a>The Lord Bishop of Winchester:</b> My Lords, in the third day of debate on the gracious Speech, just over a fortnight ago, many Members of your Lordships&#146; House spoke clearly and strongly about the priority of finding a resolution to the disastrously destructive situation in Israel-Palestine&#151;destructive, as has already been said today, not only to both Israelis and Palestinians but to the rest of the Middle East and much wider.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000142"></a>On that day, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was not, in my view, exaggerating&#151;he spoke for many that day and for many who have spoken today&#151;when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000271"></a>&#147;the conflict of Israel and Palestine, with its overspill into Lebanon, holds the key to world peace&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/11/06; col. 209.]</ul><a name="06120566000257"></a>He offered the House and the Government advice that was both sound and innovative. It seemed to me that, in winding up the debate that day, the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, was agreeing with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, had said, as he has done again this afternoon.
<p><a name="06120566000143"></a>I especially remember from a fortnight ago the characteristically distinguished and passionate speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. It was, she said,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000272"></a>&#147;wickedly wrong for Gaza to use rockets against the citizens and civilians of Israel. But it is also wickedly wrong for Gaza to have two people out of three with no running water or to have persistent collective punishment directed against them, with children and elderly people among the many victims&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/11/06; col. 134.]</ul><a name="06120566000144"></a>It is also wickedly wrong for any of us, and for any state, to speak or behave as if the whole situation, not only in Gaza but right across the West Bank and the Occupied Territories, can be allowed to drag on much as it is. This is also true for the Israelis who suffer, too, although not remotely to the extent of the  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Palestinians. The Minister quoted the freshly energetic words of the Prime Minister this afternoon, and it has never been more vital that they should be translated into concerted, persevering diplomatic activity. 
<p><a name="06120566000145"></a>The reality is that the Palestinian economy is in ruins, wrecked by the wanton destruction of olive groves, orchards and factories, by the separation of farmers from their land and of producers from their markets because of the separation wall and fence, by the destruction of homes, and by the constant abusive delays at checkpoints. The quartet&#146;s and the Israelis&#146; freeze on funds to the Palestinian Authority has had a truly terrible and inhumane effect, especially on medical services, on education and on the physical and mental welfare of a generation of children. Tens of thousands of people are now seriously undernourished.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000146"></a>I often wonder whether the Prime Minister, members of his Government and still more the Government of President Bush have taken the time to see the wall and fence from the Palestinian side and through the eyes, accompanied by the commentary, of Palestinians who know and suffer its dire and disproportionate effects. Have they talked to people whose relatives have been held up for hours gratuitously, oppressively and throughout the heat of the day at checkpoints when they were clearly sick or in labour and on the way to hospital, tragically often with the result that their condition has worsened or, indeed, that they have died?</p>

<p><a name="06120566000147"></a>Have the Government questioned the Israeli authorities about the conditions in Bethlehem, the little town about which carols are already being sung and&#151;I hope that noble Lords will be as glad about this as I am&#151;to which the four presidents of Churches Together in England will be going after they have been to Jerusalem in the week before Christmas? Bethlehem today is in effect a prison, entirely surrounded by the separation wall or fence and with a huge and forbidding fortification straddling the road to Jerusalem. The city is imprisoned, too, by the settlements built on its land on the hills around it. The pilgrimage industry is therefore in ruins, and large numbers of Christians have no option but to emigrate. Ever fewer are left in the city of Jesus&#146;s birth.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000148"></a>In particular, have the Government an opinion about the state of affairs around Rachel&#146;s Tomb, sacred to all three faiths and a few hundred yards inside Bethlehem from the point where the wall and that monstrous gate close off the ancient road? In April 1998, a party of pilgrims and I had a good dinner and a valuable opportunity to meet and talk to Palestinian Christians in a Lutheran-owned hotel that overlooks it. A few years later, in the second intifada, the Israeli Defence Forces requisitioned the hotel, concerned for the safety of their then small base behind the sacred site. Two years ago, my wife and I were taken around that same hotel by its Lutheran owners, to whom it had been returned systematically trashed and abused from top to bottom, with highly unpleasant anti-Palestinian slogans on the walls, many of them anti-Muslim, in a Christian-owned building. Now, Rachel&#146;s Tomb is off limits, prohibited to Muslims and to

The great wall of Israel snakes down to enclose both the little shrine and the small Israeli settlement that is being built around it. The Open Bethlehem project fears that, once settlers move in, it will become, like the extremist settlement in Hebron, a provocation to violence in a peaceful place.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000149"></a>We need to be as clear here and across Europe and the United States, and in many Arab states as well, as most Palestinians and many Israelis are clear that the situation is intolerable and that a resolution must be found quickly. Historically, as we have been reminded this afternoon, the UK has such a large share of responsibility for the whole situation that we of all people should be exerting every diplomatic vigour&#151;that good word of the noble Lord, Lord Howell&#151;to bring into existence a widely drawn coalition towards a resolution of all the issues through what will be years of careful, persevering work, which we are frankly late in restarting and about which especially the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, spoke a fortnight ago.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000150"></a>There has to be a two-state solution&#151;one that assures both Israel and the Palestinians security, safety and prosperity. However, I question the realism of the Minister in speaking of returning to the road map, because so many facts on the ground have been brought into being even in the past two years&#151;the continuing development of the illegal occupation, of settlements and of settlers-only roads, tunnels and viaducts, not to speak of the wall or fence.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000151"></a>The weakness of the current Israeli Government cannot be a reason for putting off this fresh diplomatic initiative until what will only be a less promising future still. It will be imperative that all the parties take all the relevant UN resolutions seriously. For my part, I doubt whether peace can be guaranteed for the time that it will take to work through all that must be worked through, including the status of Jerusalem, without a UN force deployed along the internationally recognised borders of Israel. Unless this country and many others work together with those immediately concerned at all those matters as a priority, I am afraid&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;that there is little point in searching for peace anywhere else in the region to which today&#146;s debate is attending or indeed in searching for peace in the cities and transport systems of the northern hemisphere.</p>

I thank the opening speakers for a succession of comprehensive and extraordinarily good speeches.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000153"></a>The two areas of conflict that are the subject of our debate today are very much linked in the minds of many people because British soldiers are regularly risking their lives in an attempt to bring peace, stability and prosperity in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They are linked, too, if we are honest, because of a perception held by many people, although perhaps not as many as some commentators would have us believe, that the conflicts lie at the root of Islamic reaction to western interference. I believe that any

<p><a name="06120566000154"></a>Afghanistan has suffered decades of conflict and turmoil. It is one of the poorest countries anywhere in the world, and because of that poverty even the most basic services such as education and healthcare have long been denied to its people. One in four Afghan children dies before their fifth birthday. More than half the population lives on less than a dollar a day. Between 20 and 40 per cent of Afghans are underfed and undernourished. In these circumstances of abject poverty, where the sustaining of life is a terrible struggle each day, of course people turn to any and every means of feeding their children. Opium remains the most profitable crop for most rural farmers. About 1.7 million people&#151;over 7 per cent of the Afghan population&#151;rely on illegal poppy farming as a way of providing for their families. That fuels insecurity, corruption, indebtedness and fear.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000155"></a>Alternative livelihoods are therefore absolutely vital in order to counter the opium trade, but clearly those alternatives are not created overnight. People who are poor and intimidated by drug dealers do not find it easy to abandon one form of livelihood for another without being certain of success. The Minister has described how the Government have put enormous and growing resources into the endeavour of looking for alternative livelihoods, and his words, of course, are very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000156"></a>But the real issue here is how much finding those livelihoods will be dependent on improved security. That is the real test for NATO. I well remember the discussions when I was a Minister about the levels of commitment from our NATO allies to our joint efforts in Afghanistan. It was, frankly, a disheartening experience listening to some of the contributions of our allies and partners at that time. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us how that has begun to change in terms of support on the ground militarily and support to the Government of Afghanistan on their reforms to its institutions&#151;support, for example, for the civil service and for the key non-governmental organisations.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000157"></a>One of my fiercest concerns is the status of women in Afghanistan. At the time of the Taliban, women were not being educated. Very often they could not get medical help unless they were accompanied by their husbands, which meant, of course, premature death for many widows. Women&#146;s lives were, in effect, completely shut down at that time. So it is good to see, as the Minister has said, that over one-third of children in school are now girls and that 75 per cent of those receiving loans from the micro-finance investment support facility are women. But there are alarming reports that a resurgence of Taliban activity in some parts of Afghanistan has led to an increasingly hostile backlash against these welcome improvements.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000158"></a>When the Minister winds up, I hope that he will be able to tell us how our aid programme is making a lasting impact on the improvements in women&#146;s lives. I hope that he will tell us whether he believes that these changes are as yet sufficiently well established

<p><a name="06120566000159"></a>I turn now to Iraq. When we debated the gracious Speech, our concerns over Iraq were acute, and they remain so. The losses of our troops when such tragedies occur are appalling. So, too, are the almost daily news reports of the most barbaric and disgusting incidents of sectarian violence and murder. I understand that it is now routine for the perpetrators of these murders to be readily identified by the methods of torture that they use before they kill their victims. But the growth of Shia-on-Sunni and Sunni-on-Shia violence, which has been a terrible development over the past 18 months or so, is a fact, and I, for one, do not for a moment believe that anyone can think it will abate without fresh international and internal thinking on policy and operational approach.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000160"></a>Let us not forget that it was only in January that Iraqis in their millions voted for democracy and a new way forward. Many did so in spite of threats against their lives because they believed in the future of their country. But to have a real future, all countries have to have the ability to control their economies and, above all, their own security. The fact is that Iraq has a dual nightmare of internal conflict between two or more different groups, and of the supply of arms and reinforcements from its closest neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000161"></a>In my view, it has been short-sighted of our friends in the United States to have so little contact with Syria and Iran over the past two or three years. Both countries have porous borders with Iraq; both believe that they have good reason of their own to wish to secure an Iraq that is not threatening to them and to widen their sphere of influence within that country. But the two countries are very different. For all the internal disputes in the Arab League, Syria is one of its own. It may be unreliable, and its leaders may be given to outbursts of rhetoric that are inimical to most Arab sensibilities, but most believe that Syria has been wronged and will, given time and patience&#151;and probably a very hard talking to&#151;rejoin the Arab family where it belongs.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000162"></a>The attitude to Iran is more complex. In my experience, Iran is feared and mistrusted by its Arab neighbours. But it commands a degree of respect: it is powerful; it is more populous than any of its Arab neighbours except Egypt; it has a history as long as that of Egypt and a well disciplined army; and it has a very real sense of its own identity. It is a player of real importance in the region, and in respect of Iraq. I hope that the Baker-Hamilton study group will reflect that when it reports tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000163"></a>May I ask the Minister what the Prime Minister, having given his evidence to the study group, will do when the report is published? Will the United Kingdom Government respond? How will the Government&#146;s view be formulated? I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss the study group&#146;s findings in this House&#151;even if we have to do so outside this Chamber. I would very much welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000164"></a>I have left the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until last, but it is still in my view the issue of overarching  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>difficulty and importance in the region. The words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester just now were enormously moving. He asked whether members of Her Majesty&#146;s Government had been to look at the wall or spoken to those directly affected by it. Speaking for myself, I can say that the answer is yes. I did so on several occasions when I was the Minister for the Middle East. At that time&#151;and I am sure it is still the case, as the Minister no doubt will confirm&#151;we protested vigorously about the way in which the wall was routed, as we have made clear over and over again in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000165"></a>Since we discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the debate on the gracious Speech, we have seen not only a ceasefire called by the Palestinians but a speech of real importance from the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert. Of course, we have seen ceasefires before, and the test is often not so much whether individuals or terrorist groups respect the ceasefire but what happens when they do not. Israel has a history of swift and comprehensive retaliation, as we saw all too clearly this summer.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000166"></a>What is remarkable is that, given that both Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas are under huge pressure at home&#151;as has been made very clear this afternoon&#151;this ceasefire is holding. President Abbas is taking on the Palestinian gunmen in what he is saying publicly and Prime Minister Olmert is making it clear that the Government are in charge of the IDF and not the other way round. He is making it clear that rules of engagement must be enforced. He is not in an enviable position, but his speech last week made it absolutely evident that he is determined to adhere to that position. For his part, Abu Mazen has tried in good faith to form a Government with Hamas that would command international support. Maybe if it had been left to Prime Minister Haniya, such a Government might have been formed&#151;but it was not to be. That is another very good reason for our sustaining a frank and robust dialogue with Damascus.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000167"></a>Now both Prime Minister Olmert and President Abu Mazen need solid international support. They are getting it from Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia&#151;and that is very welcome. But unless that support is strong and sustained not only from those countries but from all the countries in the Arab League&#151;and not only now but when the going gets really tough&#151;and unless we in the United Nations, the EU, Russia and the US together with other world players are able to reinforce that support, this may well be another false dawn.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000168"></a>Maybe there is a real opportunity here&#151;and not just an opportunity in the region&#151;because, to be frank, of the recent changes in the US. The departure of Mr Rumsfeld may prompt many reactions, but most reactions on this side of the Atlantic will not be of sorrow. Similarly, Mr Bolton, a very intelligent, enormously hard-working ambassador at the UN, had the terrible drawback of never believing that he could just be wrong. I do not think, given his recent interventions, that many UN delegations will be sorry to see him go.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000169"></a>To make a difference now, we have to grasp the real problem of talking to those who for years have been  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1080"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1080</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>isolated, by the United States and others, in the search for peace in the region. We have to talk not only to the nation states&#151;long established and part of the region&#151;of Syria and Iran, but also to Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups that have engaged in violence but are willing now to talk to us. I know that this is an enormously difficult and sensitive point, but we have to think very clearly about imposing preconditions on whom we speak to and when. We owe it not only to the Palestinians and the Israelis, and not only to the Iraqis, but also to the Lebanese&#151;that brave country with a courageous Prime Minister who expected better of the international community and who had a right to expect better. Lebanon deserves all our support and all our effort now. I look forward to my noble friend&#146;s response about what the Prime Minister&#146;s next steps will be in giving that support and sustaining that effort.</p>
<h5><a name="06120566000286"></a>4.21 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120566000170"></a><b><a name="61205-0004.htm_spnew63"></a><a name="06120566000366"></a>Lord Blaker:</b> My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford that we should be thinking about changing course. I would have preferred this debate to have taken place after the publication of the forthcoming Baker-Hamilton report. Nevertheless, I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss that before long, when we have had time to read it.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000171"></a>All my political life I have firmly supported the alliance between ourselves and the United States, but I am going to make some criticisms of United States policy in the areas we have been considering. I am encouraged to do so because the first thing my American friends ask me about is British public opinion on American policies in the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000172"></a>When he started the Iraq war, President Bush declared that he felt it would bring democracy to the Middle East. That was a pretty ambitious aim, and I think a lot of people were very sceptical about how far it was achievable. When the allied forces first arrived in Iraq, they had a rather lukewarm reception, and the attitude towards us has got worse. We are seen by many in the Middle East as self-interested and particularly interested in oil. The result has been increased hostility to the western powers.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000173"></a>The Prime Minister said recently that terrorism has not been caused by the Iraq war because 9/11 occurred before the Iraq war began. That is not the point; the point is that terrorism is being enormously increased by what is going on now, not what happened on 9/11. If anybody is in any doubt, they need only ask Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of MI5, who talked recently about the effect of what is happening in the Middle East on terrorism. It is obvious that many more men&#151;and women, too&#151;are going in for terrorism. I believe that the terrorist campaign will be with us for many years to come. Historians will regard this war with incredulity.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000174"></a>Another consequence of the war is Iran&#146;s increased influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000175"></a>One of the mistakes made by the Americans was not to prepare properly for the period after the war was over. It was pretty obvious that the war would be  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>brief, and there should have been clear ideas about how we were going to manage affairs in Iraq after it was over.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000176"></a>My noble friend Lord Jopling, whom I am sorry to see is not in his place today, made a powerful speech on 18 March 2003, just before the war began, in which he recounted the impression he had discovered in Washington, where he had just been: no one had thought seriously in any way about what was going to be done to manage the civilian problems after the war. Subsequent events showed that to be absolutely true. Because, to a large extent, of the lack of preparation for how internal affairs in Iraq were going to be managed, the war has released all the latent rivalries between Sunnis and Shias.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000177"></a>I am puzzled by the lack of contact that there must have been between Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the American Government about what was going to be done after the war. I do not know what the preparation was here, but surely it was possible for Her Majesty&#146;s Government to find out from the Americans what was being done about this problem. I am not aware of any contact on that subject. If my noble friend Lord Jopling was able to make contact, surely the Government could have done so.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000178"></a>Another error of the Americans was the decision by Mr Bremer, who was in charge of political affairs in Iraq soon after the end of the war, to abolish the Iraqi army and police force lock, stock and barrel. So they went away, many of them with their weapons, but without pay&#151;a sure recipe for the sort of thing that has been happening most of the time since. Did Her Majesty&#146;s Government know of Mr Bremer&#146;s intentions? Were they consulted about making that extremely unsatisfactory move? Surely that was something we should have been discussing with the Americans. Mr Bremer&#146;s decision explains to a large extent the recent casualties&#151;the fighting, the assassinations, the bombs going off&#151;partly because of the number of weapons in circulation, and partly because of the rivalry between the Shias and the Sunnis.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000179"></a>Another factor that has made the situation worse is the lack of training on the part of the American forces in winning hearts and minds. The dogma of the Pentagon, as was explained to me by an American professor at Princeton, was that they would not go in for hearts and minds; that was for someone else to deal with, not the military forces. That has caused a lot of hostility to the Americans in Iraq. I am glad to see it reported that the American policy I have just referred to is now being reconsidered.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000180"></a>Another mistake that we made was to commit ourselves to the Iraq war at the expense of our ability to pay enough attention to Afghanistan. We thought the Taliban had been safely put on one side, but here it is, reviving in very great strength. That is partly because our forces in Afghanistan are not as strong or numerous as they should have been.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000181"></a>My criticism of the Government in this context is that the Prime Minister failed to manage relations with the United States in the way that he should have done. President Bush badly needed us. We were his best ally. The Prime Minister did not use the influence  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that he had with President Bush, whether we are talking of the time before the war and the United Nations negotiations, or of later events.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000182"></a>The most interesting insight into the attitude of the Prime Minister toward the American president was the accidental broadcasting, after the St Petersburg conference, of a conversation between them in which the Prime Minister said,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000273"></a>&#147;Why don&#146;t you send Condoleezza to Iraq to do something, and I could go and just talk&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61205-0005.htm"/>


<a name="06120566000258"></a>That sheds an interesting light on his attitude. 
<p><a name="06120566000183"></a>Regarding Afghanistan, we were right to take on the Taliban but, after that, we failed by not finishing the job. There has been, and still is, a great overstretch of our forces in Afghanistan. The Taliban is now rich and strong; it looks as if it is going to give us a nasty time for quite a while. I found the statement by the Secretary of State for Defence at the time, John Reid, extraordinary. He said that the forces we were sending to southern Afghanistan might not hear a shot fired in anger. I do not know whether he had failed to read his brief, or whether that was his guesswork&#151;or, more probably, whether it was the considered opinion of our best intelligence&#151;but it was a great mis-statement. Our forces in Afghanistan are performing magnificently and I would say the same of the Canadians, who have taken proportionately more casualties. I must mention an interest in that I was at one time a Canadian soldier.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000184"></a>The third area, which has as much potential for disaster as the first two that I have mentioned, is that of Israel and the Palestinians. That is causing as much terrorism in the world as either of the others, and the longer it goes on the more likely it is to worsen. The quartet seems not to have been very active recently, although it may have been doing things behind the scenes. I would like to see the Americans in particular being much more active in that context; in the last resort only they will be able to solve that problem, as somebody needs to put pressure on Israel. At the back of the problem is the Arab world&#146;s belief that the Americans are favouring Israel.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000185"></a>As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said, conditions in the Palestinian areas in Gaza and the West Bank are absolutely deplorable, as a result of Israeli policies. That is a particular reason for trying to solve that difficult situation as soon as possible. It is doubtful that the policies of Israel will benefit Israel in the long run. I think it is making a big mistake, since the force that it is using to get its will is shocking. It is still building the wall or fence, and thus still breaking international law&#151;as they are elsewhere, by extending the settlements. I hope Israel will realise that, and adopt policies that are to the interest of the whole Middle East, to that of the Palestinians and to that of Israel itself.</p>

Those of the spokespersons of the three main parties were, if possible, even more outstanding than usual. I congratulate the noble Lords, Lord Triesman and  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Howell of Guildford, and my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire on the quality of the reasoning that they bring to these debates. Having said that, no Government have ever had a better wicketkeeper than the noble Lord, Lord Triesman. The test side playing in Australia would be very grateful to have his help. I am not altogether sure that his Government deserve him, but I shall not further qualify the compliment I pay him.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000187"></a>I begin by picking up an important point that the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, made about Iraq. He said that little planning had been done on what was to happen after the victory. That is undoubtedly clear. However, it is rather worse than that. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, gallantly gave the best possible impression that he could of what is happening in Iraq. But what he understandably did not mention, for reasons of time, was the relative disaster that reconstruction has been in that country. Something like 80 per cent of the inhabitants of Iraq are unemployed. All of us in this House know very well that unemployment feeds young men and women into being only too ready to take up the cause of terrorism or anything else because they have no means of making a decent living. The noble Lord was kind enough not to mention the $18.8 billion which are believed to have been lost from reconstruction funds as a result of poor administration by the United States occupation authorities and western companies&#146; ludicrously high overheads. Those companies seized most of the work, such as smaller construction projects, that should have gone to the Iraqis.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000188"></a>At present the citizens of Iraq are not only continually jeopardised and stressed by the level of insecurity and violence in that country, but still have only begun to get back the electricity, gas, water supplies and sewerage treatment that they might have expected to have 20 years ago. It is a very sad situation. I strongly recommend that anybody who finds me partisan looks at the website of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, a position included in the Iraqi Appropriations Act by a handful of Congressmen, led by Henry Waxman of California. The website presents a candid, honest and extraordinarily disturbing account of the reconstruction in Iraq and the ways in which so much of the money that all of us, but notably the United States, have contributed, has been abused, misused and allowed to run into the ground.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000189"></a>A further point, which I believe to be very important, concerns the desperate efforts to try to hand over to the Iraqi army and police. That is the way we need to go, but we are still not putting enough money into training those young men and we still fail to protect them. One of the sadnesses in Iraq is that, day after day, young male and female police recruits are slaughtered almost before they start their duties. Many noble Lords will speak about Iraq in this debate. It would be helpful if, at some stage, our ever ebullient Prime Minister were willing to recognise that the invasion of Iraq was a very serious mistake indeed in British foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000190"></a>I pay tribute to the excellent speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, who spoke movingly about Afghanistan. Her comments were very  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relevant to the situation. She spoke with great honesty about some of the problems Afghanistan faces. I will come to those in a moment, but I want to raise one other issue, which is a matter of great concern to NATO and which noble Lords with great knowledge of the alliance, such as my noble friend Lord Garden, might say something about. The Minister might also say something about it.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000191"></a>We know that the time of General Richards in Afghanistan has been applauded by all sides. Here is a military leader who has captured the imagination of many of his colleagues&#151;Afghan, American and other allies alike; who is almost universally praised for the way in which he has handled the operation; who has gone out of his way to bring the battle for hearts and minds alongside the battle for military advantage; and who, after just nine months of outstanding success in Afghanistan, is to be switched to another post. Surely NATO could take these matters rather more seriously. Nobody, however brilliant, could grasp the complexities of Afghanistan in just nine months. No sooner has General Richards gained a powerful leadership position in that country&#151;one we all applaud for bringing the political and military campaigns together&#151;than he is suddenly moved somewhere else, to be replaced by an American general, who was last seen in Afghanistan at the height of the period of occupation by troops three years ago. That is a great pity. I wonder why people could not be retained on the grounds of their outstanding performance, rather than switched around simply because of some bureaucratic decision made by a NATO which finds it very difficult to work like an alliance, and in which each member state still has to get sovereign permission before accepting even very straightforward operational requests from the generals, because of the way it is constructed.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000192"></a>On Afghanistan, I want to follow what the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, said about the terrifying dependence on the poppy crop as a means of keeping very poor Afghans alive. Some 2 million people are totally dependent on it. The astonishing figures suggest that this is an area where we are losing hand over fist. In 2001&#151;a time, I regret to say, when the Taliban was very powerful&#151;7,606 hectares, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, were devoted to the growing and cultivation of the opium poppy. This year 165,000 hectares are devoted to the opium poppy&#151;the highest level ever in Afghan history. It is astonishing that, despite terribly expensive efforts to destroy the poppy crop, which last year cost the United States alone $235 million, we are seeing&#151;because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, rightly said, there are no alternatives&#151;it grow and grow. Most of the product comes to the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000193"></a>We have to be more imaginative. One of the suggestions made by an NGO, which may not be practical, was to buy a large part of the poppy crop to make legitimate drugs, of the kind still badly needed, such as morphine and other painkillers. I understand the difficulty of doing that when the Afghan Government is highly corrupt. If we cannot do that, surely we could at least consider creating a kind of common agricultural policy for the other crops. If we  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to pay too much for them for the next four of five years, it would still be far less expensive than what we are presently trying to do, and would enable Afghan farmers to lead decent and legitimate lives without being driven into what is increasingly a criminal economy in a large part of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000194"></a>I agree completely with the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, on the position of girls and women in Afghanistan. She is obviously right to say that we must defeat the Taliban, but we cannot do it by military means alone. We have to find economic reasons for Afghans to believe that supporting the Taliban is not in their interests, let alone in the interests of the world.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000195"></a>I turn to two other issues&#151;I am well aware of the pressure of time. The first, again, follows something that was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons&#151;that is, the state of Lebanon. I say again as strongly as I can that I believe that our Prime Minister and President Bush made a desperate mistake in not insisting on a ceasefire in Lebanon at the beginning of the Israeli offensive on southern Lebanon. Why did we imagine for a moment that this weak but democratic, western-inclined state would be able to live with the consequences of so many civilians being killed and so many babies, who, as our televisions showed, were alive and then died, being carried out of burning buildings? That is no way to create support for a moderate Government in a country where hearts and minds are crucial. We have now put at risk the Lebanese Government, led by a decent, moderate and thoughtful man, President Siniora, whom the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, and I have met and been impressed by. What did we think we were doing? As a result, not only have Iran and Hezbollah been strengthened but the Government of Lebanon may not survive for more than the next few hours because of the level of demonstrations in the street. Talk about shooting oneself in the foot! This is to shoot oneself in the heart, and it is an absurd thing to have done. I only hope and pray that Lebanon&#146;s Government survive to take part in a wider regional peace process. But, frankly, the odds are against it at present and very much in favour of a Government whom we would not like to succeed this decent one, led by a decent man, who supported western ideals and western values.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000196"></a>Lastly, I want to say a word about Israel and Palestine. It is worth remembering that it was King Abdullah of Jordan who said:</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000264"></a>&#147;I know people will say that there are several core problems in the Middle East ... But for the majority of us living in this part of the world, it has always been the Israeli-Palestinian, the Israeli-Arab problem&#148;,</ul><a name="06120566000259"></a>at the centre. That has been true for 40 years: it always comes back to the Israeli-Arab, Israeli-Palestinian relationship. 
<p><a name="06120566000197"></a>Again, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, about the extreme interest and concern that we should feel for the brave initiative of Ehud Olmert, the Prime Minister of Israel. He said only a few days ago&#151;at the end of November&#151;that he was in favour of making a major initiative towards the Palestinians, admittedly at a time when the Palestinian state is  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1086"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1086</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>worse even than it has been over recent years because of the desperate plight of Gaza, to which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester&#151;I apologise to him for having missed the earliest part of his speech&#151;made such moving reference. We should stop for a moment and consider how important that initiative is.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000198"></a>There is reason to believe that Mr Olmert has long been in favour of trying to reach a decent peace with Palestine. However, there are two great worries. The first was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate and others, including my noble friend Lord Wallace. It is what appears to be the double standard that western countries apply to Israel and the Palestinians. They are absolutely right to say that the Palestinians, in the shape of Hezbollah, should recognise Israel and abandon threats to destroy it, but alongside that equally goes the absolute necessity for Israel to recognise that the war and the settlements are contrary to international law. An even-handed Government, which I should like to see ours become, would make that clear at the same time to both those Governments in order to create the possibility of peace.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000199"></a>I have one other great fear, which I shall mention in this final minute. I do not know how many noble Lords saw the very troubling article that appeared in <I>Ha&#146;aretz</I> on 3 December. In it, a very brave journalist, Gideon Levy, refers to the fact that, time and again, when peace has been very close between Israel and the Palestinians, when there was a referendum on the prisoner proposals, and when Hamas and the Palestinian Authority came together to create a united Government, a very high-level Palestinian figure has been assassinated and, shortly afterwards, the terrorism has begun all over again. So we now need to couple with our requests and demands to Israel and the Palestinians to pave the way for a peace that might be lasting&#151;and, God knows, that too hangs on a thread&#151;a request for an end to judicial assassinations, because they are completely contrary to the ability to run politics in a civilised manner and, in the end, will destroy those who are responsible for them.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000200"></a><b><a name="61205-0005.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="06120566000368"></a>Lord Wright of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Government for giving the House a long overdue opportunity for a debate exclusively devoted to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Many of your Lordships will no doubt have decided to concentrate on the dangerous and critical situation in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon and on our relations with Syria and Iran. It will not surprise many noble Lords if, like the right reverend Prelate, I choose to concentrate on the situation and prospects for relations between Israel and the Palestinians, not only because the gracious Speech rightly accorded this long-standing problem high priority in the Government&#146;s foreign policy agenda, but also because I believe that we are at a critical and important moment when there are or should be real prospects for progress towards a lasting and fair peace settlement.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000201"></a>It is arguable that the simultaneous crises in Iraq, Gaza and Lebanon now present opportunities as well as challenges. There are signs that not only moderate  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1087"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1087</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Arab states, such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but also Israel and even Syria are looking afresh at ways to ease the interconnected tensions in both Palestine and Iraq. Many of us in this House have argued, as I do again today, that a fair and balanced approach to the Palestinian problem is a central and essential pillar, not only for the many problems that threaten our interests in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East, but also for our relationships with the wider Muslim world and within our own domestic communities.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000202"></a>I hope that when the Prime Minister meets President Bush in Washington this week he will not allow the very timely discussions that they will no doubt have on future policy on Iraq to divert them from the urgent need to address the critical situation in Israel and Palestine&#151;the &#147;regional context&#148; of Iraq's problems, as an editorial in yesterday's <I>Financial Times </I>put it. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians have suffered enough. Surely it is time for the quartet to revive and intensify its efforts to return to the road map, even if the route is changing. Continuing violence by both sides across the borders of Gaza has too easily diverted attention from the wider suffering and deprivation of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem and, of course, Bethlehem. That includes their continuing economic hardship; their lack of access to education, employment and health treatment, caused by restrictions on movement and border crossings; the intrusive construction of the so-called security fence, which has divided Palestinian families and blocked access to their olive groves and orchards; and the continuing expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank and around Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000203"></a>I do not want to focus solely on the dreadful suffering and bitter resentment caused by continuing Israeli occupation and annexation of Palestinian land. It is encouraging that voices can now increasingly be heard from private individuals on both sides calling for a peaceful settlement and the end of occupation.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000204"></a>Three positive developments in the past few weeks are worth noting. First, there was the unilateral announcement of a ceasefire in Gaza by Hamas and the consequent call by the Israeli Prime Minister for restraint on the part of the Israeli Defence Forces. Secondly, there was an important and potentially historic speech by Ehud Olmert on 27 November, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, referred, in which he not only made a conditional promise to release numerous Palestinian prisoners, but committed himself to implement the road map by working for an independent and contiguous Palestinian state. Thirdly, Prime Minister Olmert called for the assistance of neighbouring Arab states, including Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, to achieve a fair and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians&#151;a call that seems, to those of us who had the privilege of hearing King Abdullah of Jordan speaking in the Robing Room a month ago, likely to receive a positive response. Indeed, all of us who heard King Abdullah on that occasion will have been impressed by his warning that time for a peaceful settlement is fast running out.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1088"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1088</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000205"></a>No doubt there will be further violence and difficulties to frustrate these good intentions, not least the problems that Mahmoud Abbas is facing in trying to form a national unity Government. I believe that this is a moment when our Prime Minster has perhaps his last opportunity to use such influence as he has, or should have, with President Bush to persuade the Americans to grasp the nettle of a fair and peaceful solution to the Arab-Israel dispute by adopting and maintaining a balanced&#151;I keep repeating that word&#151;just and proactive policy towards both sides.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000206"></a>Of course, there is an urgent need to relieve the economic deprivation in both Gaza and the West Bank, and I acknowledge the outstanding and generous contribution that we and our colleagues in the European Union have made towards that end. But aid is not everything. It is all the more urgent to revive the road map, to maintain and encourage a dialogue with all the parties, including Hamas, and to use our own historical connections and our diplomatic skills in the Middle East to assist the parties to fulfil their ambitions for a just and lasting peace settlement. This will require courage and concessions from all the parties. They will need firm and consistent support and encouragement, not least from the United States superpower, if we are to achieve an outcome that would be of major importance for the interests not only of Palestinians and Israelis, but of peace and stability in the wider Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000207"></a>I find it deeply disappointing that President Bush, on his recent visit to Jordan, apparently made no attempt, as he could easily have done, to invite either Palestinians or Israelis to meet him, to show at least that he regards a Palestinian peace settlement as central to his policies in the Middle East. Mr Blair has this week a unique opportunity to persuade Mr Bush of the vital necessity of United States commitment or recommitment to the road map. I hope that he will take it.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000208"></a>Much has been said and written about the loss of influence in the Middle East that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have suffered because of our involvement in the tragedy of Iraq and because of our implicit failure, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, referred, to support a rapid ceasefire in Lebanon. I firmly believe&#151;but then I would, wouldn&#146;t I?&#151;that our Diplomatic Service has unique strengths and experience in the Middle East and elsewhere to enable us to play an influential and vigorous role with all our friends and allies in working for the peace settlement that has eluded us for nearly 60 years.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000209"></a>There are conflicting reports, nearly all depressing, on the effect that the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review is likely to have on the resources available to the Diplomatic Service&#151;a service, I remind your Lordships, with one of the smallest budgets in Whitehall&#151;to maintain adequate representation in our embassies and high commissions worldwide. Many of us have expressed our regret that the Diplomatic Service has already been forced to close several diplomatic posts. I hope that the Minister when he winds up the debate can give us an assurance that sufficient resources will be made available to enable our diplomats to continue not only to represent our interests in the Middle East, but to have the wherewithal to pursue a genuinely global foreign policy.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1089"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1089</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06120566000289"></a>5 pm</h5>

Our domestic security necessitates marginalising extremism by winning hearts and minds. However, a significant number of hearts and minds are not being won in some quarters by the perception of what is happening, or failing to happen, in the Gulf, the Middle East and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000211"></a>Nothing can justify the vicious and sinister terrorism, but in the grim reality of Iraq there are lessons to be learnt, and which must be seen to be learnt, if we are to have credibility in the global role we seek to play.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000212"></a>First, trust is essential, and it was extensively damaged when the reason given for intervention and its timing proved false.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000213"></a>Secondly, the absence of a specific, convincing Security Council resolution did not just mean that some ritualistic formula had been neglected, or even just that international law had been flouted. Its absence meant that a sufficient global consensus for what was being undertaken had not been achieved, and that as adverse consequences predictably accumulated, dangerous polarisation inevitably grew, accentuating hostility towards those primarily involved, not least the United States and us.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000214"></a>Thirdly, it was inexcusable to launch such major action without having thought through and planned for all the potential consequences. Building peace matters every bit as much as winning wars. Official refusal to acknowledge the number of civilian casualties and fatalities during the intervention was provocative, wrong, insensitive and highly counter-productive. The brutalities which followed by some of the security and armed services compounded this.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000215"></a>Fourthly, plans for a constitutional and political settlement have to be owned by a widespread and representative cross-section of those for whom it is being made. Durable democracy, justice and stability have to be carefully built from the foundations upwards; they cannot simply be orchestrated and coerced by outsiders. Of course the outside world can assist, and reliable and inclusive regional guarantees, arguably involving both Syria and Iran, could be a vital part of this, but a lasting solution cannot be imposed by outsiders.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000216"></a>To say all this is in no way to condone or deny the barbaric cruelty of the previous regime in Iraq. However, what is sad is that the tragic consequences of the intervention and the way it has been conducted may have become even more globally destabilising than was that regime with all its sick manifestations.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000217"></a>In the morass, as it now is, nothing matters more than to endeavour to find a constitutional and political way forward that meets the situation as it is, rather than as we would like it to be. We cannot just walk away; that would be cynical and irresponsible. We have to face up to the consequences of our actions, but the way in which we do that must relate to what is really a viable way forward, however radically different this may prove to be from what we hoped would happen.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000218"></a>In the Middle East, justice remains an indispensable element for success. Historically, the United Kingdom carries a special responsibility to the people of Israel. Our forebears were among those who played a lead role in the creation of that nation, but we must never forget that no people paid a higher price for the creation of Israel than the Palestinians. Maximum possible justice for them must therefore always be, and be seen to be, a priority. We all welcome the ceasefire. Now the Government of Israel must be encouraged to understand that finding a viable way forward will necessitate talking with people with whom it is not easy to talk, as we ourselves discovered in Northern Ireland. It is a flawed and counter-productive approach to talk only to those with whom it is easy to talk. The objective is surely to marginalise irreconcilable extremism. Bridges must be built with those in Hamas and Hezbollah who can be won to a political process. Once more, our experience in Northern Ireland is relevant. As with Iraq, the outside world can assist&#151;as can regional neighbours, not least Syria if it is seriously so minded&#151;but it cannot impose a lasting solution.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000219"></a>Meanwhile, the destabilising humanitarian plight of the Palestinians must be addressed. The suspension of international aid to the Palestinian Authority&#151;$350 million of direct budgeting support in 2005&#151;and the withholding of tax revenues by Israel, which totalled $814 million in 2005, have led to a dramatic increase in poverty. The World Bank has estimated that poverty increased to 44 per cent in 2005 and is expected to rise to 67 per cent in 2006. There has been a drastic contraction in public services, with essential medicines in short supply, public hospitals stopping all but emergency treatment and dialysis, and health NGOs facing collapse with the curtailment of Ministry funding.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000220"></a>The temporary international mechanism has not halted the decline. While it may be true that 60,000 public sector workers have received partial payments under the TIM, it is estimated that as many as 90,000 workers have been excluded from the scheme, mostly security personnel. The World Bank believes that public sector incomes have dropped by 60 per cent. Meanwhile, refuse collection and sanitation are at breaking point. Cesspits are overflowing, and refuse is piling up in the streets. The TIM provides its funding through the Fatah office of the president, but the danger is that such parallel funding structures undermine existing Ministries and complicate nation-building and stability.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000221"></a>It has been disturbing to hear of the upsurge in fighting in the south of Afghanistan, linked as it is to a revival of the Taliban and the determination by the Afghan Government and the NATO ISAF to establish government authority there. It is especially disturbing that the Taliban infiltration seems to be occurring in new areas in the west and centre&#151;for example, Farah and Wardak&#151;threatening to spread to areas of the north with Pashtun populations, and is now close to Kabul itself. There are reports that shadow government structures are being set up in parts of northern Helmand, with sporadic attempts at control in other areas. At the same time it seems that, in non-Taliban areas, local commanders with well

<p><a name="06120566000222"></a>Like others, I am concerned by the failure of some NATO members to live up to what had been expected of them in Afghanistan. It must raise questions about the future of NATO. Indeed, I wonder whether it does not throw new light on the importance of military co-operation within the European Union. Dependability is critical in military planning and operations. That demands closer political integration, it seems to me.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000223"></a>It has become clear that the unanticipated strength of the military opposition in Afghanistan has undermined the intended two-pronged strategy of military toughness and humanitarian effectiveness. Does my noble friend not agree that it remains true that the use of military power alone will never resolve the current problems in Afghanistan? Is it not essential to give equal emphasis to increasing the capacity of Afghan institutions to manage security, improve governance, and both lead and deliver on reconstruction and development? Poverty should surely be recognised as one of the key causes of the current instability. Afghanistan, after all, is ranked 173rd out of 178 countries on the human development index.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000224"></a>Does my noble friend also agree that more donor attention and resources must therefore be directed towards those areas where they can make a tangible difference to the security problem over a longer time frame; for example, health and education, employment programmes, justice sector capacity-building, and police and army reforms? In a report published on 27 November, Oxfam&#151;I declare an interest as a former director&#151;highlighted that half the children in Afghanistan still did not go to school, despite a 500 per cent increase in enrolment in the past six years. With the advent of democracy, the main symbol of national regeneration lay in the dream of educating every child&#151;boy and girl. However, there remain many obstacles to achieving that. Demand for education has to be bolstered, as does the confidence to stay in the education system.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000225"></a>The Oxfam report underlines that extra investment in school buildings is desperately required. Over half of pupils do not go to school because there is no school nearby; over half of the schools need major repairs; the majority are without clean drinking water or toilet facilities, while 2 million children study in tents or in the open air. Against that background, Oxfam has called on the international community to invest $563 million to rebuild 7,800 schools across the country.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000226"></a>In Afghanistan there may be up to 10 million small arms circulating in a country with a population of just 23 million. Guns have arrived in three waves since conflict began in 1979. Up to 2 million people are thought to have died since then, and hundreds more are disabled by their injuries. The guns come from all over the world, including the US, the UK, France, India and Pakistan. While some disarmament has taken place, many leaders of armed groups still possess weapons and use them to abuse and threaten people and to steal property. As in so many other

Surveys suggest that nearly two-thirds of Afghans now believe that disarmament is the most important way to improve security.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000227"></a>There is no simple solution. Ex-combatants must be disarmed, demobilised and reintegrated into their communities. UN programmes, albeit with mixed results, have attempted to achieve that. Alternative sources of livelihood must be provided so that the gun is not the only means of survival. Foreign Governments should remember their part in arming Afghan warring sides in the past and therefore recognise their heavy responsibility to ensure that arms supplies do not fall into the wrong hands. The world really must take responsibility for the arms it supplies. To do that, the proposed new international arms trade treaty should be urgently agreed.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000228"></a>I must congratulate our Government on their strong leadership on this. The United Kingdom was commendably active at the UN General Assembly in October. As consultation goes forward in 2007 and the group of governmental experts is convened, the Government will have to keep up the pressure on the United States&#151;the only country to block the vote for an ATT in New York&#151;and on the other countries which, by their abstention, could become obstacles to the achievement of a legally binding arms trade treaty. I understand that there will be a further relevant vote on these matters in the UN General Assembly this week.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000229"></a>I am among those who fervently want to see the United Kingdom play a lead role in international security. The issues we have debated today illustrate what a complex challenge that is. We cannot police the world on our own. What is required is a strong commitment to the United Nations, to effective international and regional arrangements for military and police co-operation, and to making a success of the international rule of law, so badly set back by the kind of intervention that took place in Iraq. This means that we must critically examine our current and future defence expenditure to ensure that we give substance to this global commitment. It is highly questionable whether it remains appropriate to renew colossally expensive, and arguably distorting, unilateral postures of the past. Prioritisation is essential. We must will the relevant and effective means as well as the ends. All this also means never bringing about a faltering in the brave endeavour by putting our courageous men and women of the armed services at risk of failure by expecting them to be in too many places at once or by sending them into operations ill equipped.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000231"></a>Unfortunately, many of the decisions are taken and much of the policy-making is done in No. 10 Downing Street. Despite what <I>Active Diplomacy</I> describes, accurately, as the language and negotiating skills of the Foreign Office, the Prime Minister sent the head of his own Strategy Unit&#151;a serving diplomat but, I think a specialist on Europe&#151;to negotiate with Syria, just as he sent the noble Lord, Lord Levy, as his personal negotiator to the Middle East and Latin America. The head of the Foreign Policy Centre that he created was &#147;horrified to discover&#148; that our foreign policy was based on the UK's national interest and has only recently taken the view that we do not need arms or defence because,</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000274"></a>&#147;our influence comes from the fact that everyone respects us&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06120566000232"></a>Much valuable knowledge in the FCO of the probable consequences of trying not just to get rid of Saddam but to fit the Shia and the Sunni into the same tidy Procrustean democratic bed in Iraq has been ignored. Our Armed Forces are now paying for that. Equally, negotiating with Syria, Iran&#151;and, perhaps, in the context of the future of the Kurds, Turkey&#151;will require deep knowledge of the history of the region and not simply negotiating skills. It is not too late to draw on that knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000233"></a>The same is true of Afghanistan, which is a harsh land and, history tells us&#151;although the Government do not seem to read much history&#151;is by tradition both warlike and fiercely Islamic. It is wholly unlikely to change its traditional attitude to women&#151;I wish that I could think otherwise&#151;or to abandon tribal structures for democracy. Do we really think that the Army is there to hold the ring to allow a Western civilisation to emerge, with the help of DfID, at some unlikely future date? This country cannot afford to lose highly trained soldiers on what is likely to be a long, long war of attrition in which there may be no decisive victories. The military mission in Afghanistan needs to be redefined.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000234"></a>We are committed, under the defence planning assumptions, to one enduring medium-scale military deployment, one enduring small-scale operation and one non-enduring small-scale operation. The strategic review considered that we should never do two major operations at once, but that is exactly what we are doing. We are failing to use our resources properly and to give our overstretched forces the support that they need. Both the National Audit Office, in its report on 3 November on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces, and the 35th report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body are ringing alarm bells. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that those warnings, including the fact that the commitments routinely exceed current manning, are being heeded not in some distant future but now.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000235"></a>According to the National Audit Office, four major reasons are given in a list of 28 for military personnel to think of leaving the service. One is the impact of service life on family life: 64 per cent, overall. Another  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1094"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1094</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is quality of equipment: 49 per cent. Another is uncertainty over the future, given current changes in the forces: 54 per cent. Most disturbing of all is the</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000275"></a>&#147;feeling that the work of the Services is no longer valued&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06120566000260"></a>55 per cent. Those are issues of both morale and efficiency and it is essential that they be addressed for reasons of both recruitment and retention.
<p><a name="06120566000236"></a>One problem which concerns both the NAO and the Armed Forces Pay Review Body is defence medicine and the need of the wounded soldier to be treated in a military environment. The NAO reviews a number of pinch-point trades&#151;the trades where there is real trouble and not enough people. Case studies 10&#151;&#147;General Practitioners, Tri-Service&#148;&#151;and 11&#151;&#147;Accidents and Emergency and Intensive Therapy Unit Nurses, Tri-Service&#148;&#151;are relevant and disturbing. The NAO expects that GPs will remain on the operational pinch-point register at least until 2010, and points out that 50 per cent of medics in field hospitals in Operation TELIC in Iraq have been provided by the Territorial Army and that medical support personnel have also been provided by some coalition partners and even some contractors to meet some of the forces&#146; commitments. There is much to be done to remedy this serious pinch point, although, despite everything, the Territorial Army has done a brilliant job.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000237"></a>I believe there are four or five dedicated wards in the country, usually with a ratio of 70:30 of military to civilian nursing staff. In how many of those are service wounded&#151;I do not expect the unfortunate Minister to answer this&#151;surrounded by confused geriatrics because of the policy of giving the NHS first call on all beds? The average number of patients in one week has gone from 40 to 80. There are not enough trained military personnel to train others; there is, in particular, a severe shortage of nurses trained in intensive care and emergencies, whether to serve abroad or at home. How many guides on deployment are being breached? The Tory Government&#146;s closure of all military hospitals under Treasury pressure was the fatal first step for defence medicine, but this Government&#146;s policy of so-called dedicated wards has done little to meet the needs of our service men and women through three wars&#151;the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000238"></a>Finally, the effect of the troops&#146; prevailing belief, as reported by the NAO, that their work is no longer valued, is a vital morale issue. The effect on both retention and recruitment can only be serious at a time when we are committed indefinitely to two major operations. Her Majesty&#146;s Government need to recognise that this is a significant and dangerous situation in which the Armed Forces need immediate and visible commitment to defence from the Government, rather than an announcement from the Chancellor, while visiting troops, of more aid for Iraq and an announcement from the Prime Minister of the doubling of aid for Pakistan and an offer of large funds to pay for so-called faith schools. So long as Her Majesty&#146;s Government choose to commit the Armed Forces to major ventures, they have a duty to ensure that they get the resources they need, time for training, proper roulement, essential armaments and medical services, and due care for families.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120566000239"></a>The Armed Forces Pay Review Body has also produced a full report on service medical and dental officers&#151;a supplement to its 35th report&#151;which reports a shortfall in medical officers of 21 per cent by July 2005, with undermanning in critical consultant specialties of 40 to 60 per cent. By July 2005&#151;over a year ago&#151;the TA strength of medical officers was only 310 out of a requirement of 680. Forty-eight per cent plan to leave the service within five years.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000240"></a>Both recruitment and retention are seriously and adversely affected by the disparity between the pay of NHS doctors and nurses and that of those in the services. The Government must not, as they did with service housing, require the MoD to find the necessary money at the expense of other, very often urgent, operational needs. This is what has happened year after year when it comes to keeping long-standing promises to provide decent housing for families. Each year, the MoD has to say, &#147;Sorry; something more urgent has cropped up&#148;. The Government must provide new money, and urgently, both for retention and for recruitment. No one knows, for instance, how long the commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan will last and what their nature will be. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body estimates that its recommendations both on retaining those in place and on recruitment will add &#163;9.9 million to the Director General Army Medical Services pay bill. This is not too much to commit to the urgent needs of the services, and it should be ring-fenced. Let us at least use the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan to ensure that our Armed Forces can survive and do their job as they should be expected to do.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000241"></a>I should add that I warmly support what the noble Baronesses, Lady Williams of Crosby and Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, have said about the possibility of buying the poppy crop. I feel very strongly that to do so for medical purposes would be a solution and would save lives. It would also, to some extent, break the power of the Taliban, as part of its power over the people is its position as brokers for the poppy trade. I hope that that will be taken into consideration. It seems remarkably sensible and simple.</p>

I was one of those who supported the invasion of Iraq. Apparently, there are not too many around these days who did. I supported it really if only to get rid of Saddam Hussein, a dictator who invaded two countries, gassed his own people, and inflicted many cruelties on the Shia people, who were the majority of the population. He was a minor Hitler, but with greater ambitions yet unseen and unfulfilled. The world will be a better place without him.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000243"></a>Now we find ourselves in the situation that we are unable to control and unable to influence. That does not invalidate the reasons for the war. We are trying to persuade ourselves and our allies that there is no civil war, yet the reality is otherwise. The minority Sunni, having lost the power they had for the past 20 years, are seeking to return the previous regime to its original power by making devastating attacks on the Shia population. The Shia, having suffered from  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1096"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1096</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Saddam&#146;s Sunni regime, are now seeking revenge on the Sunni for their past suffering. They have now perpetrated the most heinous crimes against each other by destroying places of worship and murdering thousands of innocent people.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000244"></a>The allies, who are struggling to keep the peace, are no longer the main targets. We are caught in the crossfire. We should stop pretending that we can control or influence the situation. It is apparent that our presence no longer serves a useful purpose since we are unable to stop the war between the Sunni and Shia. If the allies can accept the reality they are left with no alternative but to agree with the Iraqi Government that now a timetable for withdrawal must be discussed and agreed.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000245"></a>I turn to the situation between Israel, Palestine and Lebanon. Although I am a strong supporter of Israel, I have criticised Israel for remaining in occupation of Palestine for more than 38 years, which is more than six times longer than we occupied Germany after the Second World War. The former Israeli Prime Minister Sharon decided in 2005 to withdraw from Gaza and the withdrawal was subsequently carried out. This is the second time that Israel has made an honourable and strategic withdrawal. The first time was in 2000 when it withdraw from Lebanon with the enthusiastic support of the Israeli people. That did not prevent Hizbollah from regularly attacking Israeli civilians after the army withdrew. Hizbollah has launched 106 attacks on Israeli citizens since 2000 without any significant reply from Israel. Those attacks included 42 anti-tank missile attacks, 28 Katyusha rocket attacks, 16 infiltration attempts and nine shooting attacks. One must wonder why Israel waited so long before deciding that enough was enough.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000246"></a>As your Lordships will see, when Israel follows the urging of many nations to withdraw from territories that it is occupying, it is not met with restraint by those who are left there to live in peace. Hizbollah does not represent the Government of the Lebanese people and the area of southern Lebanon that Hizbollah occupies has been a no-go area for the Lebanese army, which is utterly unable to control it. The 106 attacks to which I referred, together with the taking of Israeli soldiers as hostage, led Israel to consider the attack on Lebanon. I believe that the Israeli Government should have issued an ultimatum to return the soldiers and cease further attacks on Israel. If Hizbollah had complied then, there would be no war. If it failed to comply, the world at least would have seen that Israel had a just cause and in the eyes of the world it would have demonstrated a possible peaceful resolution to the war before its attack on Hizbollah and the Lebanese people.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000247"></a>The withdrawal of the Israeli troops from Gaza presented the Palestinians with a unique opportunity to revive the economy of Gaza, and to give employment to half a million unemployed Palestinians, who are now without work, for them to be responsible for the consequences of their own actions, whatever they may be. The western world has promised the Palestinians &#163;3 billion for the reconstruction of their country when peace is restored. When Israel left Gaza, this would have been  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1097"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1097</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an appropriate moment to have provided, say, &#163;1 billion towards the country&#146;s reconstruction. Sadly, as was said about Arafat, the Palestinians never fail to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. When Israel completed its withdrawal from Gaza, the majority of Israelis were overjoyed. Within a few weeks after withdrawal, the Israeli feelings turned from joy to bitterness when Hamas or Islamic Jihad began to fire rockets at bordering Israeli towns.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000248"></a>The consequences of this are not only bad for the people of Gaza but also for the Palestinians living on the West Bank. Many Israelis began to argue that Israel was safer when Gaza was occupied. Now there is very little enthusiasm in Israel to support the grand plan presented by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to withdraw from most of the remaining territories in the West Bank. It may be that the Israeli fear is justified because of Palestinian acts of aggression since the withdrawal from Gaza. It leads me to wonder whether the Palestinian people can really see the long-term negative consequences of their most recent aggression on the quality of life that they wish for but obviously cannot create.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000249"></a>During the Lebanon war, a Lebanese family said:</p>
<ul><a name="06120566000265"></a>&#147;We are not fighters, we&#146;re families who only want peace&#148;.</ul><a name="06120566000261"></a>That certainly applies to all Lebanese and Palestinians, except those working for the destruction of Israel. It equally applies to virtually all Israelis who want only to live in peace within secure borders. I believe that if a referendum was held in all three countries on whether they wanted to live in total peace with their neighbours would probably secure 90 per cent support. The problem lies with the relatively few who continue to seek the destruction of Israel. 
<p><a name="06120566000250"></a>When Hamas recognises the immediate needs of its own people and sets forth to develop a plan for future economic growth, educational development and the creation of jobs for its people, it will find, right next door, a strong and purposeful neighbour and collaborator in the Israeli people. But, as we have known from 2,000 years of history, this change of perception is not easily achieved.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000251"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, who is no longer in his place, made a number of quite significant criticisms of Israel&#151;and, frankly, I agree with most of them&#151;but there are always two sides to every coin and sometimes it is difficult to see both sides at the same time. He referred, in particular, to the wall. Although about 90 per cent of the wall is a fence, nevertheless it is still a restriction. The wall itself is fairly devastating when you are close up to it and the right reverend Prelate&#146;s criticisms of it were valid. However, he did not mention why on Earth Israel would spend millions and millions of shekels to create the wall if it had no purpose. The fact that the purpose of the wall has not been mentioned today is perhaps proof that it has worked: it is to deal with suicide attacks.</p>

<p><a name="06120566000252"></a>It is the duty of every Government, beyond anything else, to defend its own people. If we had rockets coming from France into Britain, I do not how long it would take us to try to occupy maybe

Israel was unable to counteract suicide bombers and decided upon a plan to construct a fence, and in some areas a wall, along the whole length of its border. This strategy worked because Israel was able to restrict the people crossing the border, often to work in Israel, of which there were many thousands, to narrow entrance points where they could be searched; people could not just wander across. The wall is a bad thing&#151;but it has served its purpose. I hope that when peace is restored, as I am confident it will be, one day it will be taken down. But remember always that on all these issues we can stand up and speak on one side or the other&#151;but in every case there are two sides and we need to look at them at the same time.</p>
<h5><a name="06120574000079"></a>5.34 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120574000001"></a><b><a name="61205-0007.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="06120574000084"></a>Lord Craig of Radley:</b> My Lords, one of the disturbing aspects about our military involvements in Iraq, and now Afghanistan, is the degree to which Her Majesty&#146;s Government, maybe unwittingly, have surrendered some control and authority over our Armed Forces. Let me make clear at the outset that nothing I say detracts from the high regard that I have for the way in which all three services, from top to bottom, have been performing to support the Government&#146;s wishes. I share the widespread admiration for their efforts. My particular criticism is focused on the slipshod way in which Her Majesty&#146;s Government have been prepared to deploy and commit our forces.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000002"></a>The timing of our initial military involvement in Iraq in 2003 was preceded by political restrictions on overt preparations which compressed timescales. It was not the best way to embark on a large-scale expeditionary operation. Moreover, we were committed to operations by the timing of the United States&#146; decision to invade Iraq and its declared and clear intention of achieving regime change. Our professed reason for participating was the removal of a threat from weapons of mass destruction, although it was not denied by the Government that if Saddam fell it would be most welcome.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000003"></a>So from the start there was some confusion about the strategic political aim of the coalition, and that could have affected the way in which the forces carried out their tasks. Fortunately, the Iraqi initial resistance was very poor and the divergence in aims did not cause the operational difficulties that could have arisen if the resistance had been stronger or more prolonged. It was also disturbing to learn that confirmation of the legality of our involvement had to be sought by the Chief of the Defence Staff of the day, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000004"></a>Both the US and UK Governments saw and characterised the invasion of Iraq as the actions of &#147;liberators&#148;. However, it was only a matter of months before we &#147;liberators&#148; were being recast as occupation forces, not least in the eyes of many Iraqis and some of their neighbours. The label &#147;occupation&#148; is now very widely used.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000005"></a>The Prime Minister and other Ministers have repeatedly said that our continuing deployment in Iraq would be governed by the wishes of the Iraqi  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1099"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1099</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government: we would stay or go at their request. The initiative on when to reduce or withdraw our forces is left not clearly with Her Majesty&#146;s Government but with the Iraq Government. As the weeks, months and even years have gone by, and with our additional involvement in Afghanistan, our forces have become over-committed on these two fronts.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000006"></a>By &#147;over-committed&#148; I mean that our forces are operating way beyond defence planning assumptions, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, has just mentioned, for which the defence budget had not been adequately funded, and for a protracted period of time. The situation has now developed to the state that difficulties with key enablers such as air transport and helicopters and a drawdown on essential operational training have become more and more critical. One cannot properly go to war, or take part in operations that may involve fighting or difficult peacekeeping, without adequate backing and preparation of additional or replacement units.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000007"></a>The actual or likely reduction in junior and middle rank officers and senior NCOs by resignation or early retirement can only cause further problems with bringing on and training new recruits. The worse this difficult situation becomes&#151;and time is not on our side&#151;the more important it is to be absolutely clear that the decisions about our deployments lie in the hands of our own Government and not that of another, no matter how friendly.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000008"></a>A further complication is that if the Americans are to continue to operate in the Baghdad area, the security of their lines of communication from Kuwait and the Gulf through the British zone around Basra will be of great importance to the US forces. In other words, the timing and scale of withdrawal of our forces might be decided not in our own national interest or to correct and relieve overstretch in our own forces, but on the wishes of the Americans and/or of an Iraqi Government whose writ does not seem to run widely in their own country.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000009"></a>That, again, is not to criticise the forces. Our participation was an inevitable consequence of the protracted high level of commitment in Iraq and because some NATO countries were reluctant to take part. In short, there was not enough to go round the two theatres at the more prudent levels of effort that would reflect and cater for uncertainties about the strength and determination of the opposition. Ministers admit that the scale of Taliban attacks was greater than had been anticipated&#151;certainly a great deal more than Dr Reid&#146;s forlorn hope, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, that our forces in Afghanistan might be there for three years without ever having to fire a shot.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000010"></a>Thanks to the superlative efforts of our forces, the Canadians and a few others, we have so far managed to dominate the battlefield in southern Afghanistan, sadly not without casualties. But is it realistic to believe that this can be done into the next year and beyond without deploying much greater strength in theatre than is there at present? The Government acknowledge now that this is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000011"></a>Why otherwise have the Prime Minister and Defence Secretary made so much effort to get other  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1100"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NATO nations to step up to the plate? Until those few that do so are trained for the intensity of operations&#151;and are then deployed&#151;the situation is not going to be eased. A rise in the casualty rate cannot be ruled out when faced with such determined and suicidal opponents. Redeploying forces following a drawdown in Iraq may be a help, but Her Majesty&#146;s Government should make it very much clearer that this is their intention and that they are not going to be overruled by one or more of our allies in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000012"></a>In his Chatham House speech last week, there were indications that the Defence Secretary&#146;s thinking was starting to move in that way. That is welcome as far as it goes. But my criticism is that the Government have for too long let it be understood that our deployments and even strengths in the two theatres were to be at the behest of the host nations or the US Government. Staying &#147;until the job is done&#148; or &#147;staying the course&#148; as our American allies have expressed it, is not a proper strategic posture when the levels of commitments are as high as they have been&#151;well above defence planning assumptions&#151;and so beyond by a considerable margin what ground forces in the front line and all three services in the key enabler areas of support are resourced, trained and able to sustain. I believe that the time has come to be far more robust and honest in our statement of future intentions. The service men and women who are out in theatre&#151;and those who are going to be committed in the coming months&#151;deserve a clearer understanding of what it will involve for them.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000013"></a>Even this line of approach may be overtaken by events. It is alarming that an individual as eminent as the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, as was widely reported last week, said that the war in Iraq could be considered a civil war. Kofi Annan was even more depressing, saying the situation was worse than civil war. If faced with open civil war in Iraq and the total loss of control by the Iraqi Government that that would imply, it might be necessary for us, the Americans and other coalition forces in Iraq to withdraw very rapidly&#151;even at the expense of having to leave behind valuable equipment and stores.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000014"></a>And whatever the future holds for us in Iraq, it is all too clear that far more effort is going to be necessary in Afghanistan&#151;and over a period of years&#151;if the Taliban is not to re-establish control in the southern areas of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000015"></a>The Foreign Minister in Pakistan was reported as saying the Taliban was going to win in Afghanistan and NATO was bound to fail. The Pakistan Foreign Ministry later said that their Minister&#146;s remarks had been misrepresented. Apparently he did not say that the Taliban was winning the war in Afghanistan and NATO was bound to fail. However he did emphasise that the military approach alone would not resolve the problems of Afghanistan. It must be combined with a political and economic approach. We and the local Afghan people need to see much more of that in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000016"></a>The Government, if they are minded to stay in Afghanistan, must speed the drawdown in Iraq and provide the increased resources that protracted expeditionary commitments require. Is it possible to  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1101"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continue to hold at the current level of forces in Afghanistan and not have to increase them? I doubt it. Even at present levels more is urgently required to support operations. Promises expressed by the Prime Minister last month on his visit to Afghanistan must be honoured. So far it is not clear that they are.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000017"></a>Without a much more full-blown commitment of resources, we may indeed lose out to the Taliban in southern Afghanistan. There will be no chance then for the political and economic levers of a co-ordinated strategy to work, to set Afghanistan on a stable footing. Whatever new direction we take, let the Government remember their responsibility not to over-commit the Armed Forces as has happened in pursuit of their objectives in Iraq and Afghanistan thus far.</p>
<h5><a name="06120574000080"></a>5.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120574000018"></a><b><a name="61205-0007.htm_spnew70"></a><a name="06120574000085"></a>Lord Turnberg:</b> My Lords, events in Israel and Palestine in the past couple of weeks have raised hopes yet again that there may be a way forward which will resolve their particular conflict. Ehud Olmert&#146;s positive speech and Mahmoud Abbas&#146;s enormous efforts are both very encouraging.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000019"></a>But optimism is not a word that one often uses about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and we do have to be realistic about what might be achieved. Nevertheless it seems not unreasonable to think that&#151;if left to themselves&#151;Abbas and Olmert could reach some form of agreement acceptable to both the Palestinians and Israelis even though it is likely to mean concessions by each of them. But I fear they will not be left to themselves and that a malign influence from elsewhere will determine the outcome. And it is in Syria&#151;and especially in Iran where the strings of Hamas and Hezbollah are being pulled&#151;where I believe we in the UK will have to focus our efforts if we are to be of any help at all.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000020"></a>Here in the UK and in this House it is common to criticise Israel for not doing enough or for doing the wrong things&#151;and of course there are many things for which we should be critical. Indeed that debate is going on even more vehemently in Israel itself than it is in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;difficult to believe but it is true. But in criticising Israel we do have to keep a sense of balance if we are to have any influence at all there&#151;or indeed among the Palestinians. And I fear we have little influence.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000021"></a>There is much talk here of putting pressure on Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians, to make concessions, to cease disproportionate responses to acts of terrorism, to accept a two-state solution and in return Israel will be able to live in peace and security. But that is just what Israel has been desperate to achieve itself. It is just what Ehud Olmert repeated in his speech of a couple of weeks ago, including the prospect of two states living in peace side by side. No one should imagine that Israel wants to continue to live in a state of siege and under constant threat of terrorist attacks. Nor can anyone look at the desperate plight of the Palestinians and think that peace and security is anything but what they are desperate to achieve. So what is stopping them?</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1102"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120574000022"></a>I agree with much of what other noble Lords have said, but I would like to put a slightly different slant on things.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000023"></a>Israel is about the size of north-west England, from where I hail&#151;about 30 miles wide and just over 200 miles long. It has more or less the same population as the north-west. If you look at the map of the Middle East it is a mere dot in an area the size of Europe made up of very hostile states stretching across Iran, Iraq and Syria. Israel not unnaturally feels extremely threatened by nations that have repeatedly tried to invade it since it was formed and are now promising its destruction even more vehemently.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000024"></a>You might ask whether withdrawing from Gaza has improved matters for either the Palestinians or the Israelis. And you might also ask whether there is any encouragement here for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank without the acceptance by Hamas and its leaders of Israel&#146;s right to exist. Remember that missiles fired from Gaza currently have a range of about eight miles and an independent, Hamas-run West Bank firing missiles with a similar range would have Israel&#151;30 miles wide&#151;in a very uncomfortable position. Just imagine if the population of Lancashire, for example, had several hundred rockets fired at them each month from Yorkshire on one side and north Wales on the other. They might expect the UK Government to intervene, especially if the rockets were being supplied from, say, France or Germany.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000025"></a>Israel&#146;s experience of withdrawal is not good, so what sort of reassurance can the UK Government or the UN give that its borders with the Palestinian state will be secure? Only a peace agreement, with all parties signed up, can give that reassurance, certainly not the UN or other external bodies. So when noble Lords talk of putting pressure on Israel to make concessions and negotiate, it is worth remembering that Israel was and is ready to do just that, but it needs someone to deal with. While it is clear that moderate Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas&#146;s leadership are ready and willing, it is far from certain what Hamas will do&#151;or, rather, what its leadership in Damascus will allow it to do. The report this weekend that Hamas is unwilling to work with Abbas yet again dampens the prospect of negotiations achieving a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000026"></a>Let me turn to where we might focus our mind if we are to help the Palestinians and Israelis reach a solution desirable to both; because the most strident voices against any form of peace agreement are in Hezbollah and Hamas and they, in turn, are the agents of Syria and Iran. There is no room to doubt now that they are funded, trained and controlled by those states. It seems equally clear that they do not have at heart the interests of not just the Israelis but the Palestinians or the Lebanese, for that matter. Can anyone seriously believe that Iran and Syria are concerned about the Palestinians or Lebanese when they risk the lives of women and children by not only siting their missiles and militia among them but also recruiting them to run forward whenever Israel threatens retaliation? That is pure cynical manipulation of the local population, sacrificed on the altar of extremism emanating from elsewhere.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1103"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120574000027"></a>The sources of the problem of the Middle East lie with Iran and Syria, and no amount of pressure on Israel will make any difference to Iran&#146;s desire to destroy it. To suggest that it is simply the current extreme leader in Iran spouting off for local consumption flies in the face of the evidence of years of preparation of Hamas and Hezbollah for the moment when they can put into effect their desire to remove Israel from the face of the Earth.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000028"></a>Then we come to Iraq, and the part proposed for Iran and Syria in its reconstruction. It is fascinating to hear the word &#147;reconstruction&#148; in relation to those two countries whose recent histories focus more on destruction&#151;unless, of course, you regard Syria&#146;s actions in Lebanon as aiding reconstruction. When I hear that these states might be courted to help in Iraq, I reflect on how Iran, which has been at war with Iraq on and off for years, may have had just a little twinge of satisfaction at the invasion by the western powers, and now it is being asked to take it over, with hardly any effort on its part. What an excellent position to be in. Clearly I am not nearly so sanguine as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, and some other noble Lords about Iran&#146;s role in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000029"></a>Let us look at what the result would be as and when the US and UK and other forces finally leave Iraq, as they must at some time. Iran is likely to ensure a Shia takeover after a war with the Sunnis; we will then have a huge and extraordinarily powerful block stretching from Iran, through Iraq and Syria and into Lebanon, with all the dangers that that entails for the rest of the world. I have heard that Israel is described by extremists as the little Satan and America as the big Satan. The UK and Europe are the medium-sized Satans. Examples of anti-western terrorist activities are pretty widespread across the world, and there is little comfort to be gained from hearing of Iran and Syria&#146;s potential role in Iraq, to say nothing of the severe threat that that poses for little Jordan and Israel in the middle.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000030"></a>Let us talk to Iran and Syria, but for that we need a very long spoon indeed. If the idea of wooing them is simply to extricate our troops from Iraq, then it sounds like realpolitik at its most short-sighted and it could be extremely dangerous for us and the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000031"></a>We must try to convince Israel to exert as much self-control as it can when it responds to suicide bombers and missile attacks. We must try to support it and the Palestinians in an even-handed way in any negotiations they may be able to initiate. But unless we also understand that the solution lies not in Israeli or even Palestinian hands, we will be whistling in the wind.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000032"></a>So is there anything useful we in the UK could be doing? I think there is. First, we must do all we can to support Mahmoud Abbas; we must try to channel funds to aid him and his fellow moderates. The situation for the Palestinians is desperate, and we must help him in his desire to gain the support of his people. It is vital, of course, that the funds are not diverted into arms for Hamas.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000033"></a>Secondly, we must enlist the support of other states in the region, especially Egypt and Saudi Arabia, but  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1104"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also the North African and Gulf states, Turkey and Jordan. If we in the UK are going to achieve anything at all, it will only be with the support and influence of these countries, which are not driven by a distorted, extreme religious fanaticism. We are unfortunate in having the recent distraction of the Serious Fraud Office investigation of aeroplane contracts with Saudi Arabia. We must solve that quickly; we cannot afford to be alienated from them at this critical time. We need all the friends in the Middle East we can get.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000034"></a>Thirdly, we should recognise that many inside Iran are very disturbed by the rhetoric and actions of their leaders. It is here that we might be able to see some internal changes, carried out not by external force but coming from within, through Iranians themselves. It is not easy, but many brave people there have been resisting the mullahs&#146; efforts to suppress them. The People&#146;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran is a non-violent resistance movement opposed to the current regime, and its members are suffering terribly because of their opposition. They are regularly tortured&#151;and publicly killed&#151;in Iran, yet despite that, their numbers are growing. They exist in large numbers outside Iran, here and in Europe. They also have a small town in Iraq called Ashraf, where for the moment they are safe, but the Iranian regime is seeking to destroy them. I fear that any deal struck with Iran over Iraq&#146;s future will see the immediate destruction of that town and the slaughter of its unarmed citizens.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000035"></a>This non-violent group, the PMOI, is currently on the UK&#146;s proscribed list of terrorist organisations. What a topsy-turvy world we live in when it is the current Iranian regime that should be on that list rather than those who oppose it. We must encourage a change in Iran, not by extreme actions by foreign nations but by the Iranians themselves. The first step might be the de-proscription of the PMOI.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000036"></a>I have tried to indicate that while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has to be resolved, it is no use simply focusing our pressures on Israel when the resolution depends to the same extent on Iran and Syria. It is there that we should focus our efforts. Incidentally, even if Israel and Palestine are finally settled, we will still have to face the problem posed by the Iranian brand of Islamic fundamentalism, so we may as well start there anyway.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000038"></a>As things stand, frankly, I know of no one who has a wholly acceptable, credible answer to the predicament that now afflicts the Americans and ourselves in Iraq. I put ourselves as second fiddle there, because that is plainly the role that we have played so far. The Baker-Hamilton commission reports to Congress tomorrow, but, if the leaks are  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1105"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anything to go by, it will not have a very satisfactory answer either. Our Prime Minister will be in Washington to contribute, I hope, to the President&#146;s response to the commission&#146;s recommendations. We hope that he does not echo the President&#146;s response too slavishly, without full regard to British interests.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000039"></a>The truth is that we are in a very weak position in Iraq. That weakness is reflected to a varying extent in Afghanistan and other areas of the Middle East where we are involved. The soft centre of that weakness is that, overall, the policies pursued to date are patently discredited and tainted with failure. Our errors were noted by James Baker in his autobiographical synopsis published yesterday, and many of them were mentioned by my noble friend Lord Blaker earlier in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000040"></a>No amount of spinning and happy hours of statistics can change that perception of failure. The American people have shown their dissatisfaction in the mid-term elections. A similar, deeply disappointed mood prevails among the electorate in this country. There is a clear demand for a change of course, but the path is fog-bound and not clearly visible. In the absence of a clear-cut alternative approach or a fresh, convincing strategy, eventual withdrawal from Iraq and decreased involvement elsewhere appear inevitable, which gives more than comfort to the insurgent forces that oppose us&#151;it inspires them to greater effort.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000041"></a>While the situation in Afghanistan under NATO&#146;s command may be less acute, the Taliban are certainly back at the gates of Kabul, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, indicated. One of their commanders recently told the <I>Times</I>:</p>
<ul><a name="06120574000073"></a>&#147;We are in no hurry ... look at how far we have come from nothing. We&#146;re in a guerrilla war. It isn&#146;t a matter of two or three years. It might take us ten, even thirty-five years. Will the foreign soldiers last that long here?&#148;.</ul><a name="06120574000067"></a>Those are the people who created 4.6 million refugees, who are now happily returning&#151;but for how long? I regard that statement by the commander as very telling when set alongside the disappointed attitudes prevailing in the West. 
<p><a name="06120574000042"></a>There is talk of negotiations with Syria and Iran to ease the tensions in the Shi&#146;ite areas where they are involved, from Lebanon to Afghanistan and Iraq. That in itself is a sign of weakness, as President Bush realises only too well. Iran was, after all, part of his &#147;axis of evil&#148;. As some of the speakers in this debate have said, such negotiations would be fraught with danger, including a greater role for those two states in neighbouring Shi&#146;ite territories. Their past record hardly inspires confidence. I understand that yesterday Mr Bush met the Shia leader, Mr al-Hakim, who heads the biggest block of MPs in the Iraqi Parliament. He is close to the Iranian leadership and, I am told, wants the Americans to stay in Iraq to deal with terrorists. He has his own militia of 25,000 men. He is opposed to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi army. I do not know what to make of that, except that there is clearly no unity even in the Shia sect.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000043"></a>If Iran persists and succeeds in developing its nuclear capabilities, its power will extend far beyond the Shi&#146;ite limits to the &#147;crescent&#148; described by the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Turnberg. So far, Iran has not indicated a willingness to negotiate with the United States on the nuclear issue in spite of a conditional offer to do so from the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, which itself represented a reversal of US policy. If such negotiations were to occur, in a fresh and broader political context that appealed to Tehran as a way of extending its influence, due regard should be paid to Henry Kissinger&#146;s recently expressed conclusion, in an article in the <I>Sunday Times </I>of 19 November, that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120574000077"></a>&#147;if, at the end of such a diplomacy, stands an Iranian nuclear capability and a political vacuum being filled by Iran, the impact on order in the Middle East will be catastrophic&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61205-0008.htm"/>


<a name="06120574000068"></a>The Sunni countries&#151;Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and others&#151;are already nervous at the prospect of the Shi&#146;ite accretion of power extending from Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon to Afghanistan. It is also difficult to see Israel standing idly by while her opponents mass themselves for a jihad against her. Israel might be tempted to make a pre-emptive strike. 
<p><a name="06120574000044"></a>Meanwhile, we are confronted daily with the atrocious situation in Iraq and the mounting toll of casualties caused by the seemingly senseless and murderous onslaught of the terrorist militias on the Shia-Sunni frontiers in Baghdad and elsewhere. Life, according to some&#151;including the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan&#151;is worse than it was under Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000045"></a>Iraq has a democratically elected Government, of which we had high hopes, but its Prime Minister, Mr al-Maliki, has pleaded with the United States for more power to be given to him. Certainly, something must be done to clean up the police and other forces to ensure their undivided loyalty to the state in the battle to establish order and stability. If social order is not restored, we cannot decently and honourably hand over power to the Iraqi Government and withdraw. At the end of the day, the people of Iraq will vote for a strong Government and secure that by hook or by crook, and we may be back where we started&#151;with another monstrous Saddam, or a fundamentalist regime ruthless in the execution of a merciless religious law.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000046"></a>The truth is that our choices are very limited. We are dealing with Islamic states and powers that have been aroused in a way and to an extent that we have not seen for centuries. They have an ancient faith-inspired strength that empowers individuals to alarming self-sacrificial actions, and counters the value and efficacy of modern weaponry. Our basic policy must be containment until we can safely disengage, but that disengagement is not currently in prospect. Precipitate disengagement could well have injurious repercussions here at home, if interpreted as a sign of weakness. It could encourage violent reactions. The only way to ensure peace and stability in Iraq is to convince the insurgents that they cannot win. I am afraid that, at this time, we are far from achieving that position.</p>

The International Crisis Group&#146;s Gareth Evans and Robert Malley recently wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120574000078"></a>&#147;the Arab-Israeli conflict has ceased being a local, or even a regional concern. It is an international one, with obvious ripple effects in the rise of Islamic militancy and terrorism&#148;.</ul><a name="06120574000069"></a>In my own limited experience, in places as far away as Sudan and Bangladesh, I have heard politicians and ordinary citizens link the Palestinian cause to terrorism&#151;and, indeed, to al-Qaeda. We may hesitate there, but at the very least Palestine is used as a propaganda weapon in many countries, against both the USA and our country, because of our support for Israel. Nothing is more urgent than addressing that problem. 
<p><a name="06120574000048"></a>Ten days ago, a ceasefire was declared in Gaza. Does that mean an end to the suffering of the Palestinians? Indeed, does it mean an end to the fear of attack endured by Israelis who live in what I have previously described as a &#147;gilded cage&#148;? I will not dwell here on the humiliation of the Palestinians and the destruction of their lives, for the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester described it graphically. But for people who do not know about it, it is well recorded in our own Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s human rights report published this autumn. Although the report neglected to mention the action in Lebanon&#151;a grave omission, in some people&#146;s view&#151;it nevertheless gives a graphic account of Palestinian suffering. If your Lordships have any more doubt, look at the <I>Independent</I> today. Insult has been added to injury by withdrawing revenue and aid, and by refusing to talk to a democratically elected Government in Palestine. Thousands of Iraqis and many of our own citizens&#151;and American citizens&#151;are dying for democracy in the Iraq war. What hypocrites we are.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000049"></a>The treatment of the Palestinians by Israel defies international law and the Geneva Convention; it abuses their human rights. Over 60 United Nations resolutions have been ignored by Israel. Why do we allow that to go on? Why can Israel continue its actions when other countries have sanctions imposed, or are invaded, for less? Why do we carry on trading arms with a country that uses them for external aggression or for internal oppression? Depending on how your Lordships see Palestine, it is certainly one or the other, but they are both forbidden under our arms control laws. What is the future for Israel, which we all want to survive? She makes no friends in all of this; the recent Nation Brands Index survey, as reported in no less than the <I>Jewish Chronicle</I> last Friday, showed Israel gaining bottom ranking in nearly every question&#151;and bottom overall in a table of 35 countries. How can Israel go on like that? She must realise that the hegemony of the USA will not last for ever, and what happens then?</p>

<p><a name="06120574000050"></a>My recent contention that a factor in all this is the activity of the pro-Israel lobby operating in the West has got me into big trouble, and led to accusations of anti-Semitism. I would like to sincerely apologise to colleagues in my party and elsewhere, and to Jewish people all over the country, who may have misunderstood my remarks. I beg leave to try to explain them. &#147;The Israel Lobby&#148; is the title of a  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1108"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>paper written by Professors Mearsheimer and Walt of Chicago and Harvard universities. It is not the only paper on the subject. It is well researched and authoritative. The authors conclude that the lobby exerts a huge influence on US politicians and foreign policy. That is their conclusion and anyone can draw their own.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000051"></a>Let us remember that the lobby to which they refer is not composed simply of Zionists. There are many neo-conservatives and right-wing Christian evangelists in that lobby&#146;s huge, wide coalition of people. Criticism of the lobby therefore cannot be called anti-Semitic. It is not anti-Semitic to criticise either the lobby or the actions of the Israeli Government. It may be said that to do so is simply used as an excuse to be anti-Semitic, which I accept; I have heard that said many times. Yet the reverse is also true. Accusations of anti-Semitism can be used as a smokescreen to shield the actions of Israel from censure and to silence her opponents. I am not anti-Semitic&#151;I will challenge anyone who accuses me of that disgusting sentiment&#151;but I am horrified by decades of inaction by the international community in dealing with the occupation of Palestine, and the damage that that is doing to the Jewish diaspora, who contribute so much to all our lives.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000052"></a>I wish to refer here to the late Yehoshafat Harkabi and his book <I>Israel&#146;s Fateful Hour</I>, which was published in 1988. Noble Lords may know that he was chief of Israel&#146;s military intelligence from 1955 to 1959. He said:</p>
<ul><a name="06120574000074"></a>&#147;Israel is the criterion according to which all Jews will tend to be judged. Israel as a Jewish state is an example of the Jewish character, which finds free and concentrated expression within it. Anti-Semitism has deep and historical roots. Nevertheless, any flaw in Israeli conduct, which initially is cited as anti-Israelism, is likely to be transformed into empirical proof of the validity of anti-Semitism&#148;,</ul><a name="06120574000070"></a>as I mentioned earlier. He went on to say: <ul><a name="06120574000075"></a>&#147;It would be a tragic irony if the Jewish state, which was intended to solve the problem of anti-Semitism, was to become a factor in the rise of anti-Semitism. Israelis must be aware that the price of their misconduct is paid not only by them but also Jews throughout the world&#148;.</ul><a name="06120574000071"></a>That was said in 1988 by an Israeli minister. 
<p><a name="06120574000053"></a>In defending Israel&#146;s right to exist&#151;and its right to defend itself, which I do&#151;I must congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, on his speech this evening. It was extremely thought-provoking; he gave a very interesting and delicate view of the other side, for which I thank him. Yet we must also now insist that Israel obeys international law, withdraws from the Occupied Territories, dismantles the settlements and, as one of my beloved grandchildren&#151;eight year-old George&#151;likes to say, &#147;Give those people their land back&#148;. I say to my noble friend Lord Jacobs that while the need for a protective wall can be justified&#151;and I have said that openly&#151;its construction did not have to take even more Palestinian land. The wall, if it was needed, could have been built on Israeli land.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000054"></a>The Holocaust was the worst event in human history; we must never forget it. But, in making amends for that terrible event, we cannot condemn millions of innocent Palestinians to humiliation and

There is now another opportunity for progress. A ceasefire has been agreed between Israel and Gaza, but, sadly, not with the West Bank. This brave initiative of Prime Minister Olmert two weeks ago is very welcome and we have heard many comments about it this evening, but it will not work if the Israel Defence Forces continue to terrify Palestinians with overflights, sonic booms, humiliation at checkpoints, arrests, arbitrary detention, the relentless expansion of West Bank settlements and targeted assassinations. Such actions provoke trapped Palestinians until they take action and break the ceasefire. As my noble friend Lady Williams said, Gideon Levy&#146;s recent article in <I>Haaretz</I> pointed out many examples of where this has occurred and where the Palestinians have been provoked into taking action following the actions of the Israel Defence Forces and Shin Bet. Gideon Levy asks:</p>
<ul><a name="06120574000076"></a>&#147;Who rules in Israel and who is really dictating its path?&#148;.</ul><a name="06120574000072"></a>He calls on all Israelis and Palestinians to monitor the ceasefire that has just been called and to examine both sides carefully in the next few weeks to determine what is going on.
<p><a name="06120574000055"></a>Nevertheless, this new initiative is welcome and we must all have great hope for it. The news that leaders of United Kingdom churches are at last going to Bethlehem and the Holy Land is also welcome. I am extremely moved by their action and thank them for it. This Christmas they will visit Bethlehem and the Holy Land to remind Israel and the Palestinians that it is also a centre for the Christian faith and its message of peace and loving one another.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000056"></a><b><a name="61205-0008.htm_spnew73"></a><a name="06120574000088"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> My Lords, reading the <I>Hansard</I> account of your Lordships&#146; discussion of foreign and security policies during the debate on the humble Address was a rather sobering experience. Not only did the twin cuckoos of Iraq and Afghanistan seem to drive every other foreign policy issue, whether the future of the European Union, the fate of Africa or the problems of world trade and climate change, into the margins, but the whole tone of the debate was shot through with anger and despair, with few enough suggestions for adjustments to the policies which were so widely criticised. This is sad, but it is a fact and it reflects a general mood in this country, encouraged, it needs to be recognised, by a media which simply ignore any positive stories that emerge in either of the combat zones in which our troops are currently engaged.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000057"></a>Today, we have an opportunity to return to those two burning topics of the hour and to look more widely at the problems of the Middle East. I should like to make a modest contribution to a shift in emphasis away from Stygian gloom towards remedial action. I very much welcome the fact that a number of participants in the debate have taken a similar course.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000058"></a>First, I make a plea to decouple in our thinking those twin issues of Iraq and Afghanistan. They are two very different countries in two very different regions. No doubt someone will forgive the speech writer who coined the meaningless and misleading  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>phrase, &#147;The wider Middle East&#148;, but I shall not readily do so. They are subject to quite different considerations and need quite different policy prescriptions. The costs of failure in each will also be very different. Linking them together, therefore, serves no useful purpose; it merely makes it more likely that failure, or relative failure, in one will drag down the other.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000059"></a>Looking first at Iraq, much attention is currently being given to the possibility of enlisting its neighbours, in particular Syria and Iran, in an effort to stabilise the country and check the sectarian violence. I welcome that attention, having myself called for a regional approach to security issues since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, but we need to approach this issue in a serious and systematic way. It is no good thinking that an appeal to Syria&#146;s and Iran&#146;s better feelings, because we are in a pickle, is going to bring a positive response. Nor should any attempt to bring in Iraq&#146;s neighbours be confined to these two countries. It surely needs to encompass all Iraq&#146;s neighbours, not just the ones which cause the most trouble. So that means bringing in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, Jordan and Turkey too. To what should we try to bring them in? Not, I suggest, some one-off conference, which would be long on words and short on follow-up. Surely, what is needed is to give all these countries, including Iraq, of course, a long-term stake and a long-term say in the stability of their region. That could mean a regional organisation which would give legal guarantees of non-intervention, systematise co-operation across a whole range of policy areas and provide for in-depth confidence building measures between its members.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000060"></a>I can already hear critics saying how utterly unrealistic all that is in the present fraught state of affairs, or asking how we can offer such openings to Iran or Syria when we are still at odds with them over nuclear and other issues. Well, what are the alternatives? Might not giving Iran and Syria a real stake in regional security make some of the other problems that we have with them easier, not more difficult, to resolve?</p>

<p><a name="06120574000061"></a>I suggest that on one point we need to be clear. The disintegration of Iraq into three separate states would be an unmitigated disaster likely to lead to intervention by its neighbours and to a wider conflict even than the one that currently exists. Because any such conflict would risk involving the vital interests of all western countries, it would not be one from which we could afford to stand aside or from whose consequences we would be protected. So, by all means&#151;I would strongly support this&#151;let us have a federal Iraq with considerable powers devolved to its three component regions, although a functioning central Government and an equitable sharing of oil revenues would be essential if that were to work. But let us not be seduced by those siren voices from across the Atlantic, which sometimes argue that we could contemplate the break-up of Iraq with equanimity.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000062"></a>Afghanistan, it seems to me, is a quite different set of problems, and one where the prospects for a relatively successful outcome are a good deal better. There, too, there is a need for a regional approach, although with  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1111"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a quite different group of countries, Iran being the only common factor with the neighbours of Iraq. Afghanistan&#146;s neighbours have often meddled in its affairs in the past, just as Afghanistan has meddled in theirs. The single most vulnerable point now, as it has often been in the past, is the porous border with Pakistan&#146;s tribal areas, which are not fully under the control of the central Government.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000063"></a>In the case of Afghanistan, too, the establishment of some kind of regional grouping with strong, binding commitments to stabilisation and co-operation would seem to be highly desirable. At the same time, along with others who have spoken, I hope that we would take another careful look at our policies on drug eradication, which, as currently designed and implemented, seem likely to cut right across attempts to provide security and development in the south of the country, and which do not seem to be getting to grips with the corruption and drug traders in high places within the Government machine.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000064"></a>That brings me to the one issue that truly impacts on both Iraq and Afghanistan, as it does on the whole battle that we are waging against terrorism, and that is the sorry state of efforts to resolve the problem of Palestine. If anyone doubted that a policy of neglect and unilaterally imposed solutions was doomed to failure, recent events in Lebanon and Gaza have surely blown aside those doubts. At the same time, there are few, if any, signs, of a purposeful move back to a peace process which, over many long and weary years, has become discredited. I would except from that criticism the recent speech by Prime Minister Ohlmet, which seemed to be a very serious attempt to send a signal. However discredited that peace process may be, there really is no practical alternative if we are to avoid periodic outbreaks of hostility and if we are to leech away the poison of Islamic fundamentalism. The time has now come, as many others who have spoken in this debate have said, for a renewed effort.</p>

<p><a name="06120574000065"></a>Perhaps it is also time to move away&#151;and here I differ from many others&#151;from the staged approach characterised by the much referred-to road map, which seems, so far at any rate, always to founder on the mutual distrust of the two sides so long as the final status issues are not being addressed. We should move towards negotiations more like those at Camp David in 2000, which did address those final status issues. Can we expect a lead from the same direction that gave a lead in 2000; namely, the US Administration? I fear not. There I entirely agree with those, including the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who cast doubt on whether the present US Administration look likely to give any such lead in the next two years. I do not believe that they are going to do so. Can the Europeans, at least, begin to move ahead, working with both Arabs and Israelis, to prepare the ground? I believe that they can and should. After all, the European initiative in 1980, led by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, who was here at the beginning of today&#146;s debate, paved the way towards acceptance of a two-state solution. That initiative, though much criticised by the Americans at the time, was later accepted by them.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120574000066"></a>Like others, I regret that our Government were not part of the initiative recently taken by the French, Spanish and Italian Governments; perhaps they can now catch up with that and ensure that the European Union as a whole, with its considerable influence, begins to stake out the ground for a comprehensive settlement. The appointment of a politically prominent European Union figure with a strong official-level back-up team might be one way to get the ball rolling. I would not see that as in any way abandoning the use of the quartet as an essential co-ordinating instrument. Indeed, the new UN Secretary-General, a very welcome visitor to this city today and tomorrow, would be an essential part of that and could become a very important player, along with the EU, in a renewed effort to build momentum towards peace negotiations. As so often, there are, no doubt, plenty of objections to proceeding in this way. People will say that nothing can be done without the Americans. True&#151;up to a point: nothing can be completed without the Americans. There is no question of a Middle East peace settlement being agreed without full American involvement and endorsement. Does that mean that we have to wait until they are ready to move? I do not think so. Doing nothing much while the Middle East burns again is surely the worst of all policy prescriptions.</p>
<h5><a name="06120586000056"></a>6.33 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120586000001"></a><b><a name="61205-0008.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="06120586000061"></a>Lord Soley:</b> My Lords, I begin my comments on Iraq by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, whom I heard with interest confess to being one of few Members on the Liberal Benches to support intervention. He should not be ashamed of that. The reality of Iraq&#151;and I think without any doubt that historians will say this&#151;is that it is a classic example of how to win a war and lose the subsequent peace. As many have already said, problems started after the disbanding of the army, the police and much of the civil structure governing the country. Unlike some others who have spoken on this today, I have taken time to look at the background to that. I say that because I took the view, as they did, that the mistake was for there to have been no planning at all. In fact there was. That is what I learnt and that is why I have changed my view slightly on this.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000002"></a>If you read the recently published book&#151;reviewed in the latest International Institute for Strategic Studies quarterly survey&#151;by David Phillips, one of the advisers to the United States during the whole period of planning for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, you will see that there was considerable planning over a long period. The deadly mistake was to override what was happening, for which I would put a lot of responsibility on Donald Rumsfeld, who took the decision to do so. The political drive from Washington, led largely by Donald Rumsfeld, to take such action stripped the Iraqi state of any administrative structure. I agree with my noble friend Lady Symons, who commented that she was rather glad when Donald Rumsfeld went. My only regret is that he left it four years too late. It was not a surprise when, without the policing of borders, and with police and army officers having been sent into permanent unemployment, but with  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their weapons intact, there was a problem. I remember how my heart sank when I heard what had happened. If I have regrets about that period in 2003, it is that we did not hold the United States strongly enough to a post-conflict policy.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000003"></a>The other thing that I want to say about this is very important; I wrote a pamphlet about it in 2003, which got some publicity at the time. It concerns the policy of intervention. There are a lot of people running around at the moment saying that we should have followed the United Nations. Remember this: almost every intervention that has taken place in recent years has happened without UN approval. Kosovo did not have UN approval. Bosnia, as my noble friend will know, was a case where we should have intervened, because some of the paramilitary groups began to arm and fight&#151;perhaps not unreasonably&#151;when they saw white European Christians murdering and raping white European Muslims, while Europe did nothing about it. The lesson learnt from that for many such groups was to start arming and to start fighting, because the Europeans will not do anything to help. Further back, the removal of Pol Pot by the Vietnamese, the removal of Idi Amin by the Tanzanians and, indeed, the removal of East Pakistan&#146;s Government from Bangladesh by the Indians all happened without UN support.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000004"></a>Part of the problem is that the United Nations, which was frozen during the Cold War, is still unable to work effectively. I am a great supporter of the United Nations, but let us not kid ourselves that somehow or other the system is working at the moment. This is why I said in my pamphlet that the other big mistake in Iraq was not to have removed Saddam Hussein when we had the Muslim nations on side. This was during the invasion of Kuwait, and the period immediately after that, when the first material breach of the ceasefire by Saddam Hussein occurred. This was a material breach that meant that the ceasefire no longer functioned, and the UN did virtually nothing other than start imposing sanctions. As so often with brutal dictatorships, these were targeted against the opposition groups within the country, while the dictator protected his own friends and family. Again, we took no action. The history of this is rather different from how it was painted at the time. The post-conflict situation has been disastrous. I have no illusions about that. Our position in Iraq should not have come about, but it did for that reason, and not because we removed Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000005"></a>I should declare an interest as chairman of a charity, the Arab-Jewish Forum, which I set up at that time because many of the Arabs in my then constituency of Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush approached me to say that they wanted rid of Saddam Hussein. Indeed, a leader of one mosque asked whether, rather than invade, we could send in the SAS to kill him. Many felt like that at the time. What they asked me to do was to find some way of dealing with the core issue, referred to by so many Members today, of Israel and Palestine. I was not sure what I could do, but we found that there was no organisation that addressed both the diaspora of Jews and the diaspora of Arabs in this country. So we formed the Arab-Jewish Forum.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000006"></a>I have a vice-chairman, Atallah Said, who is a Palestinian by origin. Originally, he believed in wiping Israel off the face of the map, but he is now a strong supporter of the road-map approach. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that the road map should not be regarded as dead&#151;indeed, I think that we must enliven it again. The forum also has a Jewish vice-chairman, Tony Klug. I thought that it would be run by Arab Jews and that I, not being an Arab Jew, would be able to leave the scene. Unfortunately, the members decided that it would be best if someone who was not an Arab or a Jew chaired it, and I think that that is beginning to work. The forum has held a number of conferences&#151;we will have more&#151;at which it has looked at the relationship between Arabs and Jews. Over several thousand years, on the whole that relationship has been very positive, although there have been periods in which it has gone badly wrong and the present is one of them.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000007"></a>In the context of changing policies, Condoleezza Rice made a very important speech in January or February of this year in Egypt. She said that the big mistake in United States policy since 1945 has been to back almost every regime in power in the Middle East that looked as though it could retain power. Frankly, when she said that, everyone in Europe and elsewhere should have pleaded guilty too, particularly in France and Britain, because that has been our policy. As she pointed out, we should all have encouraged, brought forward and supported the organisations, parties, groups and others that supported the emergence of the rule of law, democracy and human rights, as those are the only ultimate guarantees of peace between nations.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000008"></a>When the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said that that is not within the Labour Party&#146;s policy of internationalism, I simply say that my internationalism recognises that the nation state is vital, but it certainly does not recognise that the nation state can do anything that it likes with its population. It is the people that matter, not the boundary of the nation state. That is why in the document that I wrote in 2003, when there was so much argument on this subject, I said that our approach to Saddam Hussein had been very similar to our approach to domestic violence in this country 50-odd years ago. Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait and we get him out&#151;we stop him straight away&#151;but, if he does it to his own people, we take no action. That is just like our previous domestic policy in which, if a man beat up his wife in the street, we arrested him but, if he did it at home, that was all right. In that sense, our policy towards nation states is very similar to the &#147;Englishman&#146;s home is his castle&#148; approach of 50 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000009"></a>We know that we cannot change things quickly, but I say to the Liberal Democrats that they need to recognise that internationalism is not just about nation states, and it is certainly not just about doing precisely what the United Nations says. The reality is that we would not have intervened in any of those cases. Indeed, our problem was in not intervening in Bosnia or Rwanda and probably, I am sad to say, it will be in not intervening in Darfur, where the number of killings will be just as great. Because we see the events on television, Iraq or Afghanistan are  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1115"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considered to be terrible, but, just because we do not see events in Burma, North Korea or wherever, that does not mean to say that they are not happening. They are happening and we need to know that and think about it.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000010"></a>The process in these conflict situations is extremely important. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, with his considerable experience, also referred to that. A process must be started, above all, on Israel and Palestine. I accept what everyone else has said about that. It is a way of disconnecting the extremists from the moderates. Our own evidence from Northern Ireland shows that the process has to start with talking. Again, I agree with my noble friend Lady Symons that we should not be too fussy about whom we talk to, but how and when we talk to them is a matter of judgment. I talked to the political representatives of the military wings of both the unionists and the republicans in Northern Ireland and got into considerable trouble for it at the time with the media and the Conservatives, only to discover a few years later that they were already talking to them. I should have saved my time and stayed at home watching television.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000011"></a>However, the reality is that that sort of talking is necessary to get to the point of a process. When you get that process moving, you can then start to talk about the things that are necessary to move towards a more stable situation where justice for both sides is recognised. It would be a mistake to line up against the Israelis or the Arabs in a simplistic sense, because that only loses you influence with one side or the other. The Prime Minister recognises that rather well. It is a case of recognising that you maintain your influence only if you are listened to in both cases. If you have power, you can impose it; if you have influence, you have to use it in whatever way you can, and often that is not as easy as it looks.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000012"></a>At times, particularly when listening to debates in continental Europe and increasingly, I am sorry to say, when listening to debates here, I am troubled when people place an almost moral and political equivalence between tyrannical despotic states and states that have the rule of law, democracy and human rights. There is no moral and political equivalence. That does not mean that you do not bother to talk to people at all or try to make arrangements with them from time to time, but it is very important that you never lose sight of that lack of equivalence. If you do, you begin to think, first, that the state that is under a tyrant is popular, which it almost always is not, and, secondly, that somehow or other you will get peace if you simply make peace with that state. From our experience in the run-up to the Second World War, this country should remember that well. It does not work in that way and it never has.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000013"></a>Modernisation is happening in the Middle East and, in my view, a modernisation struggle is also going on within Islam. If we look at what is being debated in the Muslim press both here and overseas, we see that a struggle is going on for the heart and soul of Islam. It is an important struggle which perhaps we cannot do much about, but we must recognise that it is happening and, as my noble friend  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Triesman said in his opening comments, we must recognise that a lot of states in the Middle East are leaping ahead. Whether it is Dubai, Kuwait or Morocco, they are making considerable progress. It is not a total disaster area from one end to the other, and we should not look at it in that way. If we do, to some extent we make the mistake that occurred in the United States: a British officer, perhaps rightly, said that there was institutional racism in the US Armed Forces against Arabs, and I think that there is some truth in that.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000014"></a>I shall end with a brief comment on Afghanistan. I agree with much of what has been said, but I wish to add one point. When people plead for NATO, us and everyone else to put more emphasis on reconstruction and less on the military side, they should remember that the people who lead the opposition to us, whether there or in other parts of the world, also read books about asymmetric warfare and about winning hearts and minds. If they enter an area in Afghanistan where there are no western forces and they shoot a headmaster or kill a government officer and so on, they know what they are doing. It is not some bizarre accident; they are trying to say, &#147;You can&#146;t govern this country and you, the people of Afghanistan, had better remember that when they&#146;ve gone, we&#146;ll still be here&#148;. Again, we experienced that in Northern Ireland. We tried to get Catholics to join the police force. It was not simply that they did not want to join; it was that, if they did join, at best their families were pressured and threatened and, at worst, they were shot. That is how it worked. Sometimes, people do not believe that these groups and organisations have brains at the top. They do, and they adjust their policies, tactics and strategies in much the same way as people do in Britain, America or anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000015"></a>Although there is a long road ahead, I am not wholly despondent about the Middle East: the present moves between Israel and Palestine are very encouraging. I think that we could do more to use the diaspora communities of Arabs and Jews in this country and elsewhere rather more effectively and in much the same way as the British-Irish Association underpinned many of the things that we did in Ireland.</p>

Afghanistan has been subject to almost 200 years of continuous foreign intervention because of its geographical position. Being between what was British India, now Pakistan, and the tsarist and then Soviet empire, and east of a long frontier with Persia, now Iran, has made Afghanistan the subject of continuous interest. Time after time, the scale of foreign intervention has turned Afghanistan into a client state, the rules of the game having little to do with Afghan interests yet the outcome of each engagement being of no more than tactical importance to the players&#151;short-term policy dominated, first, London, Delhi and Moscow and

<p><a name="06120586000017"></a>No longer can we rely on short-term policies. The risks are unacceptable. Afghanistan's 24 million people have acquired a geopolitical importance which fully engages with our strategic interests. In the past 30 years, there has also been extreme ideological intervention in Afghanistan. There was the break-up of the monarchy, with its complex history of succession; the rise of Marxist/Leninist factions; the arrival of the Soviets, and the Islamist response to their departure; the medieval Taliban regime demonstrating extremism at its worst&#151;and all that in contrast to Afghanistan before the early 1970s. Until then the moderate Hanafi school of Sunni Islam predominated. Indeed, the 1964 constitution, while recognising Hanafi practice, wrote in a separation of powers and established a system of secular courts. The attempt was only partially successful, as was the system of elections to the parliament.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000018"></a>Nevertheless, the Afghan people have not been attracted to centralisation and command and control, choosing instead to maintain their many differing societies, consistent with ethnic grouping; for example, the Uzbek and Tajik people of the north, living south of the River Armu beyond which lie Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The largest and often dominant ethnic group in the south, the Pashtuns, are divided between Afghanistan and Pakistan by the Durand line of 1893. That settlement has been, and remains, a source of discontent and dispute. It has contributed to major changes in Pakistani policy, from backing the Taliban to today's expressions of support for the US-led war on terror. I hope that the Government are more certain than I am about the continuing role of the Pakistani directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Has that leopard fully changed its spots? If a Taliban fighter, once trained, is paid more than an Afghan policeman, it spells trouble.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000019"></a>Economically, Afghanistan suffers from being landlocked and having very difficult terrain and a climate of extremes. Although it has natural resources, they are difficult to develop. Given an income of less than $1 a day per head of population, a third of which comes from narcotics, President Musharraf has a point when calling for economic development on the lines of the Marshall Plan. One thoughtful estimate proposes a $20 billion investment programme in addition to present official aid, which is nearly all aimed at current government expenditure. Indeed, if the institutions which are necessary to a successful 21st century state are to develop, Afghanistan's income per head needs to rise sharply. In any chicken-and-egg analysis, income needs to rise first to achieve democratic institutions and not the other way around; nor is there any way in which the necessary capital formation can come from the savings of people as poor as the Afghans. Taxation

<p><a name="06120586000020"></a>Whether for reasons of the West's relationship with Islam, of the geopolitical balance in the region or the need to see NATO succeed, it is in our interests to stay with the challenging problems of Afghanistan and to see the country through to becoming a stable, significantly secular state, at peace with itself and its neighbours, a state to which many more far-flung expatriates will wish to return and which can play a part in the global economy. Membership of the global economy is now a necessary condition for peace and stability. In total, those objectives are way beyond any task that we have so far set ourselves, the most difficult challenge being the separation of religion from secular society in a country committed to development. Malaysia has shown that that can be done, as has Indonesia, at least so far.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000021"></a>Considering our present contribution, our forces on the ground come first with their professionalism and long experience of countering terrorism and civil disorder. It is right that we praise them, but what task have we set them? Does it include knowledge and involvement in economic development alongside the Department for International Development, the World Bank and NATO? What about the economic implications of the long-running dispute with Iran over the use of the waters of the River Helmand, or do we look only for less Taliban-led disruption and violence and for the destruction of poppies? What happens after that? As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, said, imagination is needed.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000022"></a>On the DfID website the country profile of Afghanistan is instructive and depressing. Its opening description is pessimistic. Its catalogue of comparatively small aid initiatives is focused on support to a Government who do not inspire DfID's confidence. Amazingly, its pages make no mention of NATO or of British troops on the ground. While the World Bank recognises that major private sector development is vital for sustainable economic progress, DfID confines itself to micro-initiatives. None of that will give the Afghans confidence that there is a substitute for poppy income and none is in prospect. As DfID says, its plans, which are short term, do not deal with medium- and long-term economic challenges. The economic issues faced by Afghanistan have changed those rules too.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000023"></a>DfID needs to think through its intellectual approach. Just what level of income per head would provide a better chance of peace and stability, and how could we achieve it? What about a well targeted $20 billion investment in productive assets, with a security situation which did not unduly affect the costs of construction? A co-ordinated approach led by the Washington institutions incorporating Europe-wide and bilateral programmes should be carefully examined. In default of a co-ordinated development strategy, it is not enough to call it reconstruction. We are in danger of repeating the post-war issues of Iraq. Yet, with a strategy, we could lift Afghan incomes to between $800 and $1,000 a head. That might break the cycle of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000024"></a>It will be recognised that such a determined and expensive strategy would be difficult to sell to domestic electorates, but it is not impossible. The more than 600 million people of north America and Europe are well capable of lifting 24 million Afghans out of poverty. The great benefits of demonstrating that the West can succeed do not need elaboration; they are obvious.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000025"></a>Let us not do half a job: going as far as lessening violence, then losing interest, as the United States of America might do if the war on terrorism were to take a better or a different turn. Let us persist and finish the job. A thousand dollars a head is not riches, but it would be a great deal better than $300.</p>

We should beware of rhetoric&#151;our own and that of others, including enemies.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000027"></a>The war on terror, or terrorism, is an idle phrase because states of mind and ideologies cannot be overcome by military means. War on terrorists is possible, but they must first be identified, usually by good intelligence. If one lot of active terrorists is eliminated, another group is all too likely to spring up unless local hearts and minds have first been won over. That can seldom be done by force of arms. The terrorist&#151;or freedom-fighter, as he probably sees himself&#151;conducts an asymmetrical hit-and-run kind of war. Experience of this in Northern Ireland and in a variety of other post-imperial situations shows that clear-cut military victory can seldom be achieved, as indeed Israel has discovered on several occasions in Lebanon.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000028"></a>We should study carefully the findings of the American academic Mr R A Pape of Chicago, who examined hundreds of suicide bombings since 1980 and found that few were committed by intensely religious people. More than 90 per cent were carried out by young people moved by anger and despair directly related to perceived or real occupation of land by foreign forces&#151;usually, I am sorry to say, democratic ones. This perhaps also points to the need to distinguish between ordinary bombings and those with the added dimension of suicide. We should avoid a black-and-white analysis of absolute good on the one hand and absolute evil on the other. It is surely dangerous to lump together all forms of extreme violence.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000029"></a>We should note that in Iraq the absence of law and order has given scope for kidnapping and extortion. It has probably allowed latent sectarianism to drive out those seen as a threat. It is important to distinguish between violence that stems from grievances or suppressed identities and that which is ideological or religious.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000030"></a>It is clear already that our foreign and home policies cannot be other than closely connected. That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. It is in our real interest to secure the greatest possible degree of world peace and the maximum social cohesion at home. This does not mean that we should give way to threats or violence. It means, however, that we should know the conflicting parties and distinguish those

<p><a name="06120586000031"></a>A second important British interest is not to follow slavishly in the wake of American foreign policy without receiving tangible benefits for doing so. We seem to have somewhat different conceptions of democracy and the rule of law. A more detached alliance with the United States might allow us to improve the effectiveness of our own Armed Forces and give stronger leadership on urgent global issues, such as climate change or the reform of world institutions.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000032"></a>In the Middle East, we should explore the aims and goals of Hamas and Hezbollah. I agree very much with the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean. We may think we know what they want, but are we accurate and fully up to date? We should bear in mind that each of those movements is rooted in a single population; each has democratic credibility and has shown that it can provide a certain standard of honest local administration; each represents a wider constituency than just its own members. Neither movement appears to have plans for worldwide revolution.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000033"></a>I hope that it is not too heretical to suggest that this kind of thinking should be extended to al-Qaeda. Of course this network has blood on its hands, but so did the Mau Mau, the EOKA and the IRA. Surely it is right to offer non-violent options to all fringe and extremist groups to reduce the attractions of force and increase the rewards of dialogue. Al-Qaeda appears to have operated as a manager or link between a variety of terror franchises. Is it beyond the bounds of possibility to discover from the central nucleus whether there may be points at which a negotiating process could begin? This may be particularly relevant to Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000034"></a>In our previous debate on Israel and Palestine, I called for,</p>
<ul><a name="06120586000055"></a>&#147;maximum diplomatic effort to achieve ceasefires and an early start to negotiations&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/11/06; col. 110.]</ul>
<p><a name="06120586000035"></a>Since then, it is encouraging to say, ceasefires and some talks about talks have begun. There have also been changes within the United States Government and possibly new approaches there to diplomatic priorities. In my view, Israel and Palestine remain the key sector. Our diplomats, supplemented on occasion by voluntary organisations and academics, are a key asset. Their skills of analysis and discernment should be given full scope. They should be listened to with the greatest care. Why should they go on reporting if their reports remain unread?</p>

<p><a name="06120586000036"></a>I return to my theme of language. The word &#147;Sulha&#148; describes an ancient Arab and Middle East practice of reconciliation between warlike tribes. It has existed for centuries to prevent acts of revenge and disastrous feuds. Sulha builds in collective wisdom and common legal principles. The good news is that the Sulha Peace Project, closely linked with the three faiths Abrahamic Reunion, is working to bring Israelis and Palestinians into dialogue and towards joint action for peace. Some of their members are even able to cross into Lebanon and act as intermediaries there. The Sulha Peace Project is only

<p><a name="06120586000037"></a>There can be no doubt that diplomatic effort is needed, but it must be supplemented by civil society and religious leadership to create public opinion that will not be satisfied until real progress is made towards the just and lasting peace that we all desire. I say long live the diplomatic, civil and religious troika. Top-down agreements have little chance of working unless they are complemented by harmonious and right relationships built from the bottom upwards. This is a lesson we should draw from Northern Ireland and Bosnia. I trust it is equally applicable in the Middle East and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000038"></a><b><a name="61205-0009.htm_spnew77"></a><a name="06120586000064"></a>Lord Dahrendorf:</b> My Lords, many speakers in this debate have referred to the key role of the Israel-Palestine issue for the future of the Middle East. I do not disagree with them, though one is bound to wonder whether the existence of an independent state of Palestine would have prevented the Iraq War or would have contributed to the solution of the present predicament. Having said that, I turn to an issue which might appear marginal in the context of a Middle East debate, but of which I shall try to argue that it is anything but marginal; that is, Turkey.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000039"></a>The Iraq War has had a whole series of clearly unintended consequences. It has, for example, enhanced the role of Iran both in the region and more generally in an unexpected way. It has exacerbated the conflict between Sunnis and Shias. It has exacerbated the Israel-Palestine conflict. It has unfortunately led to quite deep divisions between the United States and Europe; and&#151;let us make no bones about it&#151;they are quite profound at this stage. But above all, it has led to a massive radicalisation of Islamic politics. That is true in the region but it is in some ways true all over the world. One of the big questions with which we are faced is how this general radicalisation of Islamic politics can be, if not stopped, at least controlled and gradually changed.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000040"></a>That will not happen in Iraq. I was one of those who initially supported the war, but in my view damage limitation is now almost the only option there. It is not likely to happen in Afghanistan where, as I see it, we are likely to see for a long time at best a precarious balance of warlords and drug mafia and, one hopes, a growing number of groups, of forces and above all of individuals who are looking for a life in freedom.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000041"></a>It is crucial that the regimes&#151;the Governments whom the Minister in his introductory speech called &#147;moderate and democratic&#148;&#151;are strengthened and are certainly not further weakened. A lot of weakening has happened. &#147;Moderate and democratic&#148; has become quite a strange combination of words because &#147;democratic&#148; for all of us means elections, and elections in these states may in fact have strengthened the radicalisation of Islamic politics. In other words, we cannot argue that elections are the solution to the  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>problem of the radicalisation of Islamic politics&#151;and that holds in Egypt as it does in Afghanistan and in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000042"></a>To come back to my main point, I think we have to be deeply concerned about the future of moderate Islamic Governments, wherever they are, and should do everything we can to strengthen their hand rather than weaken it. And this is where Turkey comes into the picture&#151;in my view in a crucial place because, if you will pardon my saying so, in Iraq, despite the presence of troops, we can do relatively little. In Afghanistan much of what we do is hope. But in the case of Turkey, there are things which we can do, and we can do them now and in the immediate future. And the terrible thing is that at precisely this time, we in Europe are doing the wrong things in our relations with Turkey. The country is sliding away from the West.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000043"></a>Next year will be an election year in Turkey; 2007 is a crucial election year. In the late spring&#151;the date has not yet been fixed&#151;there will be presidential elections. In the late autumn&#151;in October or November&#151;there will be parliamentary elections. We may well see the results of a situation which has been created not least by the obvious awkwardness, to put it mildly, in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey. In my view it is highly risky, indeed politically totally wrong, to stop or even stall the negotiations with Turkey at this point. I do not want to be misunderstood. It is clear that when Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, the issue of Cyprus will have to have been resolved. I see no reason why it should be resolved this year in these weeks with a set date at this point. It is quite clear that the Copenhagen criteria will have to be applied to Turkey in full but I see no reason why we should now say that they probably will not be and therefore the bona fide negotiations with a view to full membership of Turkey in the European Union should be stalled. We have to continue to negotiate with the intention of full membership and we have to do that here and now.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000044"></a>This means&#151;this is my main point&#151;that we have to support the commissioner who negotiates in the light of the Council decisions of objectives and method. I implore Her Majesty&#146;s Government to insist in Council meetings that the statements made by both German and French Government representatives these days have to stop. When one is in the middle of a negotiation, one does not attack the other side in this way, or suggest that one does not want a successful outcome of these negotiations. I worry about the fact that on this very day, the German Chancellor, the French President and the Polish Prime Minister have their routine meetings in which the German Chancellor proposes a formal decision by the Council of Ministers to introduce a clause into the negotiating mandate for Turkey which will make it necessary to have another unanimous decision to continue at a later date. I very much hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will take not only the line which they have taken in any case, but a very strong line and that they will argue not only in the terms in which the Turkish issue is often argued but in the wider terms that are the subject of this debate.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000045"></a>Once again, I hope that noble Lords will not regard this as a distraction. Turkey is a moderate Islamic country that is well on the way to democracy as we use the term; above all, it is well on the way towards the separation of religion and law and therefore a country that needs and deserves support. It should be an example for other moderate Islamic countries around the whole region that is our subject in this important and useful debate.</p>
<h5><a name="06120586000060"></a>7.20 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120586000046"></a><b><a name="61205-0010.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="06120586000065"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, at this stage of the debate much has been said by noble Lords far better qualified than me, but I have some observations. First, the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, talked about the unintended consequences of the invasion of Iraq; I have another. I served in Headquarters 1 (UK) Armoured Division in Iraq in March 2003. At all levels, we honestly believed that we faced a threat from chemical or biological weapons. Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear that we were not deterred; we had countermeasures, training and brilliant leadership. What does that tell the rest of the world? Very simply, it says that US/UK forces will not be deterred by the threat of chemical or biological weapons. Since very few non-nuclear states can resist a conventional attack by US/UK forces through the use of conventional weapons alone, the only way a state can acquire an ultimate guarantee of security&#151;to use the language of yesterday&#146;s Statement on Trident&#151;is to have some form of nuclear weapon, even without an effective missile-delivery system. Little wonder, therefore, that Iran actively seeks nuclear weapons. The fact that our invasion of Iraq was of questionable legality and necessity does not help.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000047"></a>My second point is that many noble Lords are concerned about military overstretch. Your Lordships have worried about tour intervals for at least a decade, but I shall add a little more detail than even the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, gave us. Some time ago I asked the then Defence Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for how many years we had operated outside defence planning assumptions. He erroneously answered, &#147;None&#148;. A suitable letter was sent to me and placed in the Library, adding more detail, as its introduction put it. The fact is that we have operated outside the DPAs for many years. That should keep alarm bells ringing in Defence Ministers&#146; offices continuously.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000048"></a>The Government have also quietly reduced our capability under defence planning assumptions. We are now able to conduct either two small-scale enduring operations or one medium-scale enduring operation; &#147;medium-scale&#148; means a brigade. Alternately, we can make one large-scale intervention&#151;&#147;intervention&#148; implies a short timescale, about six months&#151;and follow it with a medium-scale sustaining operation. So what are we currently doing? The answer is two medium-scale-plus operations&#151;Operation TELIC in Iraq and Operation Herrick in Afghanistan&#151;in addition to several minor operations.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000049"></a>As we know, both operations are very challenging&#151;we have talked about the problems  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>today, so I shall not repeat them&#151;but what is the effect? It is not just the problem of the tour interval alone&#151;the pressure on the serviceman&#151;that noble Lords have talked about. The problem is lack of training. Yes, there is good training for the current operations, but we are not training enough for the ability to prosecute a high-intensity operation at the large scale of effort. We are building into our Regular Army and other Armed Forces a weakness because, in time, officers at all levels will have missed out on vital training experience. I think that many noble Lords were surprised at the weakness exposed in the Israel Defense Forces recently. The military costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may be far higher than realised, because they are hidden. Worse still, no amount of extra resources later will be able to replace that loss of training and experience. It will be built into our Armed Forces for years to come.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000050"></a>My third observation concerns Iraq and Afghanistan. The outlook for Iraq is bleak; I have not heard any serious commentator suggest anything else. It is important to recognise that, in both campaigns, the media consistently exaggerate the difficulties and minimise the successes, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. I cannot recently recall reading anything positive about either campaign, and it is ridiculous to suggest that successes do not occur regularly. It is not a failing on the part of Ministers and officials. Good news stories are available; however, the media choose not to publish them. That is extremely frustrating for those officers responsible. But intriguingly in respect of Afghanistan, when many senior officers privately brief me, they are confident of the outcome. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, gave us a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000051"></a>Many noble Lords have referred to the general reluctance of NATO nations to contribute troops to operations in Afghanistan. I agree with their sentiments; it is extremely disappointing and a major challenge for NATO. However, the telling point from one senior officer was that they would jump on the bandwagon later when the operation came right, or words to that effect. I hope to see that situation obtain in due course.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000052"></a>There has been much talk about the legitimate economy for Afghanistan&#151;my noble friend Lord Eccles talked about the need to get Afghanistan into the global economy&#151;but I have yet to hear what Afghan farmers are expected to produce as an alternative to narcotics in the short term. In the longer term the education programme, especially education for women, as outlined by the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, must be the right approach. But what can be legitimately exported from Afghanistan to sustain that country, and how?</p>

<p><a name="06120586000053"></a>Transport from Afghanistan to the market, especially in the developed world, is expensive, tortuous and insecure. Even NATO containers going to our operations in Afghanistan are mysteriously raided. Can anything be done to minimise or reduce transport costs for the Afghan economy? If the Minister cannot answer that now, perhaps he could write to me later. At present, the transport system and  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economy favour high-value, low-volume, low-inherent-skill products. Opium, say at &#163;100 a kilo, is ideal. I wonder what the effect would be of putting in place a subsidised, reliable and secure transport system to the European markets, perhaps a very regular Antonov flight at very low cost. In the long term, what is being considered for reliable road and rail links to a sea port from Afghanistan? I know that it is a long way and that it would have to go through other countries, but it would go some way to meet the concerns outlined by my noble friend Lord Eccles about developing the Afghan economy. If nothing is done about transport links for goods, it is hard to see how the Afghan per capita income can be increased.</p>

<p><a name="06120586000054"></a>The invasion of Iraq has encouraged the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The media, while correctly identifying problems, would be much more responsible if they covered some military and civilian successes in theatre. However, my greatest concern is the permanent damage to our Armed Forces due to operating far outside the defence planning assumptions.</p>
<h5><a name="06120591000033"></a>7.29 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120591000001"></a><b><a name="61205-0010.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06120591000035"></a>Lord Skidelsky:</b> My Lords, I would like to concentrate on the Middle East aspect, rather than on the Afghan aspect, of this debate. Two days ago, the outgoing UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, described the Iraqi situation not as being on the verge of civil war, which is the current euphemism, but &#147;much worse&#148; than civil war, with ordinary life being more dangerous than it had been under Saddam Hussein. The Secretary-General of the United Nations and not the media said that.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000002"></a>It is an appalling sign that such obvious home truths can only be uttered by a public official about to leave office. The Iraqi economy is in ruins. Oil production, at 2.1 billion barrels per day, has not yet recovered its Saddam level after three years. According to calculations in the 21 October issue of the <I>Lancet</I>, an estimated 655,000 people have lost their lives since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, 600,000 of those through violence. In the Shia areas of southern Iraq, fundamentalist Islam has seized control and imposed the dictatorship of Sharia law&#151;a far cry from the neo-con project of turning Iraq into a western-style democracy.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000003"></a>Advance leaks from the Iraq Study Group&#151;the so-called Baker panel set up by President Bush after mid-term elections&#151;suggest that it will recommend a phased withdrawal of US forces, and a transfer of security functions to the Iraqi Government. Short of doubling or trebling the size of American forces, that is the minimum concession to reality; but what chance is there of the Iraqi Government regaining control with the coalition having destroyed the Iraqi Army and Civil Service?</p>

<p><a name="06120591000004"></a>Somewhat more promising is the grudging recognition that in order to achieve peace in Iraq, and more generally in the Middle East, we will have to engage the other regional powers, especially Iran and Syria. A report co-authored in 2004 by Robert Gates, the new American Secretary of Defense, advocated  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;selectively engaging&#148; with Iran in order to promote &#147;regional stability&#148;. I hope that he will carry that determination with him into his new office.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000005"></a>The Prime Minister, in his Mansion House speech of 13 November, acknowledged that a settlement in Iraq required &#147;partnership&#148; with Iran and Syria as well as a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Prime Minister of Israel has also been talking in a similar vein. On the other side of the divide, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, exploiting Iran's new position as a regional power broker, held a summit with the presidents of Syria and Iraq in Teheran on 27 November to discuss ways to bring peace to Iraq. If a way could be found to link up these western, Israeli and Syrian-Iran initiatives, the door would be prized open for that &#147;whole Middle East strategy&#148;, of which the Prime Minister has talked.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000006"></a>Let us be clear though about what this agonising reappraisal means. It means accepting that the American-British-Israeli policy of reshaping the Middle East by military force has failed. The Americans have lacked the strength and will to subdue Iraq, much less create a democracy there; the Israelis have failed to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon, or indeed to quell the Palestinian insurgency; and America has failed to stop Iran&#146;s uranium enrichment programme. These policy reversals have knocked on the head the myth of American omnipotence. The emperor has been shown to have no clothes, or at least no clothes cut to carry out the policies he has embarked on. The United States is still the most important act in the Middle East, but it is not all-powerful. The Islamic revival has created a balance of power in the region for the first time since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. That means that any settlement of the interlocking problems of the Middle East will have to be a negotiated one.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000007"></a>I am not sure that Bush and Blair yet realise this. The reality of failure has dissolved part of the fog that envelopes their deceptive and self-deceiving utterances, but the two leaders still apparently believe that the game is theirs provided only that Iran and Syria, and the forces they control, can be co-opted as partners in their design. The clearest indication of this continuing delusion is their insistence on attaching preconditions to any talks with the other side: Iran must give up its nuclear ambitions; Syria and Iran must renounce support for violence; and the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority must renounce terrorism as well as recognising Israel&#146;s &#147;right to exist&#148;. These conditions for talks are completely unrealistic.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000008"></a>The reality is that the renunciations which the west rightly seeks can only come about as part of the bargain eventually struck, not as preconditions for talks. I doubt if Bush, Blair and Prime Minister Olmert have yet accepted the need for a genuinely negotiated agreement of outstanding Middle Eastern problems; but that is the price they will have to pay for the failure of their policies. The fact that a balance of power has come into being in the Middle East is precisely what makes possible a genuine negotiation, leading to multilateral ownership of a regional peace settlement.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000009"></a>An opportunity now exists to strike what I have called a &#147;grand bargain&#148;, to pacify the most dangerous and volatile area of the world&#151;a bargain  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1127"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to which all the great powers and the state and the non-state power holders in or adjoining the Middle East might be induced to underwrite. That includes Hezbollah. Here I differ a little from what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said on Lebanon. Of course the long agony of Lebanon is a tragedy, but it is basically an outcome&#151;and it has been going on since the late 1960s&#151;of events outside Lebanon, and particularly of the Israel-Palestinian dispute. Lebanon has been a victim, not the centre of the storm.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000010"></a>To give the Prime Minister credit, he glimpses the opportunity for a &#147;grand design&#148;, but he is too much hostage to his own past mistakes and to the American president to act resolutely on it. I would add that he has missed the chance to put the weight of Europe behind British diplomacy. He has sacrificed everything to the &#147;special relationship&#148; with the United States, from which Britain has got nothing but grief in the recent period&#151;as Kendall Myers, a senior US State Department official was tactless enough to point out only the other day.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000011"></a>The outlines of a &#147;grand bargain&#148; are not difficult to discern, difficult though they will be to achieve. Other noble Lords have touched on various elements. They include an agreed formula for sharing power and oil revenues between the three main provinces in a federalised Iraq; a fully independent Palestinian state, roughly within the 1967 borders, with international guarantees of Israel&#146;s security, and, I would add, an internationally patrolled demilitarised zone along Israel's borders; a phased withdrawal of western forces from the Middle East in return for a guarantee against the use of oil for political purposes; and a nuclear-free zone&#151;something alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Howell&#151;without which Iran will never give up its nuclear ambitions. One has just to bite the bullet that Israel in return will give up its bomb. Finally, a reactivation of the suspended customs union between Israel and Palestine, agreed to in the Oslo accords, with a gradual extension to Jordan and Lebanon creating a genuine free-trade area that is capable of reviving the economies of that region, with a &#147;Marshall Aid&#148; programme to get it started, as happened in Europe in 1948.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000012"></a>What is the alternative? I do not believe that a &#147;one step at a time&#148; approach will work. Every small confidence-building step in one area will be sabotaged by a renewed outbreak of violence somewhere else. That has been happening. The time has passed when the United States or Israel could pick off their opponents one by one. The Islamic world is more cohesive and angrier than it was nearly 30 years ago when Egypt settled with Israel. We must never forget that that settlement cost Anwar Sadat his life.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000013"></a>We should never forget that the Muslim population of western and central Europe now approaches 10 per cent of the total population. What prospect is there for harmonious race relations in Europe with the Middle East in flames? The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, rightly touched on the Turkish aspect of that estrangement in his thought-provoking speech.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000014"></a>If we miss the chance to do something big and constructive now, we may not get another for a long time. The balance of power in the Middle East is

If that process continues without a comprehensive settlement, vengeance, I fear, will not limp.</p>
<h5><a name="06120591000034"></a>7.41 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120591000015"></a><b><a name="61205-0010.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06120591000036"></a>Lord Luce:</b> My Lords, this debate has, naturally and rightly, been absorbed by today&#146;s many crises that we face in the Middle East. We have more or less agreed that we are possibly on the verge of a turning point&#151;another turning point, because during the past 50 years we have faced numerous ones.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000016"></a>In the past few years, I have not been able to take a day-to-day interest in the Middle East because I have been preoccupied with other jobs. However, from the age of 10, I was out in the Middle East a great deal, for my father had a lifetime there and, at the end of his days, he was appointed as the special envoy of the Foreign Secretary to negotiate our withdrawal from the Middle East during 1970-71. Later, I was privileged enough to serve as a Minister of State in the 1980s with responsibilities for the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000017"></a>I hope that the House will bear with me if I focus on just two things. First, I should like to take a step back and reflect for a moment on what considerations should govern our approach to the Middle East. Secondly, I should like to focus briefly on one aspect where I think that Britain can be constructive, especially in the Gulf: that is, on political reform.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000018"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves that it is less than a hundred years since the foundation of the modern Middle East was laid in the immediate post-First World War days leading up to 1922&#151;largely imposed by Britain and France, for good or for ill&#151;the Arab world having just emerged from 500 years of occupation in the Ottoman Empire, with all the inevitable wounds that that created. In Europe, it has taken us centuries to develop our nation states and current systems of government.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000019"></a>It is also worth reminding ourselves that the Arab world had a great empire which started 13 centuries ago and flourished from the borders of China right across the Mediterranean, with quite a legacy in various parts of the world, such as Spain. More recently, we, too, have had our empire and have left good things and not such good things. One of the most interesting observations about empires is that in the period after they are over, countries suffer from a lack of self-confidence and some decline. Those symptoms exist in the Arab world and have done so for some time. There are certainly symptoms of lack of self-confidence in Britain today: the decline in faith; the decline in values. So any approach that we make to the Middle East should be with the utmost humility.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000020"></a>It is against that background that we have today explored the explosive factors that exist in the Middle East: the failure to resolve the Palestine-Israel issue; the desperation in Iraq; the uncertainty in Lebanon; and the exasperation at the failure of the United Nations to implement many of the important Security Council resolutions, ranging from the resolutions that demanded that Israel end illegal settlements in occupied territories to the need to disarm Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1129"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120591000021"></a>As a result of all that, many people live today in what one can only describe as a Dante's <I>Inferno</I>. The graphic descriptions that we have heard today in outstanding speeches have depicted that. As we all know, desperate people do desperate things. In that situation of desperation, the hardline states, such as Iran and Syria, are encouraged still further.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000022"></a>I agree with all the speakers today who, in looking at the way forward, have said that it can come only from a twin approach: the will on the part of the countries of the Middle East to find a resolution; and with help, such as we can give it, from the West&#151;Europe and the United States. It is of mutual interest to try to help them create stability. As we all agree, that needs a persistent international effort to help strengthen the moderates in that area and isolate the extremists. Whether we like it or not, it needs the help of the United States. We need to be reminded of Churchill's remark that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120591000030"></a>&#147;The United States invariably does the right thing, having exhausted every other alternative&#148;.</ul><a name="06120591000027"></a>I just hope that they have now exhausted every other alternative.
<p><a name="06120591000023"></a>I ought now to be nice about the United States. Condoleezza Rice has not made the mistake that John Foster Dulles once made when he was Secretary of State. He landed in the Middle East and said:</p>
<ul><a name="06120591000031"></a>&#147;Now let us resolve these problems in a truly Christian fashion&#148;.</ul><a name="06120591000028"></a>But we also need Europe, with her long historic connections with that area. Above all, I agree with all those, including my noble friend Lord Hannay, who say that there must be a regional solution. Arab neighbours must play an active part in all this. It is worth reminding ourselves that in 1961, a Kuwait crisis existed when General Kassem threatened to invade Kuwait. The British moved in, but very quickly afterwards an Arab peacekeeping force took our place. Although there are no direct analogies, it is worth reminding ourselves of that lesson. We must go on working vigorously for a just solution and strengthen the dialogue between the West and the Arab world, based on mutual respect for each other's history, culture and religion.
<p><a name="06120591000024"></a>I shall say just a word about political reform, especially in the Gulf, because that is where we can be most constructive. In the speech, which has already been referred to, made by Condoleezza Rice in Cairo in the summer, she said:</p>
<ul><a name="06120591000032"></a>&#147;For 60 years, the United States has pursued stability at the expense of democracy in the Middle East and has achieved neither&#148;.</ul><a name="06120591000029"></a>To my mind, that rather implies that democracy is unstable. Surely, the right political reform can in fact strengthen stability and they do not contradict each other.

<p><a name="06120591000025"></a>At this point, I declare an interest. I am patron of the Sir William Luce Memorial Fund, which is based in Durham University and is working with the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies there and Chatham House, with the support of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and of the Gulf states, on a project jointly to study political reform in the Gulf.  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1130"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There are certain considerations that we ought to take into account. That reform must be home-grown. It must stem from the roots of the Gulf states, the Arab states, themselves.</p>

<p><a name="06120591000026"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves that, whereas in our empire we imposed the only system that we knew, understood and respected&#151;our own system of parliamentary democracy&#151;we did not do so in the Gulf because our responsibilities were for the protection of the external affairs of the Gulf and their defence, not their internal affairs. Those Gulf states can evolve their own system quite naturally, and we need to accept that they have a different culture, a different history, different traditions, and a different religion from ours. In the past, their tribes, clans and families have been the dominating factor, and their Majlis al-Shura system has given the people of those countries access to their rulers. But circumstances are changing. Elites&#151;middle classes&#151;are emerging in these areas. Modern travel and communication strengthen them, and there is also a very large foreign population in the Gulf states to help influence them. We can therefore welcome some of the changes: municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, Parliaments in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, the development of an al-Shura assembly in the Oman, recent elections in the Yemen, and elections shortly to be held in the UAE.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000001"></a>In the elections in Palestine, it was encouraging to see that 63 per cent of the electorate wanted to vote. In Iraq, a high proportion of people wanted to vote, but they must have the right circumstances in which to allow democracy of one kind or another to flourish. We should therefore share our experiences with these countries. We should not impose ourselves on them or lecture them on what system they should have. Nor should we undermine the rulers of those countries in that process. Against the background of a decline in trust in politics and in Parliament here, and our doubts about a second Chamber and what its future should be, I rather doubt that we are in a good position to lecture them.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000002"></a>The other aspect that has been touched on today is that we must meet the challenge that extremists&#151;Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt&#151;will get elected, and have been elected, to these assemblies. I am reminded of a conversation that is alleged to have taken place between Nehru and Nasser, when Nasser boasted to Nehru, &#147;I put my extremists in prison. What do you do with yours?&#148;. Nehru is alleged to have replied, &#147;Actually, I put mine in Parliament&#148;. There is something to be said for arguing by these means rather than fighting.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000003"></a>Each state needs to develop its own system of accountability to suit its own circumstances. Above all, we need to encourage evolution rather than revolution. However long and drawn out the crisis of the Middle East has been, and is, we must persevere with our moderate friends to find a way forward that will bring peace as opposed to war in the Middle East.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who was one of the few to talk consistent sense in the weeks before the opening hostilities in Iraq. The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, as many of us in the Chamber will remember, constantly urged Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the United States Government to squeeze the regime of Saddam Hussein by imposing heavier and heavier sanctions, not by attacking him. Those speeches recall, to those who know anything of recent history, the wise letters which President Eisenhower wrote to Sir Anthony Eden at the time of Suez. They were published as an appendix to volume II of Eisenhower&#146;s memoirs, <I>Waging Peace</I>. Perhaps it will turn out that President Chirac was writing similar letters to Prime Minister Blair in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000005"></a>Many of us share the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, to avoid war, but, for all sorts of reasons&#151;some naïve, some complicated&#151;many of us foolishly believed Her Majesty&#146;s Government when they assured us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. We also accepted some of the fascinating stories that leaked out that there had been secret dealings between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Of course we did not expect to be told the details at the time; we merely accepted Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s word.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000006"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has said, the problems of Afghanistan and of the Middle East&#151;historians among us will remember that the Middle East used to be known as the Near East; no one quite knows why there was that sudden change from Near to Middle&#151;are quite separate, even if they are interconnected. Her Majesty&#146;s Government share a mission in Afghanistan with the other NATO countries, however inadequately our allies may respond. So far as I know, there is no serious opposition to the NATO commitment, even among countries, such as Spain, that are generally opposed to United States policies and to President Bush. That is because all can see that if the Taliban were allowed to resume its control of the country, or even part of it, we should have a good deal more than poppy growing to complain about. We can assume that, were we to accept defeat at the hands of the Taliban, al-Qaeda would soon be back at home base. It is therefore hard to see that Britain&#151;a responsible country, even if very far from Kabul&#151;can have any attitude for the foreseeable future other than to remain. The Minister, with his statistics on new wells and the number of girls now in schools, encouraged us to think that the mission might one day be able to be fulfilled; but how far ahead is that likely to be?</p>

<p><a name="06120599000007"></a>As to poppies, we should not forget how, in the course of another, successful, ethical foreign policy&#151;the abolition of the slave trade&#151;this country persuaded its slave traders to change almost overnight from the purchase and sale of slaves to the purchase and sale of palm oil.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000008"></a>Support for the NATO position in Afghanistan does not mean that we have to accept all the arrangements that were made by the United States at an early stage in the war against the Taliban, particularly the establishment of the prison at Guantanamo, which must be one of our great ally&#146;s worst ever actions. If President Theodore Roosevelt,

<p><a name="06120599000009"></a>Earlier in the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, called Afghanistan more a collection of tribes than a state. That may be so, but it is an ancient community, with a complicated and interesting history in which Britain has been much involved. Was there not a time in the 1760s when an Afghan empire extended not only over eastern Persia but over Baluchistan, the Punjab and parts of Kashmir?</p>

<p><a name="06120599000010"></a>Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq is a very modern country indeed, having been cobbled together in the aftermath of the First World War, as the noble Lord, Lord Luce, recalled, by a distinguished academic, Dr Gertrude Bell; by an outstanding soldier/administrator, Sir Percy Cox; and by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr Winston Churchill. Before 1919, the three former Turkish provinces of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra constituted the area that is now Iraq. That still has a consequence for modern politics. The country, as most noble Lords will know, was a British mandate from 1920 to 1927, and Sir Percy Cox, whom I have just mentioned, was our first High Commissioner. He was the man who drew the straight lines that have characterised the Iraqi frontiers ever since, and who the <I>Dictionary of National Biography</I> recalls as having revised and amplified the Turkish administrative system with rare skill, a commendation that might have been read with benefit by the early United States administrators in Iraq after the conquest, such as General Garner and Mr Brennan.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000011"></a>Until 1957, Iraq remained an informal part of the British Empire. This country had no greater friend in the Middle East than the longstanding Prime Minister Nuri es-Said and King Faisal of Iraq, was tutored by a distinguished English social anthropologist in his youth, a friend of mine, Julian Pitt-Rivers. After 1957 in Iraq there was a dictatorship, first of the army and then of a political party, the Socialist Nationalists of the Ba&#146;ath party. Despite that bizarre and unsuccessful history the Iraqis nevertheless&#151;this is something that strikes one whenever one meets someone from that country&#151;quickly developed a sense of patriotism and of what a nation should be. Perhaps that was assisted by the fact that the territory of Iraq has a very grand place in history. It is after all, the birthplace of civilisation, of law and of writing. Unlike some new countries, such as Ghana, Iraq did not have to invent a past, for the past in Iraq was always there between the Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000012"></a>In 2003 as we all know, the United States decided to invent a new stage in the history of Iraq, by establishing a sun of democracy there which it was hoped would radiate throughout the region. One United States neo-conservative spoke of a &#147;tsunami of democracy&#148; sweeping throughout the Middle East. That policy was not directly reflected in the speeches justifying the war itself. Instead, the pretext&#151;that was the word used by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr Wolfowitz&#151;was the nuclear weapons allegedly possessed by Saddam Hussein. It would have been far  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1133"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>preferable, as I am sure noble Lords would agree, if Britain and the United States had been completely honest in 2003 and announced that their plan was indeed regime change&#151;getting rid of a regime of brutal wrongdoing. The United States at least could have remembered those words as they figure in the at-one-time famous Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine of 1905, which specifically justified US intervention in foreign countries in Latin America if &#147;brutal wrongdoing&#148; was proved.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000013"></a>From listening to several speeches in the House in this debate, I have the sense that some noble Lords&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, for example, and the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs&#151;might have supported such a policy of intervention if brutal wrongdoing was plainly written down. As we all know, the military operation in Iraq was brilliant. It is right to give credit where credit is due, but as the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, said, no one seems to have taken any trouble to consider what would happen after the victory. Someone else&#151;I think it was the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby&#151;wondered where the British planners were at that time: why did they not consider the future? Alas, there was no Sir Percy Cox able to reconstruct the former Administration &#147;with rare skill&#148; and&#151;again alas&#151;the emblematic sight of post-war Iraq was not the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#146;s statue in Baghdad but the sight of American troops standing by while great museums were being looted.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000014"></a>Now the case is everywhere being put frequently for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, even&#151;most unusually&#151;by our leading soldier. But even those who questioned the desirability of the war at the beginning, such as me, must now wonder whether a serious withdrawal is possible if the alternative in Iraq could be what the Chief of Staff to the United States President, Josh Bolten&#151;not Ambassador Bolton but Josh&#151;described recently as,</p>
<ul><a name="06120599000024"></a>&#147;a failed state, a haven for terrorism, a real threat to the United States and the region&#148;,</ul><a name="06120599000023"></a>and of course the United States&#146; allies. That, for once, is a realistic statement by an American neo-conservative. 
<p><a name="06120599000015"></a>So the odds are that we have no alternative but to stay. One distinguished Member of this House, the late Lord Harlech, is credited with telling President Kennedy in 1963 in respect of a Central American civil war, &#147;Every country, you know, Mr President, has a right to its own Wars of the Roses&#148;, but all civil wars have unforeseen consequences, even more than all wars. However desirable it must be, I cannot see that a British-US role in Iraq can be abandoned once it has been begun. Before we seriously contemplate any withdrawal, we should consider much more seriously the future politics of the country and in particular whether the place of the three Iraqi provinces that I mentioned earlier as existing under the Ottoman Empire&#151;Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra&#151;might be re-examined to give historical backing to a real federal state with a balance between the Kurds, the Sunni and the Shia.</p>

The great successes in recent years in history has been the federations such as those in the United States but also those in Germany, Australia, Canada, and&#151;without the use of the actual word&#151;in Spain. A solution along those lines has begun to be mentioned to the United States following the thoughtful writing on those questions by Ambassador Peter Galbraith; and the noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to it in his speech.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000017"></a>My noble friend Lord Hannay opposed the idea of any break up of Iraq into three separate entities, but that is not what I am suggesting. All the same, I recall, as my last reflection, that Churchill at the Cairo conference in 1920 as Colonial Secretary instinctively favoured the creation of an autonomous Kurdistan as a buffer zone between the new Turkey and the new Iraq. I suspect that Churchill&#146;s instinct, as so often, was right, even when he knew far less than the experts such as Sir Percy Cox.</p>
<h5><a name="06120599000026"></a>8.08 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120599000018"></a><b><a name="06120599000028"></a>The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford:</b> My Lords, I put my name down to speak. I was told that it got lost somewhere in the system, so I hope that your Lordships will forgive me for a few remarks in the gap. I want to say two things that are fairly raw, given the time available to me. First, I am increasingly concerned about the use of the phrase &#147;the war on terror&#148; as a major theme for directing our policy in the Middle East. I have an increasing sense that the real change that has happened in foreign policy is the end of the Cold War, and that is what we are adjusting to and we need to get it right. There is an interesting article in the latest &#147;New York Review of Books&#148;, which I hope appears in the Library, reviewing a book by Louise Richardson, who is a professor at Harvard. The book is called, <I>What Terrorists Want: Understanding the Enemy, Containing the Threat</I>. It has some sober things to say to us on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000019"></a>The trouble with conducting policy under the theme &#147;a war on terror&#148; is that it invites reaction: the sort of reaction that creates chaos and disorder and continued violence. Who would say in Iraq that that is not where we are at the moment? My first point is, can we shift away in the construction of the policy from that as a major theme? Why do we not work on the business of diversity and difference? Why do we not work to our strengths? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Luce, about the importance of maintaining our international relationships in all of this. Whatever we think of the Bush policy, the relationship of this country with the United States, with Europe, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, with China, with India and across the world has huge potential for exercising influence in the Middle East. We are a prosperous country. We are struggling, reasonably successfully, with being a multicultural society. Why are these not being used as strengths in a diplomatic route into these matters. That is my first point.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000020"></a>As to my second point, I am even more concerned that a policy of a war on terror has led to military  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1135"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>action. The comments of the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, about the retreat of Israel from the Lebanon in 2000 were very interesting. Of course, what Israel left behind was Hezbollah even stronger than when it went in. Military action can be counter-productive; it can end up in exactly the opposite place to where it started. We sent our troops into Northern Ireland in 1969, where they were hugely greeted by the Catholic and nationalist populations. Two years later bombs and stones were being thrown at them and so on. We went into Iraq in April 2003. Six months later, more than 60 per cent of the population thought it right to attack the troops who had gone in.</p>

<p><a name="06120599000021"></a>To use military action as a route into sorting out these problems is deeply dangerous and counter-productive. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that we will have to reconstruct the diplomatic tasks that the Foreign Office has traditionally done so well in the past. There is a huge task in front of us if we are to get out of this mess.</p>
<h5><a name="061205101000081"></a>8.11 pm</h5>
<p><a name="061205101000002"></a><b><a name="61205-0011.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="061205101000084"></a>Lord Garden:</b> My Lords, despite it being only a fortnight since we discussed many of these issues after the gracious Speech, things have happened internationally in the mean time, and the contributions that we have heard throughout the debate today have all been important and have added to the information that we had before.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000003"></a>The central issues are not surprising. We have talked predominantly about Israel-Palestine, Israel-Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan and how we can develop the relationships with Iran and Syria. The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, brought an important dimension to the debate that had not been picked up elsewhere&#151;the question of Turkey. From these Benches, I support every word that he said. It surprised me that there has been no mention of the possibility of conflict in Iran, of the possibility of either US or Israeli action against Iran, or of the way in which Saudi-Iranian relations are going.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000004"></a>Most noble Lords made the point that all the problems are interconnected. Although the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, chose to separate them, I think that at the end he put them back together again. Certainly there is an interconnection between these problems, which cover a large geographical area. It is also an area full of natural resources, although we have not spoken a great deal about the wealth that is available but is so unevenly distributed. As King Abdullah of Jordan told us on 7 November, we do not have much time. He talked about there being a matter of months left in which to make progress. There is a real problem, in that the international community does not seem to be able to focus on more than one crisis at a time, yet things are moving in all these areas, as we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000005"></a>Like other noble Lords, I shall start with Iraq, particularly because it is an area in which we have a significant commitment. We also, as many noble Lords have said, have a deep responsibility there because we had a hand in causing the current situation and because of the levels of deaths and violence, the exodus of people and the lack of a clear strategy. We heard from the Minister today that  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1136"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>things are relatively calm in all but four areas. We heard a similarly complacent introduction from the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, on 20 November. The problems in Iraq are extraordinary. The bucolic pictures of progress that we hear from Ministers are impossible to reconcile with the reality. There were reports in a newspaper this weekend of a policy of murdering patients in hospitals if they belonged to the wrong group.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000006"></a>My noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby referred to the problems of reconstruction. We know that electricity is still available only for a few hours a day in much of the country. We know of the fleeing of tens of thousands of professionals out of the country. The Minister told us the figures for how many people had gone back into Afghanistan; he did not tell us the figures for how many people are leaving Iraq. We have asked repeatedly over the past three years for objective data to be published on a regular basis so that we can see where there is progress and where there is a lack of progress, so that we can put the resources in the right place. There is no hope of a successful political development in Iraq if the Iraqi Government cannot, in the end, deliver any improvements in the day-to-day lives of their people.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000007"></a>I would love to have the time to debate with the noble Lord, Lord Soley, the appropriate ways in which interventions should be carried out. It is a complex issue, two aspects of which relate to how many allies you have with you and what chance you have of a successful outcome. I would say to those who supported the intervention into Iraq, which includes my noble friend Lord Jacobs, that they should do what I do and look every morning at the website www.dailywarnews.blogspot.com. This website collates media reports from Iraq of events over the past 24 hours. It is always sombre reading. The Saturday report included 91 killed and 43 injured in a triple car bomb attack in central Baghdad; an American soldier killed in Anbar province; three killed and seven wounded at a police checkpoint at a west Baghdad hospital; an interior ministry official gunned down in the east of the capital; two killed by a Katyusha rocket attack; and a soft drinks delivery driver and his colleague shot&#151;and that is only the Baghdad section. It finishes with just one sentence:</p>
<ul><a name="061205101000077"></a>&#147;Police said they found 44 bodies in different parts of Baghdad&#148;.</ul><a name="061205101000072"></a>Lest noble Lords should think that I picked a particularly bad day, I rechecked the website this morning. Yesterday&#146;s report has a similar sentence stating that the figure for yesterday was 50 bodies in Baghdad. I shall not weary your Lordships with the continuing litany of death and destruction for the other provinces, although the website gives the figures province by province, not only for the four provinces. I added it up to 196 dead reported in the Iraqi media in that 24-hour period. There were hardly any reports, of course, in our own media. We have grown bored of reading about the terror that we have brought to the Iraqi people.
<p><a name="061205101000008"></a>We have heard many views today on what to do. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, reminded us, we hang on expecting Baker-Hamilton to pull a rabbit out of the hat tomorrow. We have also learnt  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1137"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that on 6 November Mr Rumsfeld was writing his memo of 21 proposals of how to cut and run without appearing to do so. Despite the Minister&#146;s protestations, we know that the British Government have no influence on this US debate on strategy and as usual we must wait to find out what the US intends to do. I trust that we in this country will not have to wait too long to have a full investigation into the way we have handled Iraq. There are lessons to be learnt at every stage&#151;from when we went in, to how we conducted the war, to what has happened subsequently. Those are lessons that we may need to apply if we come back to other interventions later.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000009"></a>Noble Lords have agreed that partition would be bad for Iraq, yet the endgame has not yet been played out. We have taken comfort from the apparent stability in the Kurdish northern region, yet there are worrying reports of growing tensions even there. Perhaps the Minister in his winding-up speech could share with us his assessment of developments in the north of Iraq. The battle for the central region including Baghdad seems to be being lost if the level of violence is the indicator. Even in the south, which is of direct interest to us in the UK as our forces are there, divisions are appearing between the Shia groups, and the role of Iran is of great concern. Add to all that this talk of Saudi Arabia readying itself to take side against Iranian-backed Shias in Iraq and we have a picture of great instability. As many speakers have said, we need to talk with Iran and Syria. I welcome the proposals that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, gave us and what he said about the region having to have a real stake in, not just a single conference on, the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000010"></a>Then we turn to Afghanistan, the other country in which this nation has a direct military commitment. I spoke about reconstruction in our debate on 10 October, and we have had a series of opportunities to speak on NATO and Afghanistan in the past two months. As noble Lords will know, I do not accept the criticisms that have been generally voiced about NATO&#146;s performance. We owe NATO quite a lot for the progress that has been made in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000011"></a>On this occasion, I will deal briefly with only two aspects. The first is opium production. The Minister in his beautiful way said that the increase is &#147;disappointing&#148;. As my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby gave us the area statistics for increase of production, let me give another statistic. This is from the <I>Washington Post </I>of 2 December, which reported that the 2006 production of the crop has broken all previous records. In addition to a 26 per cent production increase over the past year, coming to a total of 5,644 metric tonnes, the area of land being cultivated grew by 61 per cent. In the areas that we are interested in&#151;the two main production provinces of Helmand in the south-west and Uruzgan in central Afghanistan&#151;production was up by 132 per cent. Does the Minister recognise these figures? Are these the ones that are disappointing? If so, what does it mean for our strategy?</p>

<p><a name="061205101000012"></a>We on these Benches support the analysis that Afghanistan is a direct security threat to the UK in two different ways: because the training of terrorists  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that al-Qaeda carried out in the past could be re-established; and because the country is a provider of heroin on the streets of Britain. But if we are losing the battle on that second half of the dual threat, what changes of policy do the British Government envisage? We have had some ideas from noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, highlighted the importance of alternative livelihoods, and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, gave us a picture of the economic challenges and the way in which the economy might be developed.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000013"></a>The second question that I would like to draw to your Lordships&#146; attention is more difficult&#151;whether we have adopted the most appropriate military strategy for stabilising the south and east of Afghanistan. The noble Lord, Lord Blaker, spoke about the Canadian approach, but noble Lords might be interested in a very thoughtful report in the <I>Toronto Globe and Mail</I> this Saturday, which looked at techniques used by the Dutch in the very challenging Uruzgan province. The Dutch did a concerted hearts and minds operation with 1,400 troops. The commander described his approach as follows:</p>
<ul><a name="061205101000078"></a>&#147;It&#146;s a strategy focused on supporting the local government rather than killing its supposed enemies, talking with the Taliban instead of fighting them, and treading carefully with an understanding of how little any foreigner knows about this untamed country&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61205-0012.htm"/>


<a name="061205101000014"></a>The Canadian reporter contrasted that with the more gung-ho&#151;but certainly less successful in terms of casualties&#151;approach adopted by the Canadians in the next-door province of Kandahar. There are lessons for our own approach here. As I have said before, the other Europeans have made progress over the last five years in Afghanistan because they have worked with the people at a slow pace&#151;a pace that we could go at with the number of troops that we have. There are no easy military-style solutions. 
<p><a name="061205101000015"></a>I was very taken by the point that my noble friend Lady Williams made on the continuity of commanders. These are lessons that you learn on the ground. If by the time you have learnt them you get posted and someone else from another nation has to relearn them, there is no continuity in approach, which gives rise to dangers for us.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000016"></a>Before I leave the subject of Iraq and Afghanistan, I must comment on the special problem that the two very challenging operations give the British Armed Forces. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, the noble Baroness, Lady Park, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, spoke on this subject. I spoke about it in the Queen&#146;s Speech debate as well. We all know that the defence planning assumptions have been exceeded not on a routine but on a continuous basis for the past seven years. Either those defence planning assumptions must be changed, which will involve additional resource costs because that is what they generate, or we reduce the tasks. We cannot carry on doing it in this way or we will end up with broken forces.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000017"></a>I would have liked to have spent some time on the situation in Iran, but I expect that we will be coming back to that as things develop. My noble friend Lord  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Wallace of Saltaire spoke wisely on how we should be handling Iran. I trust that we will not see any precipitate pre-emptive military action taking place there. But we also have to think of the implications for Iran and hence for Saudi Arabia if Iraq fragments, which may also lead to the possibility of conflict.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000018"></a>I turn finally to the Middle East peace process, Israel and its problems. We have had a rich debate on this, to which many noble Lords contributed. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester spoke about the effect of checkpoints. Those of us who have worked in the West Bank and Gaza very rapidly came to understand how they generate anger. If that can happen in a short time, I do not know what it must like to be there all the time. The right reverend Prelate&#146;s description of the situation around Rachel&#146;s Tomb was important in terms of understanding the problems. The noble Lords, Lord Wright of Richmond and Lord Judd, and my noble friends Lady Tonge and Lord Jacobs all spoke with passion from different perspectives. It is important that we have those different perspectives.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000019"></a>We have a very fragile peace at the moment. Indeed, it is a measure of how parlous the situation is that we take comfort from the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel and the UN-monitored ceasefire between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel. Neither situation is stable or likely to be long-lasting unless progress is made in finding a way for this small but volatile region to live at peace. As King Abdullah told us, we are running out of time. As many noble Lords have said, Israel has managed by its actions to produce an elected Hamas Government as well as Hezbollah&#146;s increasing power within Lebanon. Given the current scene, it looks set to get worse.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000020"></a>My noble friend Lord Wallace reminded us that reports over the weekend suggest that Saudi Arabia is ready to take a lead in brokering an Arab-Israeli peace deal based on the initiative of four years ago. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on that.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000021"></a>We have talked about the engagement of Syria and Iran. I was struck by the contributions of the noble Lords, Lord Skidelsky and Lord Hylton. The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, made clear the importance of engaging these nations. It appears that President Bush has no great interest in doing much more. He did not bother to do anything while he was in Jordan. We have to advance this, if necessary without America, until America is ready to help. The Oslo agreement was done without America kick-starting the process.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000022"></a>In an article in today&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>, Zbigniew Brzezinski says:</p>
<ul><a name="061205101000079"></a>&#147;The destructive war in Iraq, the hypocritical indifference to the human dimensions of the stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian relations, the lack of diplomatic initiative in dealing with Iran and the frequent use of Islamophobic rhetoric are setting in motion forces that threaten to push America out of the Middle East, with dire consequences for itself and its friends in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia&#148;.</ul><a name="061205101000073"></a>That quote is equally true of the UK in its role as the unquestioning ally of the US.  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1140"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="061205101000023"></a>Wherever we have looked across the Middle East and Afghanistan, it is clear that the long-term imposition of security by military means is impossible. The military, by making the rule of law possible, must be the facilitators of the more important political and economic development, whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq or Afghanistan. Too often the military operation becomes the central focus of attention, and quick military solutions lead to long and deep resentment which compounds the problems and makes peace more difficult. If the international community fails, we have the prospect of civil wars in Lebanon and Iraq, and perhaps conflict within and between other parts of the region. That must not happen. I agree with the Minister&#146;s caution in his opening speech: a failed strategy in the region will come back to haunt us in the United Kingdom.</p>

I consider it an honour to do so, but also a somewhat daunting challenge. It has been a typically outstanding debate. We would expect no less with such expertise in your Lordships&#146; House as we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, in her masterly overview.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000025"></a>My noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford opened with a characteristically forceful and important speech that covered Iraq and the Middle East. The situation in Iraq and other parts of the region, including Israel-Palestine, has been well covered by your Lordships. Events in Iraq were sadly in the news again this weekend. I do not intend to add much to what has been said so ably and eloquently by noble Lords. At this late hour I will concentrate primarily on reconstruction and Afghanistan, a nation I have discussed regularly in this House since 1994. I should declare an interest, as I have done many times, as patron of Afghan Mother and Child Rescue.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000026"></a>Many noble Lords emphasised how important it is that we do not forget the demanding challenges we face in Afghanistan. Just as the UN estimated that October saw the highest number of fatalities since the Iraq war began, so this year has been the most costly since the Afghan campaign began, with the awful figure of nearly 4,000 deaths, one-quarter of them civilians. Much impressive work, though, is being achieved in Afghanistan, as the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, told us. A democratically elected national assembly and provincial councils have been launched within the past 12 months, giving the country its first legitimate Government since 1973. A professional supreme court has recently been created. Significant improvements in infrastructure continue to take place, from road-building to irrigation projects and the hydropower stations completed in Ghor by Afghan Aid, a remarkable charity.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000027"></a>The United Nations Security Council has admitted, however, that progress this year has not been as rapid as hoped. Many development agencies are finding their reconstruction efforts increasingly vulnerable. Security is clearly a problem, especially in the southern provinces. Unfulfilled aid promises and depleting resources  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are also severely weakening those efforts and pose long-term problems that require long-term responses. Just as it was a disappointment to learn in Riga last week that German, French, Italian and Spanish Governments would not commit troops to the areas of the country that most need them, so it is displeasing to hear of Governments reducing their development commitments to Afghanistan when there is still so much to be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000028"></a>We have heard interesting contributions from all around the House on the problems of security, especially in the knowledgeable speech from my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth. She also pointed out how the Foreign Office budget has been overtaken by DfID. In the debate on the gracious Speech I, too, mentioned that DfID now receives twice as much in funds as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does. </p>

<p><a name="061205101000029"></a>At the summit in Riga, NATO heads of state declared:</p>
<ul><a name="061205101000080"></a>&#147;There can be no security in Afghanistan without development, and no development without security&#148;.</ul><a name="061205101000074"></a>NATO must now recognise the importance of development for the enduring political and military success of its Afghan campaign. Less parochially and selfishly, we must justify our continued presence after five years to the local population. That requires visible evidence of reconstruction, through basic facilities such as fresh water&#151;still denied to the majority of the population&#151;renewed infrastructure or employment and education opportunities for both males and females. 
<p><a name="061205101000030"></a>We also support the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, who in her informative speech stressed, as many others did, the need for better security and reconstruction, the plight of women and the furthering of microfinance facilities. The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, put into context how vital&#151;or, as he said, crucial&#151;Turkey&#146;s role and position is to our future. We on the Opposition Benches completely agree with him there. Time does not allow me to refer to all the speakers, but my noble friend Lord Blaker and many others asked the Minister to urge that there be discussion of the Baker study group&#146;s report, which is due out tomorrow. Can the Minister press for that in the not-too-distant future?</p>

<p><a name="061205101000031"></a>It is very important that we actively encourage good governance in Afghanistan and local participation in development projects, particularly in the context of the resurgent Taliban and the influence exerted by the country&#146;s drug barons. Let us look into creative ways of dealing with the opium problem, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, emphasised. The launch of democratic bodies across the country is a heartening start, but, as in Iraq, we should recognise that there is no short-term solution and no room for complacency after achieving an initial goal.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000032"></a>Government organisations in the country are still fragile and need our continued support and authority. Corruption is a continuing, widespread problem that threatens the credibility and popularity of the new Afghan Government. Few would disagree that we should target government officials who have links to  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1142"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drug money, showing the people that we are serious about both narcotics and corruption. Both the weakness of the local police force and the lack of effective rule of law urgently need to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000033"></a>I shall finish on a more positive note, about the successes and potential successes of reconstruction. In the youngest age groups, a third of all schoolchildren are now girls. Joint international and Afghan programmes are providing more employment opportunities to the local population, of whom over a third are unemployed. Many roads and villages have been rebuilt from total ruin; we need to show unwavering commitment to these and other projects.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000034"></a>It is perhaps too optimistic to believe that visible success in reconstructing Afghanistan could help stimulate those in Iraq to pursue a similar goal, but it is certainly the least that the long-suffering Afghan people deserve. Economic insecurity and intense military activity over the past three decades have been aggravated by flooding and food shortages from severe drought. What is clear from today&#146;s fascinating debate is that we cannot neglect Afghanistan now.</p>

The knowledge of the House has been brought to bear and I thank all noble Lords who have spoken for the great quality of their speeches, which were intellectually gripping and moving.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000036"></a>Noble Lords who have held the highest offices of state in the United Kingdom&#151;or who have been responsible for the safety, security and representation of this country&#151; know only too well how easy it is to offer grand visions for peace in the Middle East, but how much more difficult it is to find practical solutions that work. Ending conflict, building peace and expanding democracy and growth require decades of confidence-building, conciliation and commitment to succeed. That may be disappointing but there are no quick fixes. That is why we must focus our efforts on strengthening the political and military reach of the Iraqi Government of national unity so that they can take over that responsibility in their country. There will be no cut and run in Iraq. We must make sure that the distinctive task of supporting President Karzai&#146;s Government in Afghanistan is achieved fully and properly with no cut and run. We must also encourage the Israeli and Palestinian authorities and their neighbours to move along the path of peace.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000037"></a>We need to understand fully the reminder of the noble Lord, Lord Soley, that on occasion the price at which we bought stability was that of accepting co-operation with dictatorships. The noble Lord, Lord Luce, made a similar point. That tells us something about living in modern times. I appreciated very much the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, which, with that of the noble Lord, Lord Luce, demonstrated how the national origins of many of the countries with which we are dealing have thrown up complexities, resulting in cultural barriers which  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1143"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are hard to deal with. In trying to address what is needed, the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, called for greater links between groups of countries that could, if they were so minded, unlock a helpful process. I refer to a possibly small but none the less helpful move. About an hour and a half ago Reuters reported that the Iraqi Prime Minister said that he was sending envoys immediately to neighbouring countries to seek co-operation on improving security in the area and that he would soon call a conference of regional states on the issue. I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that conferences can be talking shops and may not work better than other measures, but I may return to that point.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000038"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Lord, Lord Garden, addressed tactical and military questions. I shall deal briefly with some of them, as I wish to discuss many other issues as well. The tactics and procedures of British forces remain under constant review. They are adapted and refined in line with individual situations and circumstances as they evolve. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, was right to say that the media give little credit to the significant role that the forces can play as they make those changes. Our forces have developed expertise, experience and best practice, which, as I said, is evolving, to deal with counter-insurgency, peace support and anti-terrorist operations. They do so with proper rules of engagement and carefully prescribed laws of armed conflict. Their behaviour is crucial to how we are perceived. Unlike insurgents and militias, our troops operate within that legal and moral constraint, which is as much a part of determining tactics as any of the military questions that arise. Courage, compassion and commitment are shown by all the service personnel. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, did us a great favour in describing realistically their readiness and capacity.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000039"></a>Are we overstretched? Our commitments to Afghanistan and Iraq take account of the changes in the requirements in each of those countries. We continually review our force levels in each theatre. I assure the House that the current levels are manageable and that they give the commanders what they need to do the job. The Armed Forces are, of course, heavily committed but the number of regular Armed Forces deployed on operations has decreased during the last year. I am told that the figure now stands at around 18 per cent overall. I do not deny that that is challenging, but I am told that commanders believe it is sustainable. I do not want to keep a single member of the Armed Forces in Iraq or elsewhere for a moment longer than is necessary. But we will not draw down those troops until we, our coalition partners and, in particular, the Iraqi and Afghan Governments are confident that those Governments are ready to take over. As I said, that is our sovereign choice; it is not in any sense imposed on us.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000040"></a>I shall say a few words about Israel and Palestine and the Middle East peace process. It cannot be said that we have no clear strategy for advancing the process. The Prime Minister has consistently made it clear that moving towards a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, as set out in the road map as a model, is the central plank for achieving peace.  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Prime Minister has taken every opportunity to urge the United States to re-energise the peace process. In 2004, with strong support from the United Kingdom, President Bush committed himself to working towards that two-state solution&#151;the first President of the United States to do so. I have emphasised, as has the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, quite rightly, the potential role for the EU. I count that as essential.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000041"></a>There has been a question about the Foreign Office and the conduct of foreign policy. I want to deal with the issue broadly. I will never argue against the Foreign Office getting more money or the Comprehensive Spending Review being more generous. Foreign policy is still developed in the Foreign Office, which may come as something of a surprise to one or two noble Lords. It would be a fiction to suggest that it is undertaken entirely by the Prime Minister. Of course the Prime Minister&#146;s office and the Foreign Office work closely together. When, historically, was that not the case? The challenges and opportunities in the world today are truly global. Foreign policy is an integral part of domestic policy. Indeed, it is inconceivable that this or any future Prime Minister, of any party, could sit at the sidelines and not have foreign policy and its implications in their mind as they deal with matters.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000042"></a>I shall turn now to the vital points made during the debate, in the order of the speakers. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, in a typically thoughtful contribution, argued that we needed to engage others without threats. I have some sympathy with that argument, but there is a difficulty with it. This is clearest when we look at a country such as Iran&#146;s nuclear development, which is bound to be a matter for the United Nations Security Council. Iran has a great deal of historical pride, and we must respect that, but a balance must be struck between the effort to keep people within the camp of friends and ensuring that they do not take steps with which we could not live in the future. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, made essentially the same point. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Howell, will accept the point I made. I hope I did not suggest that we needed a lot more regional conferences; I believe that we need rather more durable structures than that.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000043"></a>Despite what the noble Lord said, I believe that we make a genuine impact. I want to give one example. Diplomatic talks in recent weeks have undoubtedly convinced Syria that British foreign policy has been changing in a way that it should respond to. The visit to Damascus in October by Sir Nigel Sheinwald unquestionably made an impact on how that country considers reaching out to its neighbours. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, made some very important points. I do not accept his point that deception led to the Iraq war. Four inquiries were held; they did not find that deception had taken place. There may well be disagreement over the wisdom of it; people are perfectly entitled to take that view.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000044"></a>I also do not accept the noble Lord&#146;s view of Labour&#146;s tradition of internationalism. I have always thought of myself&#151;I hope not unfairly&#151;as an internationalist. One of the things that internationalism  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1145"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taught me when I looked at Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime is that internationalists cannot be quiescent when a dictator decides to wipe out the entire socialist part of his country, every active trade unionist he can lay his hands on, the Marsh Arabs and most of the Kurds. They all had to be protected in the final analysis, albeit too late for many of them.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000045"></a>In all of this, as my noble friend Lady Symons said, it is right that in moving forward in our international relations we do not set unreasonable preconditions. The same point has been made by a number of noble Lords. But internationalism does not simply mean that we are welded to the United Nations. On occasions, as my noble friend Lord Soley said, it means, as it did in Kosovo, that some independence must be exercised. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred to Spain, France and Italy. Although their plan came as something of a surprise to the Palestinians, the Israelis and, I believe, everyone else, none the less it is well worth exploring, and we are not resistant to doing so. I conclude my response to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, by saying that I agree with him 100 per cent that criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism and it should not be characterised as such unless there is specific evidence of anti-Semitism in a free-standing way.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000046"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said that the dispute in the Middle East should not be allowed to drag on. I believe that we are major contributors to trying to deal with that continued violence and to ensuring that the Palestinian state, as it emerges, becomes economically viable. There are some fundamentals that probably do not have to be rehearsed in this House but I shall say them in brief, telegram form. The Israelis should not build on Palestinian land and they should not build their fence on Palestinian land; equally, they should not be subjected to rocket attacks in their beds at night. They have a right to defence, and even a fence if it is on their own land.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000047"></a>My noble friend Lady Symons of Vernham Dean made some vital points and I hope that I can do them justice. It is crucial that in Afghanistan we create new livelihoods. Security is essential to doing so, and a number of NATO states are feeling their way towards that. They are all sovereign states and they have differences of view, but I agree with my noble friend that more engagement is absolutely essential.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000048"></a>I also agree with the points that she and others made about the role of women. Briefly, the FCO/DfID gender strategy for Afghanistan&#151;it is available in the Library of the House of Commons and I should probably ensure that it is available in our House as well&#151;remains the cornerstone of our approach. The priorities outlined and the objectives that we are funding include: promoting security and the rule of law for women; promoting women&#146;s civil and political rights; and protecting women&#146;s economic, social and cultural rights. Further, through the Global Opportunities Fund of the FCO, we are sponsoring a number of projects that are specifically designed to increase women&#146;s access to justice; improve their living standards; promote equal participation in governance; create a professional  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>network of women&#146;s rights organisations; and promote access to information through the radio. I assure the House that that programme will continue vigorously.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000049"></a>There is a robust discussion with Syria, and I have just mentioned Sir Nigel Sheinwald&#146;s mission there. In response to my noble friend and to a number of other noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, and the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, I can also say that I believe that, when the Baker-Hamilton report comes out, it will repay early study. I guess that we will be studying it at the end of this week. I cannot commit the House and its authorities to a discussion, but I find it a little hard to imagine that there will not be one. The Prime Minister is going back to the region very soon, and we are awaiting the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. We do not expect the study group to advocate sudden withdrawal but, if it does, we will not support it. A clear-cut view of our own will be put forward.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000050"></a>I understand the points that the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, made. I wish that people would go back and re-read John Reid&#146;s statement because I believe that it has lost a little in translation. He said that he hoped that shots would not be fired in action. He also said that he did not anticipate too much good fortune. I think that John Reid usually says what he thinks in terms, and I suspect that re-reading what he said will repay the reader.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000051"></a>I turn to the balanced and, as ever, very honourable comments and questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. I thank her for her kindness to me. Being in Australia certainly had its attractions this evening, although I am not sure that the same could be said of keeping wicket. The reconstruction has plainly had its failures. It would be frivolous not to say so. Unemployment is plainly one of the driving forces of continued instability. The financial waste which appears in the Waxman report is very telling. Who could deny that? I am also concerned about rotation, although I am no expert on the speed of rotation of commanders and I shall not pretend to be.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000052"></a>I hope I am not complacent about narcotics. The call in this House is for greater imagination; consideration of the issues of acquiring the poppy crop and so on is very important. If corruption exists in those areas, it is important that it is attacked at the very top of any Government who are involved.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000053"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and other Members of the House&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Wright, Lord Turnberg and Lord Jacobs&#151;I commend the Olmert speech. I ask colleagues to read it if they have not done so. It contains a number of new options that can be taken up. I believe that President Abbas will do so. The United Kingdom will be consistent in the way in which it approaches those matters. It will be consistent on the wall, on the settlements and on Israel's right to exist peacefully.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61205-0013.htm"/>



<p><a name="061205101000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wright, brought great wisdom to the debate. I also thought that the speech of King Abdullah was very significant. The approach to the Palestinians has to be far fairer. Plainly that is one of the requirements. I do not believe that anyone should  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>describe the election in the Palestinian territories as illegitimate in any way, but the responsibilities that come with election are also unavoidable. The new Government have to step away from violence; they have to recognise the right of Israel to exist; and they have to honour what their nation has signed up for. Those are not, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, put it, simply preconditions that might come out in a discussion. To my mind things can be done&#151;things that can indicate the basis for a far greater confidence as other discussions go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000055"></a>Our approach to aid and the amelioration of suffering, also mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Wright, is very important. Aid is not everything, but it is very significant in the region at present. A just and lasting settlement, of course, is absolutely fundamental, which is why I have talked of mutual confidence. I am told that the FCO has sufficient resources and I intend to ensure that they are exploited to the last penny.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000056"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd made some vital points as well. We do not talk only with those to whom it is easy to talk; I can promise him that from day-to-day, first-hand experience. I also accept his proposition that military power alone will never deliver peace and security anywhere. Dealing with poverty is crucial in any conflict. Well focused aid, with long-term objectives, is absolutely vital in any conflict, including in the areas that my noble friend Lord Judd mentioned&#151;education and health. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, mentioned the same point. However, in areas of conflict there has to be a force that is capable of creating enough stability for those kinds of hearts and minds campaigns and aid programmes to work.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000057"></a>On military hospitals and the answers that I and others have given on Selly Oak, I refer the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, to an answer which I hope is uncontentious. We want any of our personnel who are injured, wounded or ill to be treated with the very best medical resources and facilities available to them. I believe that those are overwhelmingly in the National Health Service.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000058"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, asked whether we have sovereignty over our Armed Forces in the present circumstances. The initiative is with us. We took a principled position, of our own volition, and we shall continue to do so. The circumstances on the ground will determine how the states in the region see matters and rebuilding states will make it easier. That is how we will be guided.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, made a number of vital points, some of which were also made by the noble Lord, Lord Luce. In my view, there also needs to be systematic regional organisation&#151;more than a conference. There needs to be a serious evaluation of the prospects for doing that.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000060"></a>At one time some people believed that the African Union as a regional body looked impossible. It is still work in progress, but our expectations of it grow all the time because its impact grows and it is more effective. Regional bodies can have such a purpose. That is allied to the point that Europe must work much harder, with a dedicated role to do so, at the Middle East peace process.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1148"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="061205101000061"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, argued that prosperity often needs to precede democracy&#151;I hope that I am not putting words into his mouth. As an economist I understand that important general proposition, but it is not universally true. The DRC and Mozambique&#151;I could probably go through others&#151;have managed to reverse that process. We have to take the gains where we can and marry them. Maybe that was also part of the force of what the noble Viscount said. We must persist and finish the job; he expressed absolutely the right sentiment.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000062"></a>I find it a little hard to accept the relativistic distinction that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made between the motivations of those who murder people in some numbers. Whether or not one takes that view, in dealing with many organisations that are committed to violence&#151;the IRA was mentioned&#151;it is vital to find out what people want if there is to be contact and negotiation with them. Usually it is expressed in terms of political power, distribution of resources, national or regional status. There has to be something about which a negotiation can be conducted. Al-Qaeda has never provided the smallest clue as to any such objective on which a rational discussion could take place.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, with his customary brilliance, raised the question of Turkey. I completely agree with him, as did the noble Lord, Lord Garden. We should take the most positive role in negotiations. We launched that during our presidency, and I am proud of that. We must move toward full membership. I will take his vital message back to the FCO because I believe that that deliberation should help guide our work to secure Turkish membership of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000064"></a>I have a number of facts about the state of the Afghan economy, which I would love to tell the House, if I did not think that I would be trespassing too far in response to the questions posed by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, but I will write to him, as the detail is worth having and I will place a copy of the letter in the Library. I have nothing on transport costs but I will look at that as well.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000065"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford called on us to build on diversity and to offer diplomatic routes using the most diverse channels. I have a good deal of sympathy with that proposition. Indeed, our relations with some Islamic countries have moved not backward but forward. In many respects, Pakistan is a good example, because it has seen that we are not hostile to Islam and not fundamentally unsympathetic.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Garden, presents me with a problem. I hope that he will not take it as ill spirited if I say candidly that he has no monopoly on the pain felt regarding the number of murders in Baghdad and Iraq. Many of us feel that strongly, and I do not believe that there is complacency in any of our souls. Iraq is horrific, but it is not all in the same state. On occasions we should give a little more credit to the Governments of countries and to provinces. His noble friend Lord Clement-Jones made that point about the Kurdish areas in the debate a couple of weeks ago.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1149"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="061205101000067"></a>It should not be too painful for any of us to acknowledge the achievements of other people in these difficult circumstances when there are achievements to acknowledge. I invite the House to ponder that. I do not believe that we have brought all this on the Iraqi people. I will not repeat my comments about Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000068"></a>In the southern areas, drugs are a difficult problem. I am sorry if my language was not as florid as might appeal to some noble Lords. Drugs are a very serious issue, but until we can get security into that part of the country, we will be in grave difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000069"></a>I greatly welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said in recognition of the progress that is being made, even if it has not been as fast as we would have all hoped for in Afghanistan. The role of the charities and the NGOs is invaluable. I feel the greatest admiration when I observe what they are able to achieve. The Governments across Europe must maintain their donor obligations. It is right that they  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1150"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 1150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should do so and it is absolutely right that security and development are utterly interdependent. Both have got to be taken seriously as part of our forward programme.</p>

<p><a name="061205101000070"></a>In conclusion, it is an enormously difficult area, but the comments that I have made about each of the countries&#151;and I have placed the Middle East peace process at the centre of the debate because the Government and the Prime Minister do so&#151;I hope have made it clear that there is no want of energy and no lack of perspective in driving this forward. As the King of Jordan said in the Robing Room of your Lordships&#146; House only a short while ago, this will be our most testing time. We have to rise to that challenge and we must do it with a good deal of, to coin the phrase, pessimism of the intellect and toughness in our thinking, but we have must do it with more pessimism and more credit for those who are working with us to achieve it.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="06120573000008"></a>The Committee met at half-past three of the clock.</h4>

<p><a name="06120573000010"></a><b><a name="06120573000103"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo):</b> Before the Minister moves the first set of regulations I should advise the Committee that, in the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that it do report that it has considered the order in question. I should also make it clear that this Committee is charged only to consider orders and not to approve them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="06120573000002"></a>Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006</h3>

<p><a name="06120573000011"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0001.htm_spnew85"></a><a name="06120573000104"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move,That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006.<I> First Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee and2nd Report from the Merits Committee.</I></p>

<p><a name="06120573000093"></a>The noble Lord said: The statutory instruments, which were debated in the other place this morning, underpin the legislative framework needed to regulate the activities of claim management companies, which is contained in Part 2 of the Compensation Act 2006. The Compensation Act received Royal Assent on25 July. Part 2 provides a detailed framework for the regulation of claims management services. Claims farmers have remained unregulated for too long. Some encourage frivolous claims through aggressive marketing techniques, mislead consumers about the options for funding their claim, and provide poor-quality advice and service. Consumers have been suffering and there is an urgent need to tackle these abuses and raise standards across the industry.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000094"></a>The delivery of the Act was a major achievement. Work has progressed at a remarkable pace and the regulatory framework is now being implemented. Under the current arrangements, the Secretary of State will be the regulator. Mark Boleat has been appointed as the DCA&#146;s head of regulation and Staffordshire County Council trading standards unit has been contracted to carry out the DCA&#146;s monitoring and compliance function. The unit will process applications for authorisation, monitor compliance with the rules and support the DCA&#146;s regulatory efforts by seeking out any business that attempts to evade regulation.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000095"></a>Regulation by the Secretary of State is intended as an interim measure. The Legal Services Bill, which was introduced on 23 November, will establish a new framework for legal services regulation, including a legal services board and an office of legal complaints. It is intended that claims management regulation will become integrated into the new structure.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120573000096"></a>When the Compensation Act was debated Ministers made it clear that the Government wished to see a major change in the quality of service and an improvement in the behaviour of claims management businesses to help improve safeguards for consumers. The orders and regulations which are before the Committee today will help achieve this aim. A wide-ranging consultation exercise on the orders and regulations took place. The Government&#146;s response to the consultation was published on 30 November.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000097"></a>The regulations are made under the powers in Section 8(8) of, and the Schedule to, the Act. These set out the requirements that service providers should meet to obtain authorisation and other details relating to the operation of regulatory mechanisms. The regulations are necessarily detailed and technical. I will outline the key provisions relating to the authorisation process, rules, complaint schemes and enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000012"></a>The regulations set out a range of matters to which the regulator may have regard in making a decision about an applicant&#146;s competence and suitability. The regulator can impose conditions on an authorisation. Some conditions are imposed directly by the regulations. Examples include the requirement that the authorised person complies with the rules made by the regulator, and that if the person accepts referral of potential clients from an unauthorised person, the former takes reasonable steps to ensure that the unauthorised person complies with the rules.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000013"></a>The application form for authorisation will require details about directors, partners and anyone else capable of having a significant influence on the policy or management of the business; regulatory action against both the business and the individuals involved and all claims management businesses in which those involved with an applicant have been involved in the past five years; and self-certification that the business complies with the regulator&#146;s rules of conduct. The regulations will ensure that only those who meet the criteria for authorisation and agree to comply with the rules are authorised.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000014"></a>Applicants will have the right of appeal to the Claims Management Services Tribunal established by the Act against a decision of the regulator concerning an application, and an appeal from the tribunal to the Court of Appeal. Tribunal rules will be made in February 2007 when the relevant provisions of the Act are brought into force.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000015"></a>Under the Act, in paragraph 8 of the schedule, the regulator must prescribe rules for the professional conduct of authorised persons. The regulations set out the procedures for doing so. The rules clarify and expand on the requirements that all authorised persons must comply with. The rules focus on a few key points: prohibition of high-pressure selling including cold calling in person; transparent contracts and disclosure of referral fees; complaints procedure; and clients&#146; accounts if clients&#146; money is held. Key stakeholders and claims management businesses were consulted on the rules, which have now been approved by my noble and learned friend the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000016"></a>Consumers also need protection when things go wrong. The regulations create powers for the regulator to require an authorised person to have professional  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>indemnity insurance. The rules require authorised persons to have a clear mechanism for dealing with complaints. The regulator can review the handling by an authorised person of a complaint and can give directions in regard to complaints handling and related matters. When an authorised person has failed to comply with the rules, the regulations provide for a limited power to require redress. This is a significant part of the regulator&#146;s power to protect consumers from unsatisfactory work or other improper practices by those providing claims management services. The regulator may direct the repayment of unjustified fees&#151;that is, a fee that should not have been charged. It cannot order a cash payment for redress; that will follow when complaints handling comes within the Office of Legal Complaints proposed in the Legal Services Bill.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000017"></a>It is imperative that regulation can be enforced effectively. The regulations therefore create powers for the regulator to investigate breaches of the rules to require the provision of documents and to enter and search premises and take copies of documents. The regulator&#146;s investigatory powers are exercisable in relation to an allegation or a suspicion that a person is providing a regulated claims management service without being an authorised or exempted person or having the benefit of a waiver of the obligation to be authorised or that an authorised person is acting in contravention of the rules.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000018"></a>The regulator must first seek information from the person or authorised person by serving a notice requiring the provision of specified information or documents. If the information or documents are not provided, or they reveal further grounds for investigation, the regulator may apply to a judge or justice of the peace for a search warrant. The regulator will also be able to impose sanctions, including suspension, or, ultimately, cancellation of authorisation. There is a right of appeal to the Claims Management Services Tribunal against a suspension or cancellation, and from the tribunal to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000019"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree on the importance of regulating claims management services and putting in place safeguards for consumers. Regulating claims management services is a necessary step for protecting consumers. The arrangements under the regulations I have briefly outlined will help to achieve that aim.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000020"></a>The Compensation (Specification of Benefits) Order 2006 is made under Section 4(5) of the Act and will bring claims management services provided in relation to industrial injuries disablement benefits within the regulatory net. These are compensatory benefits and include reduced earnings allowance, retirement allowance and industrial death benefit. This order will ensure that consumers seeking such benefits and engaging the services of a claims management business will be protected by regulation. </p>

<p><a name="06120573000021"></a>I shall speak to the Compensation (Regulated Claims Management Services) Order 2006 and shall refer to it as the scope order. It is made under the power in Section 4(2)(e) of the Act. The definition of claims management services in the Act is wide to ensure that there are no loopholes. Such services are  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulated only if they are prescribed by order. The scope order sets out the range of activities that are to be regulated as claims management services and in relation to what kind of claim. It will cover, for example, advertising for or otherwise seeking out persons who may have a claim, advising persons on the merits of a potential claim, referring details of such claims and investigating the circumstances or merits of a claim.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000022"></a>The types of claim for compensation in relation to which the above activities will be regulated initially include claims relating to personal injury, criminal injuries compensation, employment, housing disrepair, claims in relation to financial products or services, including the emerging area of excessive bank charges, and, finally, industrial injuries disablement benefits.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000023"></a>We are targeting these areas because we believe that they are where there is the greatest risk of firms engaging in claims handling practices that are against the public interest and lead to consumer detriment. Any person providing a regulated claims management service in those areas will need to be authorised, exempted by order or have the benefit of a waiver. The Compensation (Exemptions) Order 2006 was laid on 28 November and specifies those who will be exempted from the obligation of authorisation. I look forward to a full debate on that order in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000024"></a>Defining sectors to be regulated by order provides flexibility to allow new areas to be brought within the scope of regulation when problems surface and for areas to be removed from the scope if no longer in need of regulation. I should make clear that services provided to a defendant are outside the intended scope and are not regarded as being within the definition of claims management services in the Act.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000025"></a>I commend the orders and regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000026"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006. <I>First Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee and 2nd Report from the Merits Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="06120573000027"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0001.htm_spnew86"></a><a name="06120573000105"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> We have some brief observations on two of the three orders to which the Minister has spoken, the Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006 and the Compensation (Regulated Claims Management Services) Order 2006. We wish to raise two matters on the Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006: overlapping regulatory systems and authorisation.</p>
<h5><a name="06120573000099"></a>3.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120573000028"></a>As far as overlapping regulation is concerned, as I understand it, the claims management services regulations apply where there is an element of uninsured risk. The most common example is where a customer has a no-fault insurance motor claim but has sustained injuries and does not have a before-the-event legal expenses policy. Many brokers, including insurance brokers, have been fully regulated by the Financial Services Authority since mid-2005; yet the new claims management services regulations will apply to all organisations that  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>offer a claims management service, including those already regulated. Rather than simply applying the new regulations to organisations currently outside the existing regulatory regime, the insurance brokers, for example, which are offering claims management services, will be regulated twice over.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000029"></a>We believe that all aspects of claims management services provided by brokers should be exempt. The current draft of the new regulations provides for a limited level of exemption, which in our view is far too narrow. It is surprising that the Government have not listened to those who have raised this point, because their approach under the order goes against the whole risk-based approach that they now tell us informs all their regulatory activity. The brokers to which I have referred now face a situation wheretwo separate bodies are involved in regulating intermediary claims activity. This cannot be in the best interests of either the efficient running of the businesses or their customers.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000030"></a>On authorisation, Regulation 12(5)(c) states that a business must take responsibility for those who introduce business to them, but that the individuals&#151;the business introducing individuals&#151;do not require authorisation. Is that the right approach? It is the activities of those who introduce business that have caused most of the damage to the sector&#146;s reputation; that is, the damage that the Government have aimed to tackle through the Compensation Act. The unregulated behaviour of speculative canvassing has misled consumers and generated thousands of spurious claims in the past. This needs to be addressed at the source rather than policed ineffectively by proxy. Many of these individuals are freelance and not tied agents.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000031"></a>I do not think that it can be said against me that a requirement for authorisation is over-regulation. Without a requirement for all individuals and businesses involved in the claims process to be authorised in their own right, the unregulated market in claims introductions will continue and the Government will have failed in their aim to regulate out bad practitioners. Why is a requirement for individuals to seek authorisation impractical? How would a system such as the one proposed by the Government be overseen by the regulator? How can the regulator be confident that it will generate the results that the Government seek? What will the requirement be for businesses to ensure compliance in those from whom they obtain referrals&#151;people who are not in any way authorised at all? All those points seem to be germane to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000032"></a>The Minister will be pleased to hear that I turn now, more briefly, to the Compensation (Regulated Claims Management Services) Order, on which I wish simply to raise one point. Paragraph (3)(e), states that claims management activities include, subject to paragraph (4), referring details of a claim or claimant or a course of action or potential claimant to another person, including a person having the right to conduct litigation. Paragraph (4) makes it clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120573000098"></a>&#147;the service of referring a claim&#146;s or a claimant&#146;s details to another person is not a regulated claims management service if it is not undertaken for or in expectation of a fee, gain or reward&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120573000033"></a>The Government will allow a limited number of referrals for a fee if they are incidental to the main business of an organisation. An illustration of this might be a vehicle repair firm being paid by solicitors to refer customers who have been in road traffic accidents to those solicitors. In our submission, the Secretary of State as regulator should ensure that all persons carrying out any activity described in one of the categories that I have set out in paragraph (3) are properly regulated. How will a judgment on referrals that are incidental be made, whether in terms of numbers per month or the scale of the fee paid? To allow up to 100 claims per year for each body shop across the country, for example, would permit a very substantial number of unregulated claims generating significant income outside the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000034"></a>If a garage or body shop is to be able to pass on referrals to solicitors for a fee, outside the regulatory system, that would undermine the whole principle of consumer protection enshrined in the Act. Body shops are often the first port of call for consumers following road accidents. Opportunities for disreputable practice in this market need to be addressed. It is not right that body shops should be free to refer claims for financial incentives while avoiding regulation to which others are subject. There is no justification whatever for incidental referrals for a fee, reward or gain to fall outside the scope of authorisation as regulated activities. Can the Minister guarantee that garages and body shops that pass on referrals for a fee, reward or gain will be covered by regulation?</p>

<p><a name="06120573000035"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0001.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="06120573000106"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> We on the Liberal Democrat Benches give a broad welcome to the regulations. They provide for additional consumer protection in an area that has long been the subject of abuse. Some years ago, a Granada Television programme that conducted a sting operation on doctors who were providing bogus medical reports to claims farming organisation showed up an anomaly. The doctors were severely disciplined by the General Medical Council, but the claims farming agency was free from discipline and regulation. I hope that the orders will remedy that situation and provide increased consumer protection.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000036"></a>In relation to two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, we support the dual approach to insurance brokers, because we are talking in these regulations about consumer-accessible structures, much more so than the rather more strategic exercise carried out by the Financial Services Authority. It is extremely important that consumers who feel aggrieved and may well have a justifiable complaint can go to a regulator who is readily accessible to them in a simple way. So far as the regulation of those who refer the claim is concerned, we could go on regulating and regulating and regulating backwards, but surely the point of the exercise is to regulate those who process the claim on behalf of the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000037"></a>The complexity of all these regulations tends to justify the observation of an old-fashioned lawyer such as myself, who used to appear in many personal injury actions, that probably the best way to process any kind of claim, whether for personal injury,  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compensation for damage to a motor car, criminal injuries or anything similar, is to find a solicitor who is prepared to do the job for you, even on a conditional fee arrangement&#151;and do it in that way. It is self-evident that the simplest form of regulation is one-tier&#151;and that is the case in respect of solicitors. It is currently being changed, but there is a reasonable expectation that it will work.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000038"></a>In relation to solicitors, a compensation scheme does not exist at this stage in the structures set out under these regulations. I hope that the Minister can confirm that the Government at least intend that there should be the kind of compensation scheme available to people who suffer damage at the hands of solicitors. In my professional capacity, I have handled a few cases in which solicitors had acted either criminally or negligently, so I can tell the Committee that in many cases compensation is provided at a reasonable early stage. I recall one case in my last days as a Member of another place where substantial compensation was provided when there had been dishonesty in the conduct of some conveyancing several years earlier.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000039"></a>I would like to raise a few other points. Under one of the regulations, it is countenanced that fees will be payable and regulation available when people make claims for statutory benefits to which they are entitled as of right and as a matter of law. Certainly it is right that there should be regulation if people are rewarded for making such claims on a consumer&#146;s behalf. Would the Minister clarify the position of voluntary agencies such as citizens advice bureaux, because I have not been able to find the answer in my, albeit short, researches into these matters? If they carry out work of this kind, will they be subject to regulation and, if so, can that be justified as an extra tier of management for an already hard-pressed voluntary sector, bearing in mind that CABs will often advise people to go elsewhere if better services are available? However, sometimes it is difficult to find alternatives, particularly in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000040"></a>We hope that fee levels can be regulated so that, where statutory benefits are being claimed, it will not be possible for a large percentage of the return to be creamed off by the referral agency. Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority claims can be large, but it does not provide significant compensation for the cost of obtaining the compensation itself. We hope that the Minister will confirm that in such claims, which are routinely handled by solicitors and others, it is intended that the fee levels should take into account the statutory entitlement to the money being obtained and that that should be reflected at a low fee level.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000041"></a>The Minister said that it was intended that persons providing a regulated claims management service must have professional indemnity insurance in due course, but we regret that it is not being introduced immediately. If it is to be introduced only in time to come, there will be a difference between the use of a solicitor and the use of a claims management service, to the detriment of the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000042"></a>Finally, we hope that the Secretary of State will be regulator for only a short period, albeit with a structure beneath him. Regulation of claims of this kind may

The sooner it becomes a free-standing, independent body recognised as having the powers of other independent professional regulation bodies, the better it will be.</p>
<h5><a name="06120573000100"></a>4 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120573000043"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0001.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="06120573000107"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Carlile of Berriew, for their consideration and questions on these three orders. I shall attempt to answer their points. First, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked about overlapping regulations, and why insurance brokers should be regulated again. Where insurance brokers are providing a service regulated for the purposes of the Financial Services and MarketsAct 2000, they will be exempt. However, providing services for a claim concerning an uninsured loss is not a regulated activity under the 2000 Act. Insurance brokers will therefore require authorisation.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000044"></a>I could not agree more that the same activity should not be regulated twice. However, that does not mean that in some cases a particular business will need to be regulated by more than one regulator for different activities. We are working closely with the Financial Services Authority to ensure that the boundary issues that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, mentioned are appropriately dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000045"></a>The noble Lord also commented on introducers under Regulation 12(5)(c). The regulations will apply in limited circumstances, as set out in Article 12 of the exemption order. We will have an opportunity for a full debate on that early in the new year. A numberof introducers are exempt. Many businesses refer a small number of cases either to solicitors or claims management businesses. It would be disproportionate for such businesses to be individually authorised. However, it is important that all businesses comply with the rules of conduct. The exempt introducer status has been introduced to deal with thissituation.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, asks why the Government do not insist on professional indemnity insurance at the outset. It was clear from responses to a consultation exercise during the summer that, although there is general support for authorised persons to have professional indemnity insurance cover, there are concerns about some businesses&#146; difficulty in obtaining cover at a reasonable cost in such a short timeframe. The Government intend to require authorised persons to have professional indemnity insurance, but want to ensure that the requirement is appropriately introduced and that there is sufficient market capacity to provide the relevant insurance. It has therefore been decided not to introduce a blanket requirement at the outset; we instead favour a phased approach. We are undertaking more detailed work on this to establish the exact nature and level of the insurance requirement, and how best it could be phased in during 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, also asks about the citizens advice bureaux. I confirm that not-for-profit and charitable organisations providing claims advice will be exempt. Again, this will be debated in the new year with the exemption order.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000048"></a>The noble Lord also asks me to confirm that fees for criminal injuries and benefits claims will be prescribed. It is not intended that the regulator would prescribe or regulate fees which authorised persons may charge. However, authorised businesses will be required to operate transparently, including providing full information to consumers about the various charges and commissions paid when cases, insurance and loans are arranged in relation to consumers&#146; claims. Authorised persons must always act with honesty and integrity. This is a key principle of the conduct rules.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000049"></a>At the point of authorisation, the regulator will consider the applicant&#146;s practice or proposed practice in relation to the provision of information about fees. There will be firm rules of conduct. If companies break these rules of conduct, the regulator will take action, which can include suspension or cancellation of authorisation.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, asked for confirmation of a compensation scheme in respect of solicitors. A compensation scheme is already available to persons making complaints about solicitors. This regulation is not intended to apply to solicitors, as they are regulated by the Law Society.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000051"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0002.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06120573000108"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> I think that the Minister misunderstood my point and I am sure that it is my fault. I used the existence of the compensation scheme against solicitors as a justification for a similar scheme against people who come within the regulations. My question was whether it is intended that, in early course, a compensation fund should be established for clients of this group of professionals, just as there is a compensation scheme for clients of solicitors. I am afraid that that is what comes of reading someone else&#146;s note.</p>

We have a power under the Compensation Act to set up a compensation scheme for claims and regulation. However, as we made clear during the passage of the Bill, it would not be possible to set this up at the outset. The Legal Services Bill regime will ensure adequate compensation arrangements for all regulated areas.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000061"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is presented under Section 29 and Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. It will enable qualified Fellows of the Association of Law Costs Draftsmen to exercise limited rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation in England and Wales in connection with legal costs matters. A second order will be laid once this order has been made, extending the Legal Services Ombudsman&#146;s jurisdiction to oversee complaints against costs draftsmen.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000062"></a>The Association of Law Costs Draftsmen is the professional association representing and regulating law costs draftsmen working in England and Wales. Law costs draftsmen work in a small, highly specialised field. They draw up and analyse bills relating to all aspects of legal costs included in solicitors&#146; bills for cases in all courts. These costs can include the solicitor&#146;s fee, the court fees, barristers&#146; fees and expert and witness fees.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000063"></a>Preparation of such bills is highly specialised work and is almost always carried out by a costs draftsman rather than a solicitor. Solicitors usually prepare their own bills in only a minority of cases&#151;for example, those straightforward cases where the costs will be paid entirely by the solicitors&#146; own client and the legal costs are relatively low. Some costs draftsmen are employed full time by solicitors. Others work in partnership, as directors or employees of law costs drafting firms, or as freelancers on a partnership or sole practitioner basis.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000064"></a>Depending on the circumstances of each case, the costs set out in solicitors&#146; bills, prepared by law costs draftsmen, relate to cases heard in civil, criminal or family courts and will be paid by either the solicitors&#146; client, the client&#146;s opponent or public funds. Currently, costs draftsmen must seek the judge&#146;s approval to appear at costs hearings on a case by case basis. Members of the public cannot currently instruct a costs draftsman direct. Instructions must be channelled via a solicitor, who will then be responsible for the costs draftsman&#146;s conduct before the judge.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000065"></a>The Association of Law Costs Draftsmen seeks recognition as a body authorised to grant rights to its fellows to conduct litigation on behalf of clients in matters relating to legal costs, and to appear at legal costs hearings in all courts without having to seek the judge&#146;s permission. It wants clients to be able to instruct costs draftsmen direct rather than only via a solicitor. It also wants costs draftsmen to be authorised and regulated by their own professional association in all aspects of their work as law costs draftsmen rather than being under the supervision of solicitors in respect of their conduct at court as at present.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000066"></a>The rights sought will allow the association to grant rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation to suitably qualified fellows in respect of the assessment of the amount of costs payable in all courts and all types of case. This includes family, civil and criminal cases in all courts. It will apply irrespective of who will ultimately pay the legal costs claimed in the solicitors&#146; bill being assessed. Admittedly, this order will lead to only a small number of law costs draftsmen being able to exercise these rights&#151;some 500 over the next five to 10 years. But, from a competition point of view, it is important that they can do so.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000067"></a>Costs draftsmen will be able to act independently of solicitors in legal costs proceedings. This may simplify access to costs draftsmen&#146;s services and will potentially cut costs by enabling consumers to have direct access to the expertise of costs draftsmen, rather than being obliged to instruct and pay for a solicitor as well. Consumers and costs draftsmen will also benefit from the fact that costs draftsmen will be authorised and regulated directly by their own professional body with its expert knowledge of the specialist area involved, rather than indirectly via solicitors, who are not generally experts in this area.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000068"></a>The Legal Services Ombudsman has been consulted and has confirmed that she is willing for her jurisdiction to be extended to cover complaints against law costs draftsmen. Because of the very small numbers involved, it is anticipated that her office will receive approximately one complaint per year.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000069"></a>These orders have passed through the required statutory approval procedure. In doing so, they have been considered and approved by the Legal Services Consultative Panel, the Office of Fair Trading and the senior judiciary and, as a result, have my full support. If this order is approved, it is anticipated that the Legal Services Bill will be amended to include the ALCD on the list of approved regulators. I now commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000074"></a>The noble Lord said: These regulations make a number of minor technical but necessary changes to the Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) Regulations 2004&#151;the 2004 regulations. This is as a result of the changes introduced by the Electoral Administration Act 2006. When approved, these regulations will provide for the effective combination of a parliamentary election with another election or referendum.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000075"></a>These regulations revoke the provisions from the 2004 regulations that applied specifically to combined elections in June 2004 as they are no longer needed. They also revoke the prescribed form H from the 2004 regulations as a new form H&#151;the postal voting statement to be used when there is joint issue and receipt of postal ballots&#151;which has now been prescribed in the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, as amended by the Representation of the People (England and Wales) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2006. They provides for three further functions to be combined when there is joint issue and receipt of postal ballots, as a result of the changes introduced by the Electoral Administration Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000076"></a>The returning officer in charge of the combined functions will also have responsibility for the creation of a corresponding number list prescribed underRule 19A of the parliamentary elections rules; the creation of a marked postal voters list and proxy postal voters list under Rule 31A; and verification of personal identifiers on postal voting statements under Rule 45(1B)(d). It makes a number of modifications to the 2004 regulations to reflect changes made tothe parliamentary elections rules by the Electoral Administration Act. It amends the form of directions for guidance of voters at combined polls to provide improved clarity for voters; removes the specific reference to European parliamentary elections from the form of declaration to be made by the companion of a voter with disabilities; and replaces the reference to &#147;incapacity&#148; with a reference to &#147;disability&#148; to reflect the change of terminology introduced by the Electoral Administration Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000077"></a>The Government consulted the Electoral Commission on the draft of these regulations. The commission&#146;s detailed response is available on its website. The Government have taken on board the commission&#146;s comments in developing the draft. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000079"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06120573000115"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I have very little to say about these regulations because they implement discussions that we had during the passage of the Electoral Administration Act. However, I would like to clarify two matters. I do not think the Minister mentioned the part of the regulations that relates to the abandonment of one of the two polls. Paragraphs 27A and 27B refer to the death of a candidate, but paragraph 27 refers to the abandonment of part of a poll. I want to be clear that that is right.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000080"></a>I am not clear where the regulations refer to the requirement for identifiers for postal votes. If there is more than one election, people are presumably expected to have postal votes for each of them, but I not sure where these regulations make clear where and by whom those identifiers&#151;a signature and date of birth&#151;have to be checked. Apart from that, I am happy with these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000081"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0002.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="06120573000116"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I apologise for missing much of the Minister&#146;s speech. I was caught napping by the previous business happening rather quicker than forecast. Like the noble Baroness, we do not find anything to quibble about in these regulations. They are sensible and technical and carry through decisions that have been made about personal identifiers and other matters. We are looking forward to seeing how well the new security rules work.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000082"></a>These regulations repeal the rules that were made for the 2004 all-postal elections. We had some long debates on them. The debates were not bitter but were argumentative, and we marched through the lobbies a few times before the Government were able to hold those all-postal elections. We now seem to be in an era when all-postal elections have been abandoned. I hope that is the case, and it is welcome that the Government are nothing like as enthusiastic as they were about them.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000083"></a>I wish to make one or two detailed points, the first of which is on the issue of the ballot papers in a combined election. As I understand it, those of us who will not be allowed to have one type of ballot paper at a parliamentary election but can have a paper for a local election or referendum will be dealt with by having a strange squiggle or alternative mark put down on the corresponding number list and the marked register to show that we have had one type of ballot paper and not another. There are various categories like that. However, I presume that an elector who is entitled to two or three ballot papers at an election is entitled to refuse to accept one or more  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of them and to have simply the one he wants to vote on. Can the Minister tell us exactly what happens under those circumstances? The only time I have seen someone not want one, he ran out of the polling station, waving the ballot paper over his head and shouting a certain amount of abuse about it.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000084"></a>The last time we discussed this matter, underthe Representation of the People (Amendment) Regulations, the Minister told us about the system for signing in the polling station. There will be a machine to prevent people seeing the signatures of other people, which might potentially breach the secrecy of the ballot. What progress has been made in designing that apparatus and are the Government in a position to tell us how it will work? Clearly, the people involved in elections will need to be able to tell electors what to expect.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000085"></a>As far as the return of postal votes is concerned&#151;the regulations cover the situation in a combined election&#151;there will be sample security checks of at least 20 per cent of them. Will that include checks being done throughout the period in which votes are coming back, or will a returning officer be able to fulfil their 20 per cent quota by, for example, taking the first 20 per cent that come in and not taking the late ones? There might well be problems of delaying the count if there are lots of late postal votes. Some people might see an opportunity there for getting round the regulations and getting round the security and not having particular postal votes checked by putting them all in late at the last minute. Will that be possible?</p>

<p><a name="06120573000086"></a>Finally, one thing I picked up from reading the regulations is that where there are pilots for electronic counts, the voters will be asked not to fold their ballot paper. Normally if you go to a polling station, you are asked to fold the ballot paper in two, so that when you put it into the box no one can see the top side of it and therefore they cannot see how you have voted. If you do not fold it, how do you get it into the ballot box without people being able to see how you voted? There seems to be a problem with secrecy there. With those detailed questions, I am happy to support the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000087"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0002.htm_spnew98"></a><a name="06120573000117"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am grateful to the two noble Lords for their comments on the regulations. I will answer the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, first. She asked about what happens in the event of the abandonment of a poll. Where the poll at a parliamentary election is abandoned due to the death of a candidate, the regulations provide that the poll&#151;at an election that is combined with that election; for example, a local government election&#151;will continue. Secondly, do people have to have identifiers for both elections, and where and by whom are they checked? On the issue of receipt of postal ballots at a parliamentary election that is combined with another election, the returning officer for the parliamentary election will be responsible for checking identifiers. The noble Baroness asked about marked postal voters list. The postal voters list will be marked when the postal voting statement has been received. The elector will be informed that it has been either received or provisionally rejected.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000088"></a>I have answers coming through on the detailed questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. On postal voter identifiers, the answer is yes. That is nice and short. He also asked about pilots for electronic counts and voters being asked not to fold the ballot paper. That provision will be in a pilot order that is accurate, and an e-count result can be achieved. I think that the noble Lord asked a few more questions, and I will write to him if that is all right.</p>

<p><a name="06120573000089"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0002.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="06120573000118"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The Minister has been good enough to answer about folding the ballot paper. I understand the reason for that&#151;which I assume is to make it easier for it to be counted electronically. The point I made is that, as I understand it, they will not be voting electronically, they will be voting in the normal way on a piece of paper, and those pieces of paper will then be counted electronically. If you do not fold your ballot paper, someone on one side or other of the person putting it in the ballot box will be able to see how you have voted. How will that be prevented?</p>

<p><a name="06120577000007"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful to the Committee for having a temporary adjournment because it was enormously important that the Minister was presenting awards to the poultry industry. As that is where I started my trade, many years ago, as a poultry

I place on record, too, my thanks to the Minister for reconsidering the whole question of the IPCC charges because they are a real problem, on which I and many others have lobbied him.</p>

<p><a name="06120577000008"></a>Having started on a positive note, I am sorry to have to nitpick and raise certain questions. I suggest that we take these two sets of regulations together. Statutory Instrument 2006/2362 was made on 4 September, laid before Parliament on 7 September and came into force on 1 October. Statutory Instrument 2006/2522 was made on 13 September, when it was realised that there were errors in the first one, laid on 15 September and came into force on 30 September, but some remaining provisions came through on 10 October. Perhaps the Minister will tell us a little more on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="06120577000009"></a>My reasons for raising this issue before in Committee today are to seek clarification and assurance, and also to say, yet again, that the department is obviously not functioning as the Minister would like it to. To have to reproduce legislation so quickly after it has come into being seems undesirable, to say the least. How many copies of the original were made and how many were sold at &#163;5.50? Consequently, how much money has been spent on reproducing the regulations? Presumably, there is a cost to the department which it covers.</p>

<p><a name="06120577000010"></a>With regard to Regulations 23 to 31, how much money does Natural England have in its budget to act as the enforcement authority? That is certainly not clear. Is the amount that it will cost Natural England to be taken out of the fees that it gets from the fines that may follow if people do not adhere to the regulations set? There is no clear definition of that. Also, does Natural England keep the fines or do they return to the revenue so that, in other words, they are lost?</p>

<p><a name="06120577000011"></a>Under Regulation 3.1, the Explanatory Memorandum for SI 2006/2522 states:</p>
<ul><a name="06120577000026"></a>&#147;The Department deeply regrets that it has had to break the 21-day rule&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000017"></a>I can understand that it broke it because otherwise the other regulation would come into force. But Regulation 3.3 leaves us with a very sorry state of affairs. It states clearly:<ul><a name="06120577000027"></a>&#147;In order to correct a minor but persistent validation error in the S.I. template, a final draft of those Regulations was cut out and pasted into a fresh copy of the template. The new version validated correctly, but the cut-and-paste process had introduced an unexpected error into the instrument, mis-numbering all the paragraphs in Schedules 3 to 5. This was noticed after the instrument was made, and it was considered an error that was so obvious and minor that it could justifiably be corrected before the instrument was laid&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000018"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum goes on to state:<ul><a name="06120577000028"></a>&#147;Unfortunately, the correction of that minor error introduced a surprising and yet more serious error into the instrument, with regulation 1 becoming regulation 2 ... leading to consequential errors in the Regulations ... Most regrettably of all, that further re-numbering error was not noticed until after the instrument had been laid and printed&#148;,</ul><a name="06120577000019"></a>That is not a happy state of affairs. Is that a lawyers&#146; or a printers&#146; error, because we have no knowledge of that?

<p><a name="06120577000012"></a>The summary of the recommendations of the46th Report from the Merits Committee of the 2005-06 Session states:</p>
<ul><a name="06120577000029"></a>&#147;These Regulations implement EU legislation on environmental impact assessment, and on habitats, by developing existing requirements for projects for the use of uncultivated land and semi-natural areas for intensive agricultural purposes. They also introduce new rules for projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings. The lack of clarity over the definition of restructuring projects in the Regulations means that there is a risk of accidental non-compliance (and thus commission of a criminal offence) by farmers and others&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000020"></a>So it is not a light matter.
<p><a name="06120577000013"></a>Further on, at paragraph 8, the Merits Committee states that Defra was,</p>
<ul><a name="06120577000033"></a>&#147;keen to choose a broad interpretation of the restructuring projects, particularly because the new rules being introduced under EU infraction pressure&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000021"></a>Paragraph 9 goes on to state:<ul><a name="06120577000030"></a>&#147;The Department will also include details of new rules and guidance to all farmers on &#147;cross-compliance&#148; (planned for January 2007)&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000022"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could update us about where we are with that. However, in paragraph 10, the committee states:<ul><a name="06120577000031"></a>&#147;While we welcome DEFRA&#146;s efforts to publicise the new rules, we are not persuaded that publicity will necessarily equate to understanding&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000023"></a>Again, I would like to know how the Government have reacted to that.
<p><a name="06120577000014"></a>In paragraph 11 the committee states:</p>
<ul><a name="06120577000032"></a>&#147;DEFRA have stressed that interpretation of the term &#147;restructuring project&#148; in the 2006 Regulations should be in line with the meaning of the relevant term in the EIA directive; and yet it is clear from the Department&#146;s advice to this Committee that different Member States have interpreted this term in the EIA Directive differently. DEFRA have explained that Natural England, as the regulator with responsibility for screening decisions and consents, is ready to provide informal advice to farmers and land managers. However, it does not seem appropriate to us that uncertainties which should have been resolved in the Regulations themselves are left to be dealt with on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis through discussions between Natural England and individuals potentially affected&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000024"></a>I seek a little more information from the Minister on that.
<p><a name="06120577000015"></a>The committee states in conclusion inparagraph 12 that it is concerned that,</p>
<ul><a name="06120577000034"></a>&#147;the lack of clarity over the definition of restructuring projects means that there is a risk of accidental non-compliance (and thus the commission of a criminal offence) by farmers and others&#148;.</ul><a name="06120577000025"></a>I am sure that the Minister will agree that that is not a desirable state to be in, and that is why I have brought this issue to the attention of the Grand Committee. I shall wait to hear what other noble Lords and the Minister have to say and shall perhaps come back with further comments. I beg to move.

<p><a name="06120584000009"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0003.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="06120584000182"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Perhaps it is a good thing that I did not hear that. There are some substantive issues here which are worth looking at. As the noble Baroness said, the regulations re-enact and amend the regulations in relation to uncultivated land and introduce regulations, belatedly perhaps, in relation to restructuring projects on farms. The substantial matter raised by the Merits Committee, which the noble Baroness explained in detail, is the possible lack of clarity about the definition of restructuring projects. It also expressed concern about whether there will be sufficient publicity, and understanding on the part of farmers and land managers, about the requirements of the new regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000010"></a>Defra states that Natural England will provide informal advice, but if one is looking for a clear definition of what something means in law, and it can clearly make a substantial difference to what a farmer or land manager is able to do with their land, informal advice is not entirely satisfactory. What will that advice be and who will decide it?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000011"></a>The regulatory functions in these matters have been transferred from the Rural Development Service in Defra to Natural England. As in all such cases, there is an interesting question of accountability. A lot of people will be monitoring this very carefully. The new arrangements may work, but, if they do not, no doubt we will all be discussing them again.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000012"></a>One or two specific questions arise from the regulations. The first relates to cross-compliance. The regulations relating to uncultivated land are alreadyin the cross-compliance rules and appear againin, I believe, Rule 37. However, the restructuring regulations will not be in the cross-compliance rules. It is stated quite clearly that they will not be included. I do not understand why this is the case. Perhaps the Minister will explain it to my satisfaction.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000013"></a>The second question relates to publicity. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer would no doubt raise it if she we here, because it relates to website publicity. Quite a few years ago, when we were talking about the CROW Bill, as it then was, whenever the Bill said that there had to be publicity in local newspapers and so on, my noble friend tabled amendments saying, &#147;and on the departmental website&#148;. The answer we always had then, and that we have had on a number of occasions since in different  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contexts, was &#147;leave it to them, it will be okay&#148;. We are now finding, and it is in these regulations as well, that the requirement to be on the website is being written into the law. We welcome that, because that how so many people communicate nowadays. Local newspapers are set out specifically, and websites should be set out specifically. We have an interesting situation here. Regulations 12 and 13 set out that applications for consent for significant projects, as they are called, should be in the local newspaperand on the website. Regulation 20, which covers where the decisions are announced, only specifies local newspapers,</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000169"></a>&#147;or by any other means it considers reasonable in the circumstances&#148;.</ul><a name="06120584000145"></a>So what we seem to have here is a halfway house where the websites are in one part of the regulations but not in the other. It would be helpful if there was consistency in these matters. We hope that, increasingly, legislation sets out that it does have to be on the website, because that is where nowadays a lot of people look first.
<p><a name="06120584000014"></a>Finally, I hope that the regulations might be useful in the circumstances in parts of the uplands, including the Pennines, where I live, where there are sometimes serious threats to dry stone walls. People find that the income that they can get from hill farming is no longer worth the candle, but they can tear down and sell off the dry stone walls of natural stone for quite large amounts of money. There is a real danger that if hill farming declines significantly under the new regime&#151;we all hope it will not but there is a possibility that it might&#151;people will try to asset-strip those marginal farms on the edges of the moorlands in the upland areas, and the dry stone walls will be removed and sold off for astronomical prices to builders. I hope that the regulations might be useful in stopping that. Having said that, in general we support the regulations, and I look forward to hearing the answers to my questions and those asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000015"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0003.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="06120584000183"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I will be happy to try to answer the points raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. There is one minor technical glitch. Both the noble Baroness and the Deputy Chairman read out that the Committee will report that it has considered the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) Regulations. Neither mentioned the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) (No. 2) Regulations. I would hate to find that we have spent our time here and have to do it again.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000018"></a>The regulations implement parts of the environmental impact assessment directive, which is a very old directive that was introduced in 1985. There is a story to that, which I will repeat in a moment. The directive requires certain types of development projects that are likely to have significant effects on the environment to be subject to environmental impact assessments before they are allowed to proceed. The directive applies to more than 100 different types of project. In the UK, it is implemented mainly through environmental impact assessment rules relating to town and country planning. There are various EIA rules for projects not covered by the planning system, such as transport and forestry projects, and the two types of project to which the EIA agriculture rules apply.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000019"></a>The Environmental Impact Assessment Agriculture (England) Regulations came into force on 10 October 2006. They are a small but significant part of our effort to protect and enhance the rural environment, alongside much larger measures such as agri-environment schemes, SSSIs and cross compliance. The regulations do two things: they replace previous environmental impact assessment rules, which were introduced in 2001, applying to projects for the use of uncultivated land and semi-natural areas for intensive agricultural purposes and they introduce new rules applying to projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000020"></a>We are legally obliged by the environmentalimpact assessment directive to have these rules, and we were required to introduce them by 1988. ButUK transposition did not occur until 2001 for uncultivated land and 2006 for rural restructuring following infraction pressure. I do not want to be part of the blame culture, but there is a history to this. This has been done under infraction pressures, and the regulations have perhaps not ended up as they would have if they had been done properly when they were required to be done in 1988. We thought that they were delayed largely because the policy issues were already addressed by agri-environment schemes, hedgerows legislation and the SSSI rules.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000021"></a>In 2001, Defra introduced environmental impact assessment rules on uncultivated land. They gave a high degree of protection to uncultivated land and semi-natural areas, mainly by having no thresholds, which meant that all relevant projects needed permission before proceeding. Generally speaking, we have a good story to tell on the 2006 regulations&#151;I do not want to over-egg the pudding, but this is a good Defra story for the farming community&#151;which were developed with better regulation and Defra&#146;s farming regulation strategy very much in mind.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000022"></a>The objectives in shaping the regulations were to deliver targeted environmental protection while minimising red tape and to avoid hindering our wider policy objectives. Poorly gauged rules could do more harm than good by deterring farmers from signing up to agri-environment schemes or deterring work that is beneficial to the environment. They might also restrict farmers&#146; ability to diversify their businesses and compete and have a negative effect on the rural land market. We are very keen to take away some of the hurdles that prevent farmers diversifying if we can. As the noble Baroness knows, I am having issues related to planning matters looked at at present.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000023"></a>We improved the uncultivated land rules by introducing clearer tests for when projects are caught and by introducing a modest two hectare thresholdto give the rules a lighter touch, while still providing a fairly high level of protection for a valuable environmental resource. We estimate that the revised rules will place 20 to 40 per cent less burden on business than the rules they replace.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000024"></a>We introduced the rural restructuring rules under EC infraction pressure. In doing this, we have done all we can to achieve minimum implementation by applying the highest thresholds we reasonably can, given the infraction risk. We have also sought to avoid duplication of existing measures which tackle problematic restructuring, such as the hedgerows regulations and other environmental impact assessment rules applying to planning and forestry. The result is that we have new rules that guard against the possibility of major negative effects on the rural landscape, but will not catch farmers engaged in routine farming activities, which is not our purpose at all.</p>
<h5><a name="06120584000173"></a>5.15 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120584000025"></a>It may shock the noble Baroness that we have had a generally&#151;I do not put it any higher than this&#151;positive response from the National Farmers Union. The NFU website celebrates that it:</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000165"></a>&#147;Successfully lobbied government for the introduction of thresholds into the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations 2006. This will mean that fewer farmers should have to go through the EIA screening process unnecessarily&#148;.</ul><a name="06120584000146"></a>That is quite right. Congratulations for the lobbying that has gone on in the past. It is very important that we genuinely try to take account of the red tape issue.
<p><a name="06120584000026"></a>I also want to address some of the issues relating to the Merits Committee. Briefly, the rules work by requiring that anyone wishing to carry out a project must apply to Natural England for a &#147;screening decision&#148;. If Natural England decides the project is likely to have a significant effect on the environment, the environmental impact assessment must be prepared by the applicant before Natural England makes a final consent decision. People who breach the rules may face cross-compliance deductions, prosecution, and/or have to take remedial action. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised an issue about stone walls covered by cross compliance or possible deductions for removers over 10 metres. He painted a horrible scenario of what might happen in the uplands, which would not be in anyone&#146;s interests.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000027"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said that she had come to nitpick today&#151;her words, not mine. I do not accuse the noble Baroness of that. I cannot answer all her questions about why the regulations were redone. Obviously, it is much to be regretted that a computer glitch confused the cross-referencing in the initial EIA regulations, so we had to replace them with a corrected set. The rules of a statutory instrument have to be produced compared to a computerised template, in effect, so that the format is the same. The glitch caused the automatic numbering to make an unbidden change at the last moment, which made all the cross-referencing incorrect. Unfortunately, we did not spot the error until a few  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>days after the regulations had been laid. Statutory instruments cannot be amended. There is a case for this House to be able to do that, but I have not come here to do revolutionary reform today. Therefore, we had to lay the corrected version&#151;hence, the No. 2 regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000028"></a>We replaced them free of charge to those people who had paid for them. I do not know how many were distributed. If the noble Baroness pushes me I will seek to find out how many and at what cost. That would cause extra cost to the department, but she is entitled to the answers to the question. On the money for Natural England, 9.4 staff years are budgeted, but, by the way, the fines do not pay for the regulations, which would not be normally the case.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000029"></a>The Merits Committee has expressed concerns on the regulations. The main concerns were that the regulations failed to give a sufficiently clear definition of the term,</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000170"></a>&#147;projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings&#148;</ul><a name="06120584000147"></a>and, as a result, there was a risk of accidental non-compliance and commission of a criminal offence by farmers and others. 
<p><a name="06120584000030"></a>On the way we defined projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings, the committee&#146;s concern is valid to the extent that we cannot guarantee that farmers will fail to comply accidentally, which is the case with many offences in many laws. To answer the Merits Committee&#146;s concerns, we are bound by the environmental impact assessment directive introduced in 1985, which does not define what projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings means. In transposing the legislation we decided to follow the common practice of simply using the same wording as the directive without further elaboration. This is done, for example, in environmental impact assessment rules on the planning system and forestry. It is also the norm in other EU countries&#151;for example, Irish and Dutch environmental impact assessment rules take the same approach.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000031"></a>Although we have not resolved what is meant by,</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000171"></a>&#147;projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings&#148;,</ul><a name="06120584000148"></a>in our transposing legislation, we have done so in our implementation. For example, we have explained the term in the accompanying guidance. We feel it is reasonable to expect land managers to understand and apply this definition. We consulted the NFU on this, to ensure that the guidance was as user-friendly as possible, and the NFU approved it before it was issued. There may have been a transparency problem if we had set a low threshold, which is one reason we set high thresholds. It does not seem unreasonable to require a person to realise that planning work on the scale of removing or adding more than four kilometres of field boundaries is not a minor job&#151;four kilometres of field boundaries is quite an exercise if one is out there doing it, and I have seen it being done. Nor is removing more than 10,000 tonnes&#151;about 400 large lorry loads of earth or rock. These are substantial jobs by any stretch of the imagination. It is not like, &#147;I&#146;m nipping out to knock this job off in half a day, dear, and I&#146;ll be back&#148;.  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000032"></a>The guidance gives details of a Natural England telephone helpline, and other contact details. If managers are in any doubt, they are advised to contact them. It is important to publicise the regulations, which we have done. I was almost tempted to say, &#147;I have got all this written down, put together by my fine officials, who have explained all this, the background and why it is a good news story to me&#148;. However, a front-page article in Defra&#146;s October <I>Farming Link</I> newspaper, sent out to all farmers, set it out in clear, tabloid language&#151;I do not say that in a derogatory way&#151;which gets the meat across to anyone interested in half a dozen bullet points. At the end, there is the helpline, and email and website addresses. If farmers did nothing but read that, the new rules to protect the countryside and the issues I have raised about the four kilometres and 10,000 tonnes are mentioned there. Our press notice was picked up by the farming press as well, so it did not get buried or die a death. Both the NFU and CLA have issued guidance to members on their own websites, and we have published straightforward guidance on the Defra website.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000033"></a>The Merits Committee asked why we chose to make a criminal offence of breaching the restructuring rules. For the avoidance of doubt, we did this because we considered it an effective way of ensuring compliance and making the rules enforceable. It reduces the risk of placing the UK in breach of the directive, which would happen if unnotified and unpermitted projects had significant effects on the environment, and is in the interests of consistency and proportionality. A criminal offence existed in the 2001 regulations, and we plan to keep it for uncultivated land projects. So why would we consider it a criminal offence to fail to give screening permission for an uncultivated land project, but not a restructuring one? As I said, the restructuring must be quite large.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000034"></a>We do not expect many to undertake restructuring projects exceeding the high thresholds we have set. It is early days. After the first two months of the regulations, no screening applications have been received to undertake restructuring projects. We expect that trend to continue, because the high thresholds exclude routine land management activities which farmers are rightly doing all the while. That would be normal, whereas what I have outlined is on a large scale. Most restructuring over the threshold will be exempt, because it will already be covered by existing legislation: the environmental impact assessment rules applying to the planning system, forestry, land drainage and water resources, the hedgerow regulations and the Law of Property Act.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000035"></a>We have asked Natural England to implement the rules with a light touch. Frankly, I give all Defra&#146;s agencies that advice: see the rules are followed, but do not go over the top. We do not want farmers, or people working on the land, metaphorically trapped by barbed wire and wrapped up in red tape. We are trying to release them from that where we can. People will suffer a criminal penalty only if they are prosecuted and convicted by a court, so it not an issue of being done by Defra officials. Any prosecution would of course have to satisfy the public interest test.

<p><a name="06120584000036"></a>This is basically a good news story, subject to the unfortunate glitch. We are prone to using computers; if you press the wrong key or there is a problem with the program, these things happen. It was unfortunate that it was not spotted. I am not in the blame game; I just want to get on with it and see that they are operating effectively, but we regret this. On the recent difficulties, I say to the noble Baroness that this issue appeared nowhere in any of my lists of the cause of the technical adjustment to Defra&#146;s budget this year. It has not been on the scale of other issues.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000037"></a>Finally, I am grateful to be able to answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on why rural restructuring is not covered by cross compliance. The short answer is that we were keen to avoid increasing the burden of cross compliance. The new rules are designed to have a light touch, so are intended to catch only a small number of projects, whereas cross compliance already covers some ofthe ground dealt with in the regulations. The benefits of extending cross compliance to cover rural restructuring projects were so small that it was not worth doing. I have no doubt I could give the noble Lord a longer answer, but I hope and imagine that he will be satisfied with that one.</p>

He said I was nit-picking, but it has given us an opportunity to debate something important and, obviously, regulations which we support. Perhaps I should keep a list of how many times the Minister has to apologise for things going wrong in his department, but we will let that one pass. I certainly never suggested, as he well knows, that it was a contributor to Defra&#146;s funding issues. I totally accept that.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000039"></a>I am grateful that the Minister updated us on how Defra has gone about putting it on the newsletter, along with the two other organisations. When he hopes that Natural England will deal with it with a light touch&#151;we have not had anybody apply, but let us say that it is a problem in future&#151;can the Minister clarify further whether Natural England will be the last port of call, or will the farmer or land manager held to account have any redress, either through the department or Natural England? I am always uneasy about something that makes somebody guilty unless you can prove that they are innocent. Here we are again, doing just that.</p>

This one, however, we felt that we should. Before I finally sit down, I again seek clarification on something I have raised.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000042"></a>The committee referred to different members states looking at this regulation in different ways. Is the Minister satisfied that it will in no way disadvantage UK producers or land managers, compared with others throughout the EU? I support flexibility to a certain extent, but I do not want to see flexibility disadvantaging UK producers and land managers.</p>

I shall take advice and perhaps write to the noble Baroness on that, but if matters are left to member states things will be done slightly differently in each. On the other hand, if there is rigidity from Brussels, everyone will complain, &#147;It doesn&#146;t suit our local circumstances&#148;. I said that we were following a similar pattern to, for example, Ireland and the Netherlands in the way that we used the lack of a definition in the regulations. We simply transposed the same words in the directive, because that was the legally safe way of doing it. But if there is a relevant issue relating to the treatment of the regulations by different European countries, I shall gladly write to the noble Baroness.</p>

At the beginning of the debate I referred to the Minister&#146;s presentation of the awards downstairs. One of the issues raised was the whole question of the IPPC charges. The Minister has recognised that there are difficulties on that for our producers and said he will go away and think about how we can ensure that we are not disadvantaging UK producers.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000045"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0004.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06120584000191"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Perhaps I may save myself from writing a letter. In answer to the question of why UK regulations are tougher than those in other member states, the restructuring rules are a very light touch, given that we transposed them much later thanother member states. One of our problems is that, from 1988, we in this country did nothing for nearly15 years. That is probably the root cause of our problem, because we did that under infraction pressure and the European Court of Justice case law emphasised the need to interpret the directive broadly. Infractions are brought against member states that define the directive too narrowly, so the UK opted for a broad interpretation.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000046"></a>The uncultivated land and semi-natural area rules are tougher here than in most member states because we wanted to protect valuable areas that were not already protected by environmental designations following the major loss of uncultivated and semi-natural areas during the 20th century. We introduced thresholds to the rules in light of the reduced threat to uncultivated land and semi-natural areas following CAP reforms and the rapidly expanding agri-environment schemes. That is the reason. In some ways it goes back to what was done under infraction pressures after we did nothing from 1988 to 2001. Then we got caught and had to deal with it in that way.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000052"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0004.htm_spnew119"></a><a name="06120584000194"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Personal Injuries (NHS Charges) (Amounts) Regulations 2006. <I>2nd Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee and 2nd Report from the Merits Committee.</I></p>

<p><a name="06120584000053"></a>The noble Baroness said: For 70 years, hospitals have had the right to recover the costs of treating people injured in road accidents where the victim has been paid injury compensation. The NHS costs are borne by the compensator, rather than by the accident victim or the hospital. The principle is that those responsible for causing injury to others should pay the full cost of their actions or negligence, including the cost of treating the victim&#146;s injuries. Under the existing Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999, the costs are recovered centrally and then paid back directly to the NHS trusts that provided the treatment.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000054"></a>The road traffic Act scheme has so far paid some &#163;300 million to hospitals in Britain for them to reinvest in front-line patient care. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards)Act 2003 took the powers to extent recovery of NHS costs to cases involving personal injury compensation generally. It does not seem logical that the successful road traffic Act scheme should be restricted to motor accidents. Therefore, it will not be restricted to motor accidents when the new scheme comes into force early in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000055"></a>When a person receives compensation for an injury, the costs of any NHS hospital treatment and ambulances in connection with the injury will be recoverable from whoever has paid the compensation. The income raised from the new injury cost recovery scheme will be paid straight back to the hospitals that  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provided the treatment. Those hospitals will be free to use the money to improve patient services as theysee fit. In that way, we hope to recover an additional &#163;150 million to be reinvested in front-line patient care.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000056"></a>These regulations make provision concerning the amounts of NHS charges to be recovered under the injury costs recovery scheme from people who pay compensation in cases where an injured person receives NHS hospital treatment or ambulance services. As well as setting the tariffs for outpatient and inpatient treatment, the provision of NHS ambulance services and the maximum amount to be recovered in relation to any one injury, these regulations also set out how the injury costs recovery scheme is to deal with a range of circumstances in which the amounts to be recovered may need to be adjusted.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000057"></a>These regulations are made using for the first time powers under section 153(2) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. The Act requires the first regulations made under these powers to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Act also requires the Secretary of State to consult the National Assembly for Wales before making regulations under Part 3 of the 2003 Act. As these regulations are made under Part 3, consultation has taken place. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, has made the following statement regarding Human Rights:</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000166"></a>&#147;In my view the provisions of the Personal Injuries (NHS Charges) (Amounts) Regulations 2006 are compatible with the Convention rights&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06120584000058"></a>Part 3 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 makes provision for the establishment of a scheme to recover the costs of providing treatment to an injured person where that person has made a successful personal injury compensation claim against a third party. The injury costs recovery scheme builds on the existing scheme introduced by the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999&#151;the RTA scheme&#151;which allows costs to be recovered in road traffic accident cases only. The new injury costs recovery scheme will come into force on 29 January 2007.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000059"></a>The injury costs recovery scheme will be administered by the Department for Work and Pension&#146;s Compensation Recovery Unit&#151;CRU&#151;on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health. The CRU has operated the current RTA scheme since 1999, and has extensive links with, for example, solicitors and insurers. The person found liable to any extent in respect of the injury will also be liable to pay the relevant NHS charges in respect of NHS hospital treatment and ambulance services, in so far as provided. Compensators will have a legal obligation to inform the CRU of any claim for personal injury compensation.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000060"></a>Under the existing RTA scheme the amounts to be recovered are set using a simple tariff system. The tariff consists of a single one-off payment where hospital treatment is provided without admission, currently &#163;505, or a daily rate, currently &#163;620, for each day or part day of admission to hospital, excluding the day of discharge. There is also a statutory ceiling on how  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much can be recovered in relation to treatment of injuries resulting from any one incident&#151;currently &#163;37,100, or roughly 60 days&#146; in-patient treatment. These amounts have been migrated to the injury costs recovery scheme, with the addition of a new element to cover the cost of any ambulance journeys that may be required. This has been set at &#163;159. Regulation 2 of these regulations sets out the amounts of NHS charges payable.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000061"></a>The tariff system means, of course, that frequently the amounts recovered do not match exactly the costs of providing treatment in any specific case. The tariffs represent average treatment costs; all these amounts have been established by calculating the average cost of treatment for injuries typically suffered in accidents and, for ambulance journeys, the average costs of providing ambulance services. These amounts are not intended to provide exact reimbursement.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000062"></a>Under the RTA scheme the tariffs are uprated annually on 1 April in line with NHS inflation. The increase is calculated using an average amount based on the three most recent years for which figures are known. The intention is to retain the annual uprating exercise but the tariff will not be uprated on 1 April 2007, given that the scheme will only recently have been introduced.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000063"></a>These regulations also set out how the ICR scheme is to deal with a range of circumstances where the amounts to be recovered may need to be adjusted. For example, the regulations make provision for where more than one person is liable to pay the NHS charges in respect of the same injury. Regulation 5 provides for the liability to pay the charges to be apportioned by the Secretary of State between two or more compensators. Naturally, there has to be adjustment for cross-border cases. Regulation 6 covers the adjustment of a certificate of NHS charges where the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers both issue certificates. This could apply, for example, when an injured person has received treatment in both a hospital in England and a hospital in Scotland. </p>

<p><a name="06120584000064"></a>If the amount specified in the certificates when aggregated exceeds the maximum amount&#151;currently &#163;37,100&#151;the Secretary of State may adjust any amount specified in the certificate issued by her. Regulations 7 to 10 make provision for the repayment of overpayments of charges and the recovery of underpayment of charges, including provision requiring the Secretary of State to send out statements showing the amount of overpayment or underpayment and the action required. If, as a result of a redetermination, adjustment, review or repeal, it appears that the amount of NHS charges paid by any person is more than the amount that ought to have been paid, the Secretary of State will either pay the difference to the person who paid the NHS charges, or instruct the trust or body to pay the difference to the person who paid the NHS charges.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000065"></a>Where the Secretary of State pays the difference, she will instruct the relevant NHS body to pay the difference to her or deduct it from future payments to that NHS body. If it appears that the amount of NHS charges paid by any person is less than the amount that ought to have been paid, the person who paid the relevant NHS charges will pay the difference to the  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State, who will then pay that difference to the relevant NHS body. Where an underpayment or overpayment occurs, the Secretary of State will send a statement to the person paying NHS charges and the relevant NHS body, setting out the details, including details of the revised amount of NHS charges.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000066"></a>In summary, these regulations extend the scheme that allows the NHS to recoup the cost of treating the victims of road traffic accidents to include all cases where an injured person has made a successful claim for personal injury compensation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000067"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do reportto the House that it has considered the Personal Injuries (NHS Charges) (Amounts) Regulations 2006. <I>2nd Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee and 2nd Report from the Merits Committee.&#151;</I>(<I>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="06120584000068"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0004.htm_spnew120"></a><a name="06120584000195"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations. The regulations look routine and rather dull, but they are not. They are the latest manifestation of the Government&#146;s push to levy indirect taxes on the public through the medium of higher insurance premiums and, in so doing, effectively to introduce new charges for NHS treatment, which they have consistently denied that they would ever do. They have done so twice, as the Minister explained. Provision was made in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 for NHS hospitals to receive reimbursement for the cost of treating those people who have suffered a personal injury and have been compensated under an insurance policy. That measure represented an extension of the scheme introduced by the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999, under which all hospitals treating victims of road accidents would be reimbursed by motor insurers for the cost of doing so. </p>

<p><a name="06120584000069"></a>It has taken some time for the Government to lay regulations to implement the extended scheme. The reason was apparently the concern expressed during the consultation exercise about whether the employers&#146; liability compulsory insurance market was sufficiently robust to cope with the additional demands to be made on it. The Government undertook not to put the scheme in place until they had carried out a study of the ELCI market. The study was published in late 2003, and it recommended that the new injury cost recovery scheme be postponed for a year.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000070"></a>A year later, there was another public consultation, which again excited concerns about the fragility of the ELCI market. Therefore, the first issue on which I should appreciate reassurance from the Minister is whether her department is absolutely satisfied that the ELCI market is now stable and strong enough to sustain the impact of the new ICR scheme. If it is so satisfied, I should be grateful to know the grounds on which it has reached that conclusion. What sums of money do the Government believe that the NHS will recover from the scheme once it is fully operational, if one excludes the amounts to be collected from motor insurers under the existing scheme? What will be the costs of collection?</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000071"></a>At present, claims against motor insurers are collected on behalf of NHS trusts by the Compensation Recovery Unit in the Department for Work and Pensions. Can the Minister confirm that the CRU will also be charged with the work entailed by this order? I believe that she said that that was the case. If I am correct about that, can she tell me why the contract has not been put out to competitive tender? Why have the Government not sought to achieve best value? If they believe that the CRU represents best value, how do they know?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000072"></a>I ask those questions somewhat pointedly because when the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act was brought into force in 1999, no competitive tendering was done then either, despite the fact that the Government had previously issued 12 guiding principles for market testing and contracting out. They stated:</p>
<ul><a name="06120584000167"></a>&#147;The choice of the means to deliver best value for money, should be based on a robust assessment of the options in each set of circumstances ... Departments should regularly and systematically review what services they provide and how they are delivered to ensure better quality services at optimal cost&#148;.</ul><a name="06120584000149"></a>Are those guiding principles still applicable today? If so, can the Minister confirm that a review of the performance of the CRU has been carried out and that Ministers have concluded, on the basis of an objective assessment, that the in-house route offers best value for money?
<p><a name="06120584000150"></a>The Government&#146;s conduct in 1999 was particularly reprehensible. For a number of years, the National Road Traffic Accident Claims Centre, NARTRACC, a company run by Mr Frank Adlam, had been collecting fees from motor insurers for the cost of treating victims of road traffic accidents in NHS hospitals under Section 157 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. NARTRACC was engaged by 132 hospitals in the UK to undertake that work and was extremely successful in doing so. In 1996, and again after the election in 1997, Mr Adlam approached the Government to propose that the reimbursement scheme should be rolled out nationally and, through his Member of Parliament, passed extensive amounts of advice to the Department of Health on how that might be achieved to the best advantage of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000151"></a>The Government decided to legislate. The legislation passed in 1999 put NARTRACC out of business without a penny of compensation. Its entire workforce was made redundant. Mr Adlam received not so much as a thank you from Ministers who, from that point on, refused to see him. Had NARTRACC lost out after a competitive tender, that would have been one thing, but no tender for the work was ever issued. The collection work was placed in-house. That decision by Mr Frank Dobson, the then Secretary of State, has never satisfactorily been explained.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000152"></a>NARTRACC submitted an indicative quote to the Department of Health which showed that it would be able to collect fees at a much lower cost than the CRU. It was ignored. Mr Adlam has asked for sight of the background papers supplied to the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he made his Budget announcement in 1997 about the national roll-out of NHS charges. He was told, almost unbelievably, that no such papers existed. He has asked the Department  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Health for sight of policy advice submitted toMr Dobson when the decision was made not to market test. The department has refused to release the papers on grounds of cost. When Mr Adlam offered to pay the additional cost, he was told that that was not allowed.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000153"></a>Considering that government legislation brought Mr Adlam&#146;s legitimate business to an end, it would not have taken much to provide him with some measure of compensation, in accordance with the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights. Fur farmers were put out of business by government legislation at very much the same time and provision was made to compensate them. Mr Adlam, whose company provided a public service to the NHS, was kicked out into the cold.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000154"></a>The whole story of NARTRACC has been one of obstructive and, frankly, less than honourable conduct by the Department of Health and, not to put too fine a point on it, mean and shabby behaviour by Ministers. Having followed the saga for the best part of eight years, I will take some persuading that what we see being rolled out in this order represents best value for money for the taxpayer or a well thought through means of achieving the Government&#146;s policy objectives.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000155"></a>The amounts of money collected by the CRU have consistently fallen short of predictions&#151;well short. When the CRU began to implement its responsibilities under 1999 Act, the operation was little short of chaotic. To be sure, it is more efficient now, but I am not sure how much more. In 1999, there was a huge backlog of cases to be followed up. All indications that I have&#151;and I would welcome confirmation or correction&#151;suggest that the bulk of those cases were never pursued. The financial loss to the NHS by reason of that failure by the CRU would have been significant. The scale of the workload entailed by the order will be considerable. The CRU estimated that in 2004-05, more than 77,000 claims were made against employers and that there were nearly 87,000 public liability claims. Doubtless, not all of them involved hospital treatment, but a great many will have done. If the CRU is now to undertake the collection of fees from personal injury cases, I hope that a very close watch will be kept on its efficiency and effectiveness, including cost effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000073"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to furnish me with some satisfactory replies on all these matters, if not today, then in writing. I am, of course, very willing to talk to her further.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000074"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0004.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="06120584000196"></a>Baroness Neuberger:</b> I am very grateful to the Minister for introducing the regulations. I am afraid that I had not heard the story of NARTRACC that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has just raised. I add my concern to his. If the story is as he has described it, and I imagine that it is, we need some kind of public explanation of why that should have been the case and why someone who, if you like, helped the Government to sort out how the compensation scheme should work should not have either been thanked or compensated.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000075"></a>I will now go back to what I was originally going to say. In principle, the regulations are good. The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee commented on the fact that two government departments have worked side by side and hand in hand and the silo mentality, unusually, seems to have been in abeyance. We would all celebrate that, and I am delighted by it. It is relatively unusual, and it is great. That is the first thing. There are some issues that need to be addressed. Before that, I seek one clarification. In the report by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, there is the conclusion that it would lead to roughly a 2 per cent all round premium increase for insurance. The Government&#146;s Explanatory Notes, assuming we are going for option 3 rather thanoption 2, state that the increase will be 1.5 per cent. It would be helpful, given that there is an issue about the cost, to know whether the increase in insurance claims is 1.5 per cent or 2 per cent. I would be very glad to hear that straightforward clarification.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000076"></a>I have two areas of concern, one of which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has already raised. The concern is whether the employers&#146; liability compulsory insurance market can cope. Given the number of delays in the introduction of this because of the doubt as to whether that market could cope, what is the evidence that suggests that it can cope now? Why is it okay now, when there was a deliberately delay of a year because clearly there were worries about it? It would be good to see what the evidence might be and to hear from the Minister on that.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000077"></a>In addition, there is the question of whether the CRU itself&#151;irrespective of whether it should have been put out to tender&#151;can cope with what is clearly going to be vastly increased amounts of business. Given the considerable delays in it at the moment, will it be able to tackle what seems to be a vastly increased role? If it will be dealing with all personal injury claims, which is what the regulations seem to suggest, there is a specific question in relation to cases where individuals who are not insured become liable and the extent to which the CRU is genuinely going to pursue them for these payments for the National Health Service. Or should those costs be borne by the public purse? There is a public policy question in relation to cases where the costs will not be picked up by insurers.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000078"></a>My second issue of concern is rather different, and I want some kind of explanation. We are told that there will be indicative tariffs instead of compensation reflecting the actual cost of treatment. Those tariffs look reasonable and a new one is being introduced for ambulance costs of &#163;159 per journey. I have done only a little private research on this, but it looks to me as if that figure is on the low side. How did the department reach that indicative cost? I am not entirely sure that I am convinced by indicative costs. Perhaps we should still look at compensation for the actual cost of the journey to the hospital. I imagine that the explanation is that it is simpler to do it by a tariff scheme, but I would still like to hear how the calculation was done, how the averages were arrived at and whether there will be a differential between different areas of the country. We know that the costs are very different;  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>London and the south-east is considerably more expensive than the north-east and the north-west. This tariff scheme bears close examination.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000079"></a>However, apart from those concerns and the serious concern raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I am delighted by the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000080"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0005.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06120584000197"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for their comments and general support, if not enthusiasm.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000081"></a>In relation to the comments from the Merits Committee, I, too, very much welcome (a), the fact that the silo mentality seems to have disappeared and (b), that the Merits Committee noted that. Both noble Lords understandably raised the issue of the employers&#146; liability compulsory insurance market. The Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions have been liaising closely on the introduction of the injury costs recovery scheme and the ELCI market. The Government, as the noble Earl pointed out, agreed to delay the introduction of the scheme until a study had been carried out. The final report was published in December 2003 and recommended that the implementation of the scheme be delayed for a further year.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000082"></a>A further consultation at the end of 2004 raised further concerns about the planned timing for introducing the ICR scheme, as the ELCI market was still considered to be fragile. However, after further discussions with the Department for Work and Pensions, which was developing a programme of work to implement the recommendations of the earlier study, Ministers agreed to a further postponement of the scheme&#146;s implementation until October of this year, to enable the programme of work to bed in. That has now happened and information from the Association of British Insurers is that increases in premiums in 2004 are, on average, between 15 per cent and 20 per cent, compared with between 30 per cent and 50 per cent in 2003. We estimate that the impact of the introduction of the scheme will be to increase premiums by 1.5 per cent, rather than the2 per cent mentioned by the noble Baroness, and that estimate has been confirmed by the Association of British Insurers. To recap, we have been working closely with ELCI, and it is confident that the scheme will not be an undue burden and can be implemented.</p>
<h5><a name="06120584000176"></a>6 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120584000095"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, implied that this is a stealth tax. It is not a stealth tax; rather it removes from the general taxpayer the burden of meeting some of the costs of treatment of the victims of other people&#146;s negligence and places the burden on the wrongdoer. Why should the man or woman in the street have to pay for the medical treatment of someone injured at work because their employer failed to take adequate steps to protect them?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000096"></a>The Department of Health currently pays the compensation recovery unit &#163;2.2 million for administering the road traffic scheme. Under the expanded scheme, it is estimated that the CRU will be handling significantly more claims. Running costs, including staff costs,are expected to be only slightly higher&#151;around&#163;2.4 million&#151;than for the road traffic recovery scheme.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000097"></a>I noted the concern expressed about the Compensation Recovery Unit, and I assure noble Lords that the implementation of the income contingent repayment scheme will be carefully monitored from the outset. Its success in terms of achieving policy objectives will be reviewed by the Department of Health not less than two years after implementation. It is likely to be at least that long, possibly longer, before the scheme is fully embedded so that its success can reasonably be assessed.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000098"></a>We believe that the CRU offers the best value for money in recovering central government moneys from compensators. It has a proven track record, electronic communications with all NHS trusts and, increasingly, with compensators. As part of central government, it has tight financial and information security requirements. There are no plans to put that work out for tender. I should add that the CRU&#146;s IT system is very good. Quite astonishingly for a government department, it recently received a prize for its technological output and the service it gives to those using it.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000099"></a>I note the deep concern expressed by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness about NARTRACC. I do not have any details that I can give the noble Earl today, but shall write to him at the earliest opportunity and will copy the letter to the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000100"></a>A question was asked about how we calculatethe charges. We have used a simple tariff based onthe average costs of people needing treatment for traumatic injuries, as with the existing scheme. The flat-rate charge for treatment without admission will include an amount towards the cost of any repeat attendances. A single one-off payment where hospital treatment is provided without admission will be &#163;505. The daily rate for treatment with admission also includes an element towards follow-up appointments. Ambulance costs will be levied on a one-off payment per journey basis. I note the comments of the noble Baroness about the &#163;159, but that is an average cost for traumatic injuries, not for all ambulance injuries. We are using a tariff rather than calculating each treatment, because it makes the scheme simpler and more economical to run.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000101"></a>Will householders have to pay if someone is injured on their premises? Any person who pays compensation to an individual, including private citizens, will become liable for repaying any associated NHS hospital and ambulance costs. However, if the person does not or cannot pay compensation, the NHS costs cannot be recovered. Many householders may find that they have some public liability insurance cover as it is often included in home buildings and contents insurance polices.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000102"></a>I think I have dealt with most of the questions raised, apart from that on NARTRACC, which I will write to the noble Earl about. If I have missed anything, or there is anything further noble Lords would like, I shall try to respond. If not, I will respond in writing.</p>

The Minister said that it was the belief of her department that the CRU offered best value for money in delivering the services that it does, but it did not seem from what she said that that belief was based on any hard evidence, because her department simply had not tested any alternatives. She said that there were no plans to put the work out to tender, but if the rules which were published in 1997 by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster still apply, I am not quite sure why that decision was taken. I would be grateful if the Minister came back to me and the noble Baroness on that issue.</p>

<h5><a name="06120584000177"></a>6.07 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120584000107"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0005.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06120584000203"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2006. <I>First Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000108"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank the Committee for agreeing to take together these two orders being made under Scotland Act powers. This is well-established practice and continues to make the best use of parliamentary time.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000109"></a>The two orders are made under different sections of the Scotland Act. The order concerning animal health is made under Section 104, which allows for necessary or expedient changes in consequence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000110"></a>The order relating to the transfer of functions&#151;in this instance, functions concerning the Healthy Start scheme and recent climate change legislation&#151;is made using the powers in Section 63 of the Scotland Act. The power is commonly referred to as an executive devolution order and allows for the transfer to Scottish Ministers of functions that they can then exercise in or as regards Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000111"></a>I hope that it will be helpful to Committee members to give a brief explanation of both orders. The Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2006 is made in consequence of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, which received Royal Assent on  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>11 July and is an Act of the Scottish Parliament. The 2006 Act introduces in Scotland a duty of care for all those who are responsible for animals to ensure that their welfare needs are met.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000112"></a>The power of courts to disqualify a person who has been convicted of an animal welfare offence from certain activities such as owning or keeping animals, which was previously contained in the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1954, is retained and strengthened in the 2006 Act. By &#147;strengthened&#148;, I mean that the 1954 legislation contained powers that could be used to disqualify people &#147;for having custody of&#148; any animal. The 2006 Act widens the scope of disqualification to catch owning, keeping, arranging to keep, dealing in or controlling animals, whether directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000113"></a>The specific purpose of the order is to maintain reciprocal arrangements on the enforcement of disqualification orders made by the Scottish courts in England and Wales. As was the case with disqualification orders made under the 1954 Act, the order also ensures that a person subject to a Scottish disqualification order made under the 2006 Act is unable to obtain a licence in England and Wales to keep an animal boarding, riding or dog-breeding establishment. That is consistent with the Animal Welfare Act, which was also given Royal Assent this year. It contains provisions&#151;agreed to by the Scottish Parliament in December 2005&#151;allowing recognition in Scotland of disqualification orders made by a court in England or Wales; effectively the mirror image of the order we are discussing today.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000114"></a>The Government and Scottish Executive believe that there should be co-operation to ensure that there is no scope for the exploitation of gaps between the animal welfare regimes north and south of the border. Both Administrations support the maintenance of the established principle of reciprocal recognition of court orders. This ensures that those convicted of serious cruelty to animals, and consequently disqualified from keeping animals in one jurisdiction, cannot escape the effect of that disqualification simply by crossing the border into another jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000115"></a>The second order before us is the ScotlandAct 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) (No.3) Order 2006. It allows for the transfer to Scottish Ministers of functions in two distinct policy areas. First, the Healthy Start scheme is the replacement for the current Welfare Food Scheme, introduced in Britain to combat food shortages during the Second World War. Latterly, the scheme offered milk and infant formula to low income families. Following a Department of Health review of that scheme, Section 13 of the Social Security Act 1988 was substituted by the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, among other things to enable the Welfare Food Scheme to be replaced by Healthy Start.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000116"></a>The new scheme offers vouchers that can be exchanged for milk, fresh fruit and vegetables, and infant formula to pregnant women and children under the age of four in certain low income families. The vouchers can be used in a wide range of participating shops and pharmacies. Under the Welfare Food Scheme, tokens  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could only be exchanged for milk and infant formula, but the new scheme offers much more flexibility and choice.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000117"></a>Although, like the Welfare Food Scheme, Healthy Start is primarily based upon social security benefits, and is therefore reserved, the range of foods and matters relevant to the NHS link closely to devolved health policy. The draft order therefore transfers to Scottish Ministers the functions of prescribing the description of foods to be made available under Healthy Start in Scotland in the future and issuing directions to the health boards that will be administering parts of the scheme in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000118"></a>The Scottish Ministers will deal directly with reimbursement in relation to Healthy Start vitamins. As with the Welfare Food Scheme, the intention is that contractors for the Department of Health will carry out day-to-day reimbursement functions for Healthy Start food. When dealing with reimbursement of suppliers and beneficiaries in Scotland, the Department of Health will be acting as an agent of the Scottish Ministers. This arrangement will enable the Scottish Ministers to take advantage of economies of scale and will be made possible by a further order under Section 93 of the Scotland Act. It will be made at the same time as this order. It will be subject to the negative resolution procedure and will go before the UK and Scottish Parliaments.</p>
<h5><a name="06120584000178"></a>6.15 pm</h5>
<p><a name="06120584000119"></a>The draft order before us today also provides for the transfer to Scottish Ministers of payment and reimbursement functions in relation to Healthy Start food vouchers and Healthy Start vitamins provided to beneficiaries in Scotland. These functions are similar to those currently carried out by Scottish Ministers in terms of Welfare Food scheme reimbursement.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000120"></a>The second order transfers to Scottish Ministers functions in Sections 32, 32A and 32B of the Electricity Act 1989 as amended by Sections 23 and 24 of the Climate Change and Sustainable EnergyAct 2006. The sections of the 1989 Act were previously executively devolved to Scottish Ministers and relate to functions allowing for the delivery of renewables obligations (Scotland), or ROS. The ROS is a key driver in increasing renewable generating capacity in Scotland. It works by imposing an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers in Scotland to provide an increasing proportion of the electricity that they supply from qualifying renewable sources, essentially sources of energy other than nuclear or fossil fuels, such as wind, wave power, solar and biomass.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000121"></a>As I mentioned, Sections 32, 32A and 32B of the 1989 Act have been amended by the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. These amendments make it easier for small/micro renewable generators to benefit from the support available under the ROS and its UK counterparts. The order therefore transfersthe relevant amended functions to Scottish Ministers. It also transfers functions that will enable such generators to appoint agents to act on their behalf, greatly reducing the administrative burden that some small generators may experience.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000122"></a>Finally, the order transfers functions that will enable generators who generate and consume their own electricity to qualify for renewable obligation certificates without having first to sell their electricity to and then purchase it back from an electricity supplier. I hope that noble Lords will agree that both orders are a sensible use of the powers in the Scotland Act and that their very practical impact is something to be welcomed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000123"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2006. <I>First Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="06120584000124"></a><b><a name="06120584000204"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I thank the Minister for having laid out these matters so extensively. We have not always agreed to take all the Scottish orders at the same time, because we generally get quite a pot-pourri of issues and sometimes one can couple them together and sometimes that seems a little more difficult. I declare an interest as I rear livestock in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000125"></a>Having sat through some of the discussion of statutes this afternoon and having noted the trials that have beset Defra in trying to transpose legislation from one printed source to another, we must congratulate the officials this time around. They have managed to pick up parts of the Animal Welfare Acts from Scotland and England, include them in this order and change all the numbers and, as far as I can see, they have done so in a perfect and accurate manner. I sometime wonder whether someone would like to run a competition between the departments on legislative drafting to see which can make the most perfect legislation. In this case, the Scotland Office is coming out ahead.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000126"></a>We are pleased at any moves to clarify or strengthen the powers that are needed to deal with an outbreak of infectious animal diseases. It is in everyone&#146;s interest that someone who is proven guilty of the deliberate infection of animals, which is mentioned in the Explanatory Notes, should be subject to a disqualification. As the Minister mentioned, the duty of care towards animals in the Act in Scotland is parallel to that which was envisaged by the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The main question that still arises, and which must be of concern to the Government and the rest of us, is whether to ban in Scotland the docking of certified working puppies&#146; tails. The proposal has been withdrawn in Scotland and is now out for consultation. One can envisage that being an issue. Would the owner of a dog which has been certified and docked in England, who takes up residence with his dog in Scotland, which had a ban, be subject to a disqualification order? If this were so, would the order be upheld if the owner then returned to England? There are great possibilities for a new economic trade in what we might term &#147;docking tourism&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000127"></a>Clause 44 of the 2006 Act contained powers to subject those disqualified in England and Wales to the same sanctions if they removed themselves to Scotland. As the Minister pointed out, this measure provides for an equivalent power to operate in the other direction.  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Perhaps the Minister might be able to clear up an anomaly. If one breaches the disqualification order in England, one is liable to imprisonment for 52 weeks or a fine not exceeding level 5. If one then goes to Scotland and commits a breach there, one will be liable to only 26 weeks&#146; imprisonment and a level 5 fine. However, if one is disqualified in Scotland and commits a breach in England, one is liable under Article 3(3) of this order to only 13 weeks&#146; imprisonment or a level 5 fine. It cannot be that the Scots are always more ready to pay the fine, but there must be some reason behind it.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000128"></a>I express my interest in the transfer of functions order as someone who hopes to gain some benefit from renewable energy generation. The Healthy Start scheme seems to be entirely to be recommended. The rest of the order follows on from a great deal of legislation which gives Scotland greater autonomy over renewable electricity generation, be it on shore, off shore, on the hills, under the ground and other possible variations, and in which most Members of the Committee have been involved.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000129"></a>The Explanatory Note states that the three previous SIs in relation to the Electricity Act 1989, which amend Sections 32, 32A and 32B, have now been amended by the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. Could not these changes have been allowed to read across into the Scottish legislation, without us having to pass a separate instrument? Better still, could not this instrument have been drafted in such a way as to do away with earlier instruments and consolidate their powers into one, thereby simplifying the legislation? Will the Minister also explain whether the second statutory instrument which is mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum&#151;that is, SI 2000/3252&#151;is that which is being modified in Article 3(3) of the order and described in note (f) as SI 2000/3253?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000130"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0005.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06120584000205"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for his explanation of the legislation. On the animal welfare order, we as Liberal Democrats are keen to make sure that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament are able fully to use the powers that they should have in devolved areas.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000131"></a>It clearly makes sense to be able to ensure&#151;this is the core of the proposal&#151;that those who are disqualified in one part of the United Kingdom are disqualified also from farming or other trades involving animals. We greatly welcome that. I also understand that herds or animals which have been moved can still be seized and put into care by order of a court. Again, that seems reasonable. The alternative would seem bizarre, with extradition orders for animals or even using a European arrest warrant to bring animals back and ensure that they are cared for. Clearly, the order makes sense.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000132"></a>It is now some two months since the Scottish Act came into force on 6 October. Have there been any cases where people with disqualified orders have moved across borders and not been prosecuted? On the other order, I am sure my noble friend Lord Steel will have more to say.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06120584000133"></a>To come back to power generation, it clearly makes sense for the greater authority in Scotland to move forward here as well. This seems to have happened through the passing of our own legislation, the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, which seems to have stopped what should be happening from happening. Can we have assurances that the Climate Change Bill, which will be introduced to Parliament in this Session, will not reverse what the Government are trying to with this order?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000134"></a>On the welfare food regulations, we entirely welcome the fact that the Scottish Executive have greater powers. In England and Wales, primary care trusts will ensure that children covered by the scheme are receiving nutrient benefits under it. Do the Executive have the power to give health boards similar responsibilities? It was clear when the Government introduced its Healthy Start scheme that the foods it covered would be under constant review. If a review takes place in England and Wales, will the Government expect the Executive to apply the findings to Scotland? Will they be shared, or will this be a completely autonomous matter for the Scottish Executive?</p>

<p><a name="06120584000135"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0005.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06120584000206"></a>Lord Steel of Aikwood:</b> I shall make a few remarks about the second of these orders, the transfer of functions to Scottish Ministers. I assume that the answer to my noble friend&#146;s question is that, yes, food matters would be devolved to the Scottish Ministers. That is the whole point of the order.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000136"></a>I want to say a few words because those with long memories will recall that, during the passage of the Scotland Act through both Houses, it was said many times by Donald Dewar, myself and others that devolution was not an event, it was a process. These orders, particularly the second, are proof of that: this is a furtherance of the whole process of bringing government as near to the people as is sensible.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000137"></a>At the time, we were promised that, after 10 years or so, there would be a review of the workings of the Scotland Act. That means that the review will take place during the next Scottish Parliament, the election of which is due in April&#151;not far away. That election being due is causing a flurry of opinion polls and speculation as to what the composition of the next Parliament will be. I would appeal for a moment of calm because I recall&#151;the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, will also recall, no doubt&#151;that in 1998 we had similar opinion polls predicting that there would be a great surge for the Scottish National Party. I remember the SNP campaigning in 1993 under the slogan &#147;Free by &#145;93&#148;. Doubtless, it will have a new one saying, &#147;In heaven by 2007&#148;. But there is no need for an absurd reaction to these things.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000138"></a>Recently, the Home Secretary, for whom I have a high regard, seemed to have taken leave of his senses in arguing that separation would make life easier for al-Qaeda in Scotland. This is an absurdity. There are far better arguments to combat separatism, one of which centres on the social security system to which this order relates. I recently chaired a commission to  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>look at possible ways in which we might transfer taxation powers to the Scottish Parliament. On one thing we were certain: the complexity of the social security system is such that it makes sense to retain it as a United Kingdom function and that to try to dismantle or separate it would be extremely expensive and complex. This order is a practical measure devolving to Scottish Ministers those parts of the social security system which can sensibly be devolved, particularly the Healthy Start scheme, which is a hybrid. It is a health matter as well as a social security matter and its operation is sensibly left north of the Border to Scottish Ministers. I welcome this order as a demonstration of devolution, of the Scotland Act working effectively and I thank the Minister for introducing it.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000139"></a><b><a name="61205-gc0006.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06120584000207"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Steel, for supporting these orders. As he said, devolution is a process and not an event. Orders were always anticipated as part of the sensible management of Scotland&#146;s devolution settlement and the provisions in the Scotland Act recognised this. I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his support and interesting comments. I hope to answer all the questions that I have been asked. If I miss any, I will write.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000140"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, for the care and attention that he has obviously given to the order. He asked about the banning of docking tails of puppies and whether an owner moving from England to Scotland would be banned. At the moment, I believe that the answer is &#147;no&#148;, but I understand that the Scottish Executive are considering this. I will provide clarity in writing once the consideration has finished, if it would be helpful, as I am sure that it would. The noble Duke asked about the climate change elements of the Section 63  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order. This will do away with and will replace the previous executive devolution order. He also asked why the penalties are lower for Scotland than for England. The Scotland Act requires them to belower. The power to make orders under Section 104 of the Scotland Act only allows imprisonment of up to three months on summary conviction or a fine not exceeding level 5.</p>

<p><a name="06120584000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked whether there have been any cases of people with disqualification orders moving to England between the passing of the Scotland Act and this order. The Scottish Executive have advised that no one with this problem has moved from Scotland to England. The noble Lord also asked: if a review takes place of foods covered, will a review also take place in Scotland? The power to specify the foods covered will be a matter for Scottish Ministers, but we would expect co-operation between the UK Government and the Scottish Ministers.

<h3 align="center"><a name="06120580000002"></a>Criminal Justice: Sentencing</h3>

<p><a name="06120580000009"></a><b><a name="61205-wms0001.htm_spnew131"></a><a name="06120580000054"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> The Minister of State for Northern Ireland (David Hanson) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000010"></a>Protection of the public is the first duty of the criminal justice system. That is one of the key reasons why, last year, the Northern Ireland Office undertook a comprehensive public consultation on proposals for reviewing the sentencing framework for Northern Ireland. As part of that process, I asked for views about how the criminal justice system can best tackle the threat which offenders, particularly violent and sexual offenders, pose to our society. It is the role of the Government to ensure that the widest possible range of sentencing options are available to the courts, to ensure that our responsibilities in terms of public protection, deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation can be fully realised.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000011"></a>Today I am able to announce that I intend to bring forward legislative proposals to introduce robust new indeterminate and extended public protection sentences that would, in future, put an end to automatic 50 per cent remission for dangerous violent and sexual offenders. These sentences would mean that those committing the most serious offences could, if necessary, be detained indefinitely, while those committing other specified offences could be detained to the end of their prison sentence.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000012"></a>Release, when it is deemed appropriate, would be decided by a new independent professional body, akin to the Parole Board in England and Wales, which would have to be satisfied that these offenders no longer pose a risk of serious harm to the public. Those released would remain subject to supervision for an extended period and would be required to comply with specific licence conditions, which would target, where appropriate, the factors which contributed to their offending in the first place. Offenders&#146; compliance with their licence conditions would be stringently monitored throughout the licence period, and breaches could result in their immediate recall to custody.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000013"></a>When implemented, the revised framework would see the end of automatic 50 per cent remission and the introduction of supervised licence periods for all prisoners. For this purpose, I intend to build on the successful foundations of existing statutory provisions to create a new sentence providing for compulsory post-release supervision. This would provide that the court would set a clearly defined custodial part of the sentence, which the offender must serve in full before being released on licence to serve the remainder of their sentence under supervision in the community. Offenders who breach their licence conditions can be subject to recall to custody to complete their sentence.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000014"></a>In support of these stringent supervision arrangements, I also intend to take powers to

The ability to tag prisoners would enable us more effectively to monitor their compliance with any curfew-based licence conditions while serving or completing their sentences under supervision in the community. I will additionally be making provision for electronic monitoring to be available as a condition of bail where the court feels this would be warranted.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000015"></a>As part of the overall approach to modernising the sentencing framework, I have also been examining measures which might provide a viable alternative to custody for low-risk offenders who do not constitute a danger to the public and for whom imprisonment many not necessarily be the most appropriate disposal. I intend to introduce a range of measures to support the collection of fines and provide that offenders defaulting on payment of fines may be subject to non-custodial sentences, requiring them to undertake unpaid work in the community rather than being imprisoned for very short periods, which, for some, have little deterrent or rehabilitative effect.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000016"></a>I also intend, subject to resources, to implement existing statutory provisions for drug testing and treatment orders. These orders would provide that individuals who do not pose a risk to the public and whose offending is triggered by dependency problems could, instead of being given a custodial sentence, be subject to these robust community sentences requiring them to undertake a treatment and rehabilitation programme. Their progress would be subject to review by the courts.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000017"></a>I propose to consult on a set of draft legislative proposals and will welcome further views on the detail of what is proposed at that time. Subject to those views and the availability of parliamentary time, the provisions should be passed into law during 2007. The fact that significant resources will be needed to give effect to these measures means that the pace of implementation will be dependent on the spending review settlement, to be agreed next summer.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000018"></a>I firmly believe that the package of measures which I have outlined will significantly enhance Northern Ireland's sentencing framework. It will provide courts with the range of sentencing options necessary to enable the sentence to reflect to the full the seriousness of the offence. It will provide increased supervision of offenders and a focus for rehabilitative efforts both in custody and in the community. And, most importantly, it will provide the community with enhanced public protection from the most dangerous people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000021"></a><b><a name="06120580000056"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Geoff Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000022"></a>According to the conclusions of the June 2006 European Council, the German presidency will present a report at the June 2007 European Council based on extensive consultations with member states about the future of Europe. The purpose of this Statement is to inform the House about the principles that will underpin the Government's approach to these discussions.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000023"></a>Europeans need to be equipped to maximise the opportunities, and minimise the risks, that globalisation presents. By retaining our focus on the delivery of practical benefits to citizens, the EU can demonstrate the tangible contribution it makes to enhancing prosperity and security in a global age. Enlargement has delivered an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity within the EU&#146;s borders. The prospect of EU membership is extending these benefits to our neighbours. In the forthcoming discussions, the Government's overall aim will be to maintain the EU&#146;s focus on the delivery of policy and, in discussion on the future of Europe, they will be guided by the following principles.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000024"></a>Pursuing British interests: our starting point is that we must safeguard our prosperity and security. Britain is a strong, confident and influential European power that can help to lead reform and modernisation, shape debates, build alliances and win the arguments. By engaging with our European partners and friends, we get the right results for Britain and for Europe as a whole. The EU's focus on delivery of policy is an example of where we have helped to steer the EU towards a path that provides practical benefits for all Europe's citizens.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000025"></a>Modernisation and effectiveness: the EU is crucial for delivering what we want in a whole range of areas, such as climate and energy security, promotion of trade liberalisation, and migration. We recognise that the EU must continue to adapt and modernise if it is to implement effectively the policies that we want and support. We will therefore favour proposals that modernise the workings of the EU so that it is better equipped to meet both today&#146;s and future challenges.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000026"></a>Consensus: the European Union is now a much broader organisation and there is a wide range of views to be taken into account. Fifteen member states have substantially completed their domestic ratification procedures. Ten member states have not ratified, of which two, France and the Netherlands, have held referenda which resulted in &#147;no votes&#148;. Decisions on next steps will have to be agreed by all the member states and take account of all relevant interests.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000027"></a>Subsidiarity (working at the right level): we will continue to ensure that action is taken at the right level. In areas where the EU can add value, it should do so. But where there are issues that can most effectively be tackled at the national level, the onus  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS120"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column WS120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remains on member states to take action. We continue to be in favour of measures which enhance subsidiarity and the role of national parliaments.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000028"></a>Use of existing treaties: as agreed at the June 2006 European Council, we need to make best use of the possibilities offered by the existing treaties, in order to deliver practical results that citizens expect. For example, the European arrest warrant, which was agreed on the basis of the current treaties, allows us to speed up and simplify arrangements for cross-border investigations and prosecutions, thereby making a significant contribution to the fight against cross-border crime.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000029"></a>Openness: the EU must keep pace with global change. We want an EU which is outward-looking and open to new developments, trade and investment and developing partnerships with third countries.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="06120580000005"></a>Legal Services Board</h3>

<p><a name="06120580000030"></a><b><a name="06120580000057"></a>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton):</b> On 23 November, the Government introduced the Legal Services Bill. Two of the key elements of the Bill are proposals for the establishment of a Legal Services Board (LSB) and the establishment of an Office for Legal Complaints (OLC). The LSB will be an overarching regulator and the OLC will deal with all complaints about regulated legal-service providers.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000031"></a>In June 2006, the Government announced that their preferred location for the OLC was the West Midlands. This announcement was based on a strong business case. Since that announcement, we have been looking at potential locations for the LSB.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000032"></a>Following a thorough analysis of a range of options, there is not an obvious candidate for a preferred location for the LSB; therefore, the Government have decided to leave the decision to the LSB, once appointed. In the absence of a strong business case to support a preferred location, a decision at this stage would be premature.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="06120580000006"></a>Planning</h3>

<p><a name="06120580000033"></a><b><a name="06120580000058"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000034"></a>The Government are today announcing provisional allocations of the first tranche of &#163;28.8 million out of a total of &#163;120 million of planning delivery grant (PDG) for 2007-08. We are also announcing additional support to local planning authorities in preparing local development frameworks.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000035"></a><I>Planning Delivery Grant Allocations</I></p>

<p><a name="06120580000036"></a>Planning delivery grant is paid to local authorities and other bodies to support improvement in the delivery of planning services. Over the period 2003-08 the Government will have made available a total of &#163;605 million through PDG. Kate Barker&#146;s review, published today, and our own independent impact  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS121"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column WS121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>monitoring acknowledge the benefits which the grant has had in raising the profile of planning, providing additional resources for both development management and plan-making, and incentivising improvement in performance against the background of a rapidly expanding volume of applications.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000037"></a>The announcement today includes the first tranche of awards for performance in improving the speed of handling planning applications in the year ending June 2006. These awards amount to &#163;14.5 million, with a further allocation of &#163;500,000 in respect of mineral and waste applications.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000038"></a>As last year, grant allocations for development control performance have been reduced for those authorities whose performance in defending appeals is significantly below the national average. Authorities that are at least 40 per cent worse than the national average of 33.26 per cent have their development control allocation abated by 10 per cent, and for those whose performance is at least 50 per cent worse, the abatement increases to 20 per cent. This is to ensure that the grant is not rewarding poor-quality decisions.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000039"></a>Authorities participating in a housing market renewal pathfinder have been allocated &#163;100,000 each from a total of &#163;2.5 million to pump-prime planning efforts to tackle low demand. In addition, authorities identified by the Chancellor as having enterprise areas within their boundaries are provisionally allocated a share of &#163;2.2 million to recognise challenges of high deprivation; it is intended to work alongside existing forms of government assistance, such as exemption from stamp duty, and neighbourhood renewal projects.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000040"></a>Regional planning bodies (RPBs) receive provisional allocations totalling &#163;3 million to support their work preparing regional spatial strategies and in recognition of the additional work which the strengthened regional planning function involves. RPB performance against business plans has been satisfactory, and there are no proposals to abate these awards. The Greater London Authority (GLA) receives &#163;50,000 for its contribution to improving planning in London.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000041"></a>The remaining &#163;6 million of the grant will be used to support a number of national initiatives and is broken down as follows: the Planning Advisory Service and the Advisory Team for Large Applications will be allocated &#163;2 million each, for their work supporting local authority planning performance; &#163;1 million will be allocated to the Planning Inspectorate for its work on local development plan preparation; and, finally, there is &#163;1 million to fund postgraduate planning bursaries to increase capacity in local planning authorities and address difficulties caused by the shortage of qualified planners.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000042"></a>The provisional allocations will be finalised and a final determination made in April 2007. A further allocation for the remainder of PDG will be made in June 2007, which will include the second tranche of development control, progress on plan-making and sustainable development, e-planning and housing in high-demand areas. This represents a further &#163;91 million of planning delivery grant.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000043"></a>A table showing the provisional amounts payable is available in the Libraries of both Houses. This sets out the details of each recipient's provisional grant allocations for development control, enterprise areas and low housing demand together with abatements for poor appeals performance.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000044"></a><I>Local Development Frameworks</I></p>

<p><a name="06120580000045"></a>The new local development frameworks (LDFs) are bringing together community members, infrastructure providers and the development industry to draw up new plans for the provision of homes, jobs and community facilities. It is therefore vital that local authorities have the key documents up to date and in place as soon as possible. The production of local development frameworks is proceeding, with considerable work under way in local authorities across the country, some of which have given little attention to this side of their responsibilities in the past. The new system is very different from the old, and we are setting out additional support for LAs to complete this round of LDFs. The Government are also introducing immediate additional support to local planning authorities in this area.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000046"></a>First, we are preparing some illustrations of how different kinds of core strategies might look, to give further guidance to LPAs, and we will publish these before Christmas. A number of staff from the Planning Inspectorate will provide additional support and advice to local planning authorities through government offices. My department is today publishing some key reports from the Spatial Plans in Practice project which identify emerging good practice. The Planning Advisory Service continues to provide key support to local authorities on their LDF responsibilities through seminars and producing a diagnostic tool for assessing LPAs&#146; capabilities, which is being trialled in 22 authorities.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000047"></a>Following the submission of annual monitoring reports at the end of this year and any review of what documents may need to be prepared to support implementation of the new PPS3, we will be expecting LPAs to make final adjustments to their local development schemes. Thereafter, government offices will be treating them as the definitive programme management documents which will only be departed from in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000048"></a>We will be working with local planning authorities and the planning profession to see how the new system can be further streamlined for the next round of LDFs once core strategies are in place. Copies of all supporting documents are being placed in the House Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000050"></a>Kate Barker has today published the final report of her independent review of land-use planning. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000051"></a>Kate Barker was asked by the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister in December 2005 to conduct an independent review of the land-use planning system in England. The terms of reference were to consider how, building on recent reforms, the planning system could better deliver economic growth alongside other sustainable development goals. Her interim report was published in July 2006.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000052"></a>Kate Barker's final report makes clear that planning is a valued and necessary activity that can deliver positive outcomes, alongside important social and environmental objectives. She is clear that, in taking forward further reforms, the importance of consultation and democratic accountability must be respected. But, within this framework, she concludes that the context for the planning system is becoming ever more challenging and therefore recommends further wide-ranging reform, building on recent  


<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS124"></a><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column WS124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changes and the plan-led approach, to ensure that the planning system supports sustainable economic growth in a global economy. We have already introduced substantial reforms to the planning system to speed up the plan-making process and, most recently, to planning for housing as a result of Kate Barker's first report. We will also shortly publish a new draft Planning Policy Statement on climate change to help reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<p><a name="06120580000053"></a>The Government welcome Kate Barker's report, which we will take forward, and agree with her overall analysis. We will set out in a White Paper in spring 2007 our proposals in response to her recommendations for improving the speed, responsiveness and efficiency of land-use planning, and for taking forward Kate Barker's and Rod Eddington's proposals for reform of major infrastructure planning. In the mean time, the Government will be interested to hear responses to the report. Finally, I would like to put on record my thanks to Kate Barker and her team for their work on this review.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000110"></a><b><a name="06120575000992"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> Giving priority to siblings in school admissions can support families, especially those with young children, and this is acknowledged in paragraph 2.10 of the draft new school admissions code. The Education and Skills Select Committee, in its 2004 report on secondary school admissions, supported the use of this criterion but was concerned that giving priority to siblings could also substantially reduce the number of school places available for other families, including those with only one child or where the eldest child has yet to start school. This is exacerbated if schools do not take account of a family's change of address when applying the sibling criterion or by the use of other criteria, such as catchment areas that are some distance from the school.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000111"></a>Giving priority to siblings will reduce the number of places available to other families. At schools with a high proportion of selection by ability or aptitude there will be fewer non-selective places available for other families if siblings of those admitted by selection are given priority. Accordingly, paragraph 2.13 of the draft school admissions code states that priority for admission to schools that select more than 10 per cent of the intake by ability or aptitude should not be given to children on the basis that they have a sibling at the school. This is not an absolute prohibition; schools may continue to use the criterion but will need to justify doing so in the context of admission arrangements in their area if an objection is made to the schools adjudicator.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000112"></a>Parental support for schools is important, and the Government recognise this in the draft new school admissions code. The Government are also aware that some partially selective schools are concerned that they will not be able to encourage a family ethos if they do not give priority to siblings. The new code will

It is essential that we extend fair access and choice to all families, not just a few.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000113"></a>To date, more than 2800 representations have been received on this issue, primarily from parents who have children at partially selective schools and who may have expected their younger children also to be admitted. All the responses to the consultation will be taken into account in preparing the new school admissions code, for which we will seek the approval of Parliament early in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000115"></a><b><a name="06120575000994"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> We expect local authorities to take action to ensure that any school in an Ofsted category is improved and removed from that category as soon as possible. Each of these schools will have its own mix of issues that need to be addressed and resolved with urgency. The Education Act 2006 will ensure that local authorities act more swiftly and decisively to turn round a school in special measures. The Act strengthens authorities&#146; powers of intervention in such schools and, in order to protect the interests of children, provides for radical action such as closure to be taken where inadequate progress is being made after 12 months.</p>

Awards are made annually on the basis of investment in the governing bodies&#146; World Class Performance Pathway. The total level of financial support received includes programme funding direct to the NGB, a budget for athlete personal awards, usually paid directly to the athlete by UK Sport, plus an allocation from TASS funding and for EIS service provision. A quarter payment would usually be a quarter of that total annual award; however, the actual amount received is variable, as it is subject to each sport&#146;s agreed drawdown requirement based on cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000120"></a>For 15 of the Olympic summer sports receiving new or additional funding for London 2012, funding is also subject to their progress against a number of agreed performance and governance triggers. These triggers, in two distinct stages, were announced by UK Sport in April 2006 as a means to ensure that the governing bodies were &#147;fit for purpose&#148; in relation to their receiving public funds.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000121"></a>For Q3, the final quarter of 2006, each sport will have been assessed against the funding triggers and the funding received based on their being in one of the following four categories:</p>

<ul><a name="06120575000935"></a>What is the level of financial support budgeted to be sent to each of the 35 Olympic governing bodies to assist with their development and elite squad preparation during the last quarter of 2006. [HL304]</ul>
<p><a name="06120575000340"></a><b><a name="61205w0002.htm_spnew172"></a><a name="06120575001000"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> UK Sport, the Government&#146;s lead agency for elite sport, currently invests in 29 of the 35 Olympic governing bodies of sport. Awards are made annually on the basis of investment in the governing bodies&#146; World Class Performance Pathway. The total level of financial support budgeted includes programme funding direct to the NGB, a budget for athlete personal awards, usually paid direct to the athlete by UK Sport, plus an allocation from TASS funding and for EIS service provision. The budget is therefore a quarter of that total annual award.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000341"></a>A list of all UK Sport funded governing bodies, outlining the annual budgeted total pathway award and budgeted quarterly payment, follows.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000878"></a><I>Letter from Mrs Katharine Bryan to Lord Laird</I></p>

<p><a name="06120575000879"></a>You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about why recruitment advertisements were placed in the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I> on 17 November for the reorganised Water Service in Northern Ireland before the outcome of a current judicial review was known (HL206). As this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of the Water Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="06120575000880"></a>The outcome of the judicial review on the water reform legislation would have had no effect on the need for the posts advertised in the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I> on 17 November 2006. These posts are considered crucial to the delivery by the Water Service of the improved efficiency and cost reductions required under the water reform agenda. The successful applicants will assist the Water Service in providing a value-for-money service, which will ensure that charges to customers are kept to a minimum.</p>
