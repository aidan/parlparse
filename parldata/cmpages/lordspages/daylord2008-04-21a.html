<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0804215000020"></a>During the discussion on the Statement on Zimbabwe on 3 April, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0804215000293"></a>&#147;Unless the present head of the UNDP is withdrawn, there will not be very much confidence in the UN&#146;s role in the future of Zimbabwe. Two successive UNDP leaders have been far too close to Mugabe and indeed, in one case, have taken land from him&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/4/08; col. 1187.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000284"></a>I do not resile from my reservations about the UNDP&#146;s relations with the Government of Zimbabwe. However, I said in good faith and believing it to be fact that one of the two heads of the UNDP in Zimbabwe had accepted favours of, I thought, land. I now recognise that I was wrong in believing what I said to be a generally accepted fact. I have and had no evidence to support my statement. I therefore wish to apologise, first, to the House for making a statement that I should not have made and, secondly, to Mr Angelo and Mr Zacarias for the unfavourable imputations that I have made against their reputations.</p>

In recent months at European Councils, I have been face to face with German and French Ministers and have listened to them point to the changes that they want. The French take over the presidency next month. They have made it clear that their four themes are food security, balanced trade, rural cohesion and new environmental challenges.

Would the Government be prepared to give the House the benefit of some studies that they might make on the impact of the rise in food prices on all these issues, which would make subsidisation of agricultural products a much less attractive proposition than it was before?</p>

The Prime Minister has written to the Prime Minister of Japan as chair of the G8 to put this issue on the G8&#146;s agenda. There is no single answer on the rise in commodity prices, but two poor harvests and the drought in Australia have contributed enormously to the drop in total grain stocks around the world. On top of that, the demand for food in China and India has changed. As I said, these issues will be raised at the G8 at the request of the Prime Minister.</p>

The key to this is establishing the National Apprenticeship Service in 2009. Apprenticeship policy is a devolved matter and decisions on apprenticeship arrangements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are matters for the devolved Administrations.</p>

Does she agree that the National Apprenticeship Service faces a big challenge, in view of the fact that in the private sector in this country there is only a 10 per cent take-up of apprenticeships, out of 1.4 million VAT-registered businesses? In view of that, the scheme has to be robust. Will the Minister assure us that there will be members on the board who have experience in the workplace so that they are able to represent, in particular, small businesses? Moreover, will small businesses be given the financial and other help they need? If so, in what way?</p>

I have reason to be optimistic about this because the Government have seen the number of those successfully completing apprenticeships rise from 40,000 in 2001-02 to over 100,000 today. While we believe that there is reason to be optimistic, the noble Lord is right to say that this is a major challenge.</p>

The healthcare professional&#146;s role is to allow the individual to assess these risks and to make their own decisions about what to do; it is not to tell them who they should marry. As a result the Government have made a significant investment in this field, not only in the training of genetic counsellors but in changing the curriculum of primary care colleagues with the collaboration of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

In Leicester, the local genetics service worked with community groups to raise awareness of the possible risks and the availability of a local specialist genetic service to provide advice and information. Local health services in Bradford also have plans to develop community outreach work to raise awareness, particularly in communities at higher risk.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80421-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0804215000099"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 63 and 64. These amendments would simply leave out Clauses 21 to 23. My noble friend Lord Kingsland spoke to these briefly on one of the latter days in Committee back in February, at some relatively late time of night: I think that it was at 9.25, after dinner. He did not move them on that occasion, but he set out our case. The Minister assured the Committee at that time that the Government were, as he described it,</p>
<ul><a name="0804215000349"></a>&#147;on a roll at the moment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>26/2/08; col. 642.]</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000286"></a>I do not know whether they still are; they can tell us that later, but I can assure him that we will certainly want to divide on this in due course.</p>

<a name="80421-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0804215000100"></a>These clauses amend the 2003 Act to provide for creating a,</p>
<ul><a name="0804215000350"></a>&#147;period of remand on bail&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000287"></a>on an electronically monitored curfew, and to take that against a subsequent sentence. Put very simply, we believe that this is loopy, and I suspect that most of the population would agree that it is mad. The Government are saying, briefly, that while someone is at home on an electronic curfew&#151;as long as they are there for more than nine and a half hours, I think&#151;and sitting or lying in bed there, perhaps watching &#147;Match of the Day&#148;, or &#147;I&#146;m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!&#148;, or possibly even a party political broadcast from the party opposite, that time shall be taken into account in any subsequent custodial sentence. As I say, that is loopy and most people would think it mad. It is not the right way to go about it.</p>

<a name="80421-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0804215000101"></a>We know exactly why the Government are doing this; to reduce artificially the number of people in prison. That is a perfectly laudable ambition&#151;there is nothing wrong with the idea of trying to reduce that number&#151;but we do not happen to think this is the right way to go about it. When he responded to this matter back on 26 February, the Minister said that credit is not being given on the basis that defendants have been denied their liberty, but rather that they have complied with their bail condition while on curfew. Well, that is not how most of us see it. We

<a name="80421-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0804215000102"></a>Further, as my noble friend made quite clear, there is the possibility of perverse incentives, as in the position where defence solicitors could ask for a longer curfew period just to make sure that the custodial sentence was likely to be reduced because, as he put it, it covered more than the eight and a half hours, or whatever the limit was. We would have defence counsel arguing for a longer curfew period than he would otherwise think necessary purely to get time off for his client on a later occasion.</p>

<a name="80421-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0804215000103"></a>As I said the Minister thought that he and the Government were on a roll when they dealt with this issue last time. It might have been because we had just had one of those Divisions that sometimes happen late at night that the Government had managed to win. On this occasion, I will listen carefully to what the Government have to say but unless the Minister can come up with better answers than he did before I will be tempted to test the opinion of the House again. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0804215000104"></a><a name="80421-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80421-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0804215000719"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for allowing us to discuss this matter again. I shall not tempt fate by describing why I said we were on a roll when we debated it last time. The noble Lord is right that the measure comes as a result of the review of prisons by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and it is one of the steps that we would like to take to help manage demand for prison places. We have discussed prisons for some weeks now, and noble Lords will know of the challenge of the current demand for prison places. The Carter proposals are a mixture of an expansion of places over the next few years, together with what is described as demand management. Our proposal is one of those initiatives to reduce demand for prison places.</p>

<a name="80421-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0804215000105"></a>I confirm to the noble Lord that to qualify for the curfew credit, defendants must have been subject to an electronically monitored curfew for at least nine hours per day to reflect the position that being subject to a curfew does not equal a deprivation of liberty, whereas remand to custody clearly does. Each curfew day will provide potential credit against sentence of no more than half a day. The court will be required to take into account the defendant&#146;s compliance with the curfew when deciding the period to be credited. The credit will not be made on the basis that the defendants have been deprived of their liberty; they will be credited for the fact that they have complied with their bail conditions while having their liberty restricted on a preventive rather than punitive basis. The credit will be made on the basis that even though being under a curfew is less arduous than being remanded in custody, both are intended as a preventive measure designed to secure the judicial process rather than to punish the offender. The provisions will apply only to defendants bailed under the Bail Act, as amended by the Bill, who are subject to an electronically monitored curfew bail condition of at least nine hours per day.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0804215000106"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, feels that this is a reward to watch &#147;Match of the Day&#148;, but it is not. The curfew times and hours will be decided by the court, which will take into account the nature of the bail represented by the defendant. Of course, the curfew may be imposed for periods when the defendant is considered more likely to offend or to interfere with witnesses. Such periods might often be during the evening and into the early hours when defendants can get into trouble after a night out at the pub. That is why typical curfew hours tend to be overnight. The curfew can be tailored to cover other risks. For example, the court could curfew a football hooligan during match times or a shoplifter during peak shopping hours.</p>

<a name="80421-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0804215000107"></a>On the question of a perverse incentive, we believe that this is a sensible preventive measure that will provide an incentive to those remanded on bail who are subject to an electronically monitored curfew to comply with their conditions. Of course in relation to the perverse incentive that is where I would rely on the discretion of the sentencer to arrive at the right decision. Given all our debates on the question of the discretion of the judiciary, surely the noble Lord, Lord Henley, could rely on that.</p>

<p><a name="0804215000109"></a>be taken into account. Does that mean that the Minister has in mind that the judge might impose a longer sentence than otherwise to allow for a sufficient period in prison, in which case he would probably be breaching the sentencing rules?</p>

I thought the noble Lord, Lord Henley, was suggesting that, in certain circumstances, defence lawyers would request particular conditions because it would then lead to a certain time being taken off the defendant if subsequently convicted. I was answering that point.</p>

Everything that has so far been proposed by the Government to this end has been opposed by the Conservatives. It would be helpful if they could put something positive in its place. In the mean time, this seems to be moving in the right direction; therefore I oppose the amendment.</p>

I would paraphrase &#147;demand management&#148; as letting out early slightly more people than they should, which is a mistake, and

No doubt, if he is a football hooligan, he is still able to watch television.

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement about this morning&#146;s announcement by the Bank of England to improve conditions in the financial markets. The scheme has been developed following extensive discussions with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I also want to report on the recent G7 meeting in Washington on restoring financial stability to financial markets. I will also report on measures we are taking here at home to strengthen the stability of the banking system, as well as to help homeowners with their mortgages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Before I set out in further detail the Bank of England&#146;s special scheme, let me remind the House of the background against which it has been developed.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1268"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The financial markets throughout the world remain turbulent, following the problems that arose in the US housing market last year. Functioning financial markets rely on banks and building societies being able to raise finance from each other&#151;and from other investors&#151;including through securitisation markets and inter-bank lending markets. These funds can then be used to finance lending to businesses and consumers, including for the provision of mortgages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;But global financial markets are not currently functioning normally. Across the world there is a lack of confidence in credit markets&#151;most notably mortgage-backed securities. That lack of confidence was prompted by the downturn in the US housing market and in particular by the problems associated with sub-prime mortgages there. Banks are reluctant to lend to each other, and as a result lending to customers is more expensive and more restricted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Along with other central banks, the Bank of England has over the past few months made additional funding available to the markets through its regular market operations. The UK financial system remains fundamentally strong and the Bank of England&#146;s action has helped to take some of the pressure out of the system by giving the banks additional liquidity to continue their usual banking operations. Last week, it made a further &#163;15 billion available, over three months, as part of its open markets operations. And the governor has said that he is committed to providing the liquidity assistance that the system as a whole needs to function normally.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Here at home, the economy continues to grow. Last week&#146;s figures confirm that unemployment remains low and employment high. That and the recent interest rates cut will provide wider support for the housing market and the wider economy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As banks here and across the world disclose their losses and strengthen their financial positions, which will help to rebuild confidence, the Bank of England can now take action to ease conditions in the financial markets, particularly in relation to mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The special scheme announced by the Bank of England today is a further step towards tackling these problems, which have become more evident in recent weeks, with the increasing cost and decreasing availability of lending by banks and building societies.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Under the new scheme, for a six-month period, the banks and building societies and other institutions that are eligible for the Bank's standing facility will be able to enter into agreements with the Bank of England under which they exchange high-quality asset-backed securities for Treasury bills. They can then hold these bills or trade them in the markets. Each exchange agreement will be for a maximum of a year, but can be renewed at the Bank&#146;s discretion, so that the exchange could ultimately be for up to three years.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The arrangement is available only for assets existing at the end of December and does not  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1269"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apply to new lending since then. At the end of the scheme, the banks will return the Treasury bills to the Bank of England, and will receive back the securities which they had provided as collateral. This means that the banks will continue to hold the risk on the securities they provide, so it is them rather than the Bank of England that will be exposed to any fall in value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;At all times, the banks must provide as security to the Bank of England assets worth significantly more than the Treasury bills they receive in return. If the value of their assets falls, the banks must provide more assets to the Bank of England or return some of their Treasury bills. They will be charged a commercial rate, so there is no subsidy to the banking sector.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Bank of England expects the initial take-up to be &#163;50 billion. It will monitor the position daily, both to check new bids from the banks and to track the value of the assets exchanged as collateral. The</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Treasury is supporting the scheme announced by the Bank of England by lending to it&#151;at a commercial rate&#151;the Treasury bills that they will then exchange with the banks and building societies. As the House will know, the Government stand behind the Bank as its sole shareholder and we are making this clear by providing an indemnity. The Bank of England believes that these measures will support the banking sector during the present period of uncertainty and will help to restore the stability that the financial markets need, both now and in the longer term. This will help alleviate the problems that have seen banks reluctant to lend to each other, and in turn support the provision of new mortgage lending.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Maintaining economic and financial stability is the Government&#146;s key priority. In addition to the Bank of England&#146;s announcement, I confirm to the House that the Government will take further action, at home and internationally, to restore stability in financial markets. It is important that banks continue to make full disclosure of their exposure to losses and do so as soon as possible. That is why, at the G7 and IMF committee meetings in Washington, we agreed that banks should be as open as possible, as quickly as possible, in order to remove the continuing uncertainty as to their true positions. This process has started throughout the world, including here in Britain, with banks disclosing their losses and making proposals to rebuild their capital positions. Transparency is an essential part, along with other steps we are taking, of stabilising financial markets.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In Washington last week, the Financial Stability Forum agreed a range of actions, some to be implemented in the next three months, others in the longer term. We agreed to strengthened oversight of risk management, including capital and liquidity; clearer standards for valuation and transparency; and changes in the role and use of credit ratings. We will strengthen international co-operation, so that we are better able to prevent  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1270"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crises and deal with problems that occur. We are also working with the IMF to allow it to play a greater role in providing an early warning of threats to financial stability, so that the relevant authorities can take early action to prevent these actions in the future.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Here at home, we are about to finish consulting on the reforms to the banking system that I announced in January. These reforms will make it easier to intervene in the event that a bank gets into trouble, in order to protect depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system. Because it is important that we get this right, I will continue to hold further discussions with the industry on the detail of these proposals before bringing forward legislation. We will also make changes to the Bank of England to emphasis its role in maintaining financial stability. The responses we have received so far to the consultation have made it clear that, given the importance of these reforms, it is crucial that we have further discussion. Once that is completed, I can confirm that it remains our intention to introduce legislation this Session to strengthen financial stability and depositor protection. The legislation needs to be on the statute book early next year, when some provisions of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act are due to expire.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Finally, we are determined to do everything we can to help homeowners, so I am meeting the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the Finance and Leasing Association and major lenders tomorrow, along with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Housing Minister. Since 2004, mortgage lenders have been required by statute to treat their customers fairly, and at our meeting I will be discussing how banks and building societies can help people whose fixed rate mortgages are coming to an end, as well as helping people who may get into difficulties in repaying their mortgages. Banks and building societies have a duty to treat their customers fairly and, in the light of everything we are doing with them, I want to discuss with them how they can pass on the benefits of falling interest rates, as well as wider government support to mortgage holders. The Government will continue, along with the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, to do everything they can to maintain stability.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The announcement by the Bank of England this morning will help to resolve the problems in the wholesale financial markets, with their subsequent impact on the retail markets&#151;so helping business, individuals and, in particular, the mortgage market. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0804215000127"></a>It has taken the Government and the Bank a long time to get to this position. The US Federal Reserve Bank liberalised its collateral requirements over a month ago, and in the UK the various attempts to date to inject additional liquidity have achieved little, and LIBOR has remained stubbornly high even when the bank rate has been reduced.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0804215000128"></a>In general, the UK has been behind the pace in dealing with the credit crunch as it has unfolded. The Minister will need no reminding that the Government&#146;s dithering over Northern Rock was in large measure responsible for the end result; a nationalised bank with a &#163;100 billion balance sheet underwritten by the taxpayer. We have no timetable for the so-called temporary ownership to end that, so the taxpayer will be standing behind that balance sheet for some time to come.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0804215000129"></a>I mention Northern Rock to put today&#146;s announcement of a further &#163;50 billion in context. It looks rather modest. Furthermore, I understand that the total amount of bank and building society debt that needs to be refinanced this year could be as high as &#163;750 billion, so there has to be a serious question over whether today&#146;s move will be sufficient. The Statement implies that the &#163;50 billion facility may be increased. Under what circumstances will the Bank of England extend the facility beyond the first &#163;50 billion? What will trigger this? Will Parliament be informed?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0804215000130"></a>The Government&#146;s spin on today&#146;s news is that it will help those with mortgages. The Statement referred to tomorrow&#146;s meeting between the Chancellor and the Council of Mortgage Lenders as if that will solve some of the difficulties facing lenders and borrowers. The Chancellor needs to be aware that the Council of Mortgage Lenders&#146; response to the Bank&#146;s announcement this morning was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0804215000298"></a>&#147;The recent trend of mortgage products being removed and mortgage prices increasing for new customers will be affected more by how LIBOR responds to the announcement. The improved liquidity is unlikely to reverse the trend to higher mortgage costs we have seen in recent weeks&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000288"></a>No joy there, then. The <I>Financial Times</I> Alphaville site said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0804215000299"></a>&#147;The spin may be about the housing market. But this is really about the money markets&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000289"></a>The cost of the Special Liquidity Scheme is linked to LIBOR, but LIBOR is part of the problem of rising mortgage interest rates. Can the Minister explain how a LIBOR-related lending facility will help the mortgage market? There is no requirement for the banks to use the proceeds from this facility to reinvest in residential mortgages, so if the Government really have an objective of supporting the mortgage market, how will they ensure that they get value for money from taxpayers&#146; backing of this new facility?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0804215000131"></a>The &#147;haircuts&#148; that the Bank proposes to use are very large. In the extreme case, a fixed interest rate,  10 to 30-year own name covered bond for which no market price is observable, denominated in euros or dollars, could pick up a haircut of 35 percentage points. Haircuts are a way of expressing risk. Can the Minister explain how the Government and the Bank have arrived at their risk percentages? Does this  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1272"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>represent a view that the mortgage market in the UK and the rest of the EU is carrying risks of up to 35 per cent in loss of value?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0804215000132"></a>Let me be clear, we support the prudent use of taxpayers&#146; money, and if 35 per cent is the Government&#146;s appraisal of risk, that is what should drive the haircuts; but the Government must come clean on their risk assessment. Will the Minister tell the House what view the Government have on the risks inherent in the current mortgage book of UK banks and building societies and their European counterparts?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0804215000133"></a>The eligible collateral is restricted to AAA-rated securities, but the Government have been critical of the rating agencies. The Prime Minister said that we need to,</p>
<ul><a name="0804215000352"></a>&#147;sort out the credit rating agencies and the mistakes that they have made&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000134"></a>What changes have been made to sort out the credit rating agencies to stop them making mistakes? I am not aware of any changes, so what credence can we place on the AAA ratings that are required? Is this a tacit acceptance that the Government can come up with no better way of appraising the quality of the securities that taxpayer money will be backing?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0804215000135"></a>The eligible securities within the special liquidity scheme seem on the whole to be sensible, and we support the exclusion of securities linked to US mortgages, but can the Minister explain the inclusion of credit card-backed securities? Why have the Government allowed US credit card-backed securities to be included? What is the rationale for excluding US mortgages but including US credit card debts?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0804215000136"></a>Will the Minister say how the Bank of England is going to make sure that this new facility is propping up sound banks and not another Northern Rock? The Financial Services Authority is responsible for banking regulation and the Bank has little information about individual banks. Will the Bank be carrying out due diligence on banks before it agrees to deal with them at the window? Does the FSA have any role in this? If it does, how can the Bank and the Government be sure that the judgments made by the FSA are sound, especially given the outcome of the report on its disastrous handling of Northern Rock?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0804215000137"></a>Tackling inter-bank liquidity is important but so too is the strength of banks&#146; balance sheets&#151;the Minister referred to this in his Statement. We have heard about the possible rights issue by Royal Bank of Scotland. What are the Government and the FSA doing to ensure that banks play their part in strengthening their balance sheets, whether through additional capital or retained profits? We heard in the Statement about international discussions, but what practical steps are the Government taking in this country?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0804215000138"></a>This announcement is a helpful step forward. It remains to be seen whether it will have the effects that the Government desire and it raises as many questions as it answers. I hope that the Minister will answer the questions that I have put to him.</p>

I think that all noble Lords would agree that we are now in a rather bizarre situation. After years in which the banks were trying to persuade all of us to take out bigger and bigger overdrafts, the Government have now in effect created a massive overdraft facility for the banks. We are seriously concerned that in doing so the Chancellor has exposed the taxpayer to the risks of a massive bank bail-out.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0804215000140"></a>As to how we got to this position, a number of things are clear. The banks have in some respects been helpful about it. By their own testimony through their representative body, the Institute of International Finance, they have been guilty of,</p>
<ul><a name="0804215000353"></a>&#147;major points of weakness in business practice&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000290"></a>including massive levels of pay, bonuses up to  10 times basic salaries and serious shortcomings in the management of risk. They are not simply passive victims of bad luck. British banks lent too much too quickly and too carelessly. The big losses with which they are now faced must be identified by them and then covered by bank shareholders. That is the way in which trust will be restored and interbank lending resumed at acceptable levels. However, it is clear that going back to the shareholders is an extremely unpalatable option for many bank executives, not least because they fear that they may lose their jobs if they do. It is much easier to go to the Government and get a bail-out from them.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0804215000141"></a>The Chancellor has pointed out that the taxpayer is protected because bank assets will be transferred at a discount. The noble Baroness asked a number of questions about this, but we need to know how big a discount we are talking about. Given that the IMF has judged that the housing market may be 25 per cent to 30 per cent overvalued, any discount of less than 30 per cent appears at face value to place the taxpayer at significant risk. Can we therefore have an assurance that the discount will be at least at that level? The Bank of England has said that it expects that the initial take-up will be &#163;50 billion. Is there any sense anywhere of what the final take-up will be? Have the Bank and the Government in effect given an open-ended commitment that they will make available as much money as the banks need?</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0804215000142"></a>If there is to be any departure, as it appears there may be, from the traditional terms on which the Bank of England lends to the banks, it is only reasonable that new tough and binding conditions should be placed on the banks rather than the extremely vague assurances about future behaviour that we have heard today. We suggest three conditions for the new facility. The first is that bank shareholders, not the taxpayer, should pay for the losses from previous bank lending. This means rights issues to raise shareholder capital. It appears that the Royal Bank of Scotland is taking the lead in taking such a step, but our view is that other banks should be eligible for funding from this source only if they also commit themselves to the same course of action. Otherwise, the banks simply pocket the Bank of England&#146;s money to boost their reserves rather than lending it on.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0804215000143"></a>Secondly, the banks must be willing to sign up to a set of procedures that prevent large-scale repossessions and that are binding not only on the larger and more socially responsible banks, which would probably do this anyway, but on every bank that takes advantage of this facility. We are grateful that the Government at least now acknowledge for the first time that there may be a repossession problem, but it is important that, having acknowledged it, they work with the banks to ensure that repossessions are kept to a minimum.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0804215000144"></a>Thirdly&#151;this is a more long-term point&#151;surely boom-and-bust lending cycles must be countered in future by more proactive intervention by the Bank of England that requires the banks to hold higher reserves during boom periods. The Government cannot prevent the current housing bubble from bursting, but they must ensure that these bursts of irresponsible lending do not happen again.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0804215000145"></a>The Bank of England is giving generous support to help banks to get out of a mess that is entirely of their own making, but the banks must now take the firm action that is needed to return to sound banking practices to ensure that they do not repeat the excesses of recent years.</p>

I understand the general anxieties expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, but I thought that I had made it clear in my Statement, as I will seek to do when I refer specifically to the questions asked by the noble Baroness, that the Bank is taking scrupulous care to ensure that the banks, not the taxpayer, will take responsibility for the situation in which they find themselves. The Bank of England will ensure that the collateral that is provided is in excess of the resources made available to the banks in order to ensure that there cannot be a bill at the end for the taxpayer. That is the principle on which the scheme will operate. In articulating that obvious anxiety, which the Government share and which the Bank of England has taken care in its proposals to allay, the noble Lord should accept that the risk will be taken by the banks and their shareholders and not by the British taxpayer. I emphasise that point particularly as it is the principle that underpins the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0804215000148"></a>I also hear what the noble Lord says about the mortgage market and the difficulties that individuals are in. That is exactly why my right honourable friend the Chancellor is holding meetings tomorrow with the mortgage lenders. He will discuss with them the impact of the tightening position on credit, particularly as it affects those on fixed-term mortgages that are coming to an end. It is expected that these discussions will be fruitful on how we can enhance protection for banks and building societies so that they can offer various

The noble Lord will recognise that repossession levels are low in comparison with the housing crisis in 1991. Nevertheless, they are increasing and any increase is worrying. It is important to have strategies that reduce the likelihood of repossession. I want to assure the noble Lord on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0804215000149"></a>The noble Baroness asked me a number of questions and made a number of statements, one or two of which I felt were a shade controversial. I do not accept that there was dithering over Northern Rock. As we discussed at the time&#151;</p>

However, they clearly did not, unless this side of the House is being asked to believe that noble Lords opposite&#151;not too explicitly, but secretly&#151;hoped for the early public ownership of Northern Rock, which is a contention that I find somewhat dubious, to put it at its mildest. Noble Lords opposite only ever emerged with the suggestion that Lloyds TSB had a proposal way back last August that would have solved all the problems. Such a proposal would have fallen at the first fence of state aid in Brussels. It was never realistic. Therefore, anyone who believes that noble Lords opposite, their party or their leadership in the other place have ever put forward a credible proposition to deal with the situation earlier than we did, under the terms that we have and guaranteeing stability for the bank and the wider financial system, is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Noble Lords opposite can make those contentions but those contentions are treated outside with the derision that they deserve.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0804215000152"></a>Nevertheless, the noble Baroness was right to ask me about the relationship between improved and increased liquidity, the mortgage market and the position for the ordinary mortgage holder. We have two objectives. One is to secure financial stability so that the banks can carry out interbank trading, which we all recognise is restricted in a way that is causing grievous difficulties for all forms of credit. But there is a particular problem for the mortgage market and mortgage holders, which is why the Chancellor has made it absolutely clear that he is taking additional measures on this and why we are having discussions with mortgage lenders tomorrow.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0804215000153"></a>There will be a second broad outcome from these proposals beyond the improvements in financial liquidity that will feed through the system and improve the capacity for loans at lower rates. In addition, there is a specific problem for mortgage holders and a short-term problem for many as their mortgage terms come to an end, which is why we are holding discussions with mortgage lenders to seek to make provisions that take into account the short-term needs of such individuals.</p>

That is why we intend to take action on credit rating. However, it is a worldwide issue, which is why what action to take is being discussed at the international level. The problem is not easy to resolve. Given that, while the noble Baroness has the right to ask me the question, she is also obliged to recognise that there is no flip answer.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0804215000155"></a>So far as the Bank of England is concerned, it will be necessary for it not only to take as collateral only that which is highly rated according to existing credit rating, but in addition to become involved in further searches beyond that. The Bank cannot automatically assume that a triple-A credit rating provides the safeguard and benefit that otherwise we would have hoped it did. In other words, the Bank is all too well aware of the issue. When taking these positions as collateral, it will be obliged to examine them with the greatest care&#151;and that applies to all the other aspects of credit rating. The noble Baroness referred in particular to credit card-backed securities. Some of those can be entirely secure, and the Bank of England will be reassured on that front. Where there are doubts, the Bank has made it clear that, when it takes more collateral, the value of that collateral will be higher than the resources that it makes available in order to safeguard the public and the taxpayer against any default.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0804215000156"></a>The noble Baroness asked me a number of other pertinent questions. She emphasised her concern about the rise in assessments for haircuts. We all know that this is an important aspect of the scheme, so I say to her only that the Bank of England, which is used to managing these issues, will need to take great care in this area. It is the Bank&#146;s business to do so. I emphasise that this is a Bank of England scheme in which the Bank takes responsibility on behalf of the public for the assessments that it makes on the scheme&#146;s operation. The noble Baroness asked how the FSA can be trusted in its role, given its past record. I hope that she and her colleagues will pay due regard to the action taken by the FSA to improve the quality of its work.</p>

<a name="80421-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0804215000157"></a>I apologise to the House. The noble Baroness asked me a volley of questions, but I have exceeded my time and I must abide by the rules of the House. I therefore also apologise to the noble Baroness and undertake to write to her on the points that I have not covered.</p>

For example, should we not also be talking to the accountancy bodies? Has my noble friend noticed that the banks, which I agree should be more transparent, published accounts with clear audit certificates but within a short time of doing so wrote off billions of pounds? Can he try to find out why a clear audit certificate was given? Moreover, is he aware that mortgage lenders are charging householders up to &#163;1,000 for renewal of mortgages? That surely seems excessive, although perhaps he should also talk to solicitors

There is one other point that the Chancellor may think worth considering during his discussions with mortgage lenders. The point about repossessions was made by the noble Lord on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. Will the mortgage lenders be able to give any assurances on that front during the meeting tomorrow?</p>

We all recognise that there may be circumstances in which houses need to be repossessed; we also recognise that that cuts off the flow of repayments from the individuals concerned when it is better for society for them to retain their homes and perhaps to have temporary assistance until circumstances improve and they are able to resume repayments. These issues will be discussed with mortgage lenders tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0804215000160"></a>On the more general issue of what is wrong with a range of professions and professional activity in our society, I am not sure how much of that can fall within the framework of this rather humble Statement, but I hear what the noble Lord says that part of our difficulties may have occurred from the fact that the audit of banks has been less rigorous than it might have been. I also hear that his next target may well be solicitors who arrange mortgages. But sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. I have already indicated what action the Government intend to take on the broad issues consonant with his statement.</p>

As the banks cannot get rid of their mortgage-based assets because other banks do not believe what they say they are worth, how will the Bank of England decide how much collateral concerns any particular securitised package? Further, has the National Audit Office been considered for an appropriate method of valuation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0804215000162"></a>Secondly, where will these figures appear in government figures? Thirdly, as it is likely that much of the refinancing of the banks is going to come from sovereign wealth funds overseas&#151;which may mean that the effect of this crisis is that huge chunks of the British banking system and the City of London are taken into foreign ownership&#151;have the Government any specific proposals on policy with regard to sovereign wealth funds?</p>

What is important at this stage is that the practicalities of the operation of the scheme should be effective. The bank will need all its resources in its evaluation in those terms, together with the FSA where it has expertise to contribute. Of course the Bank of England is more aware than any institution in the country of the problems on credit ratings with regard to assets and of what the banks currently offer with a range of assets which are either unquantifiable or maybe rated much lower than the banks had hitherto thought them to be. But the Bank of England will require collateral which it can verify meets the requirements of safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer.</p>

Can the noble Lord assure the House that the banks&#146; take-up of this accommodation is subject to two specific matters; first, that the moneys concerned should be hypothecated to assisting mortagees and would-be mortgagees as otherwise the whole thrust of the Government&#146;s initiative becomes purposeless? Secondly, taking up the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, about transparency, it is perfectly clear that a situation is developing whereby the intentions in the Companies Acts with regard to the auditing of accounts are being frustrated, either deliberately or for some other reason. Nevertheless, it should be made clear that there has to be the most candid expression of the calculation of losses that have occurred due to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market. Indeed, there should be a reasonable appreciation and calculation of the likely contingent losses. Otherwise, there will be a continuing loss of confidence and the whole disclosure system that the Companies Acts guarantee will have been brought into desuetude.</p>

It is that element which this scheme seeks to remedy by providing additional resources to increase financial liquidity, thereby reducing inter-bank lending rates and in due course helping the general position as regards the total cost of borrowing. The noble Lord will appreciate that the Chancellor was at pains to emphasise that he wants to meet mortgage lenders tomorrow to discuss the very real problem that exists in the mortgage market and for ordinary individuals caught up in these very difficult circumstances. However, this scheme cannot be hypothecated to the mortgage market. It is designed on a much broader canvas than that in terms

Will he answer the key question put by both Front and Back Benches: what haircut is being taken and how was it calculated? What is the Government&#146;s assumption about the biggest fall in house prices that can occur? We are entitled to know that, when more than &#163;50 billion of our money is being put on the line on that assumption. Can the Minister say what the haircut will be? Can he also explain how these huge sums of money will be provided off-balance-sheet? The Statement said that the Treasury was providing a guarantee. If there is a guarantee, there is a liability. Why is that not on the Government&#146;s books? This is Enron-style accounting which will get us into considerable difficulties.</p>

<a name="80421-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0804215000168"></a>The Minister said in an aside about those who had advocated the Lloyds TSB solution in the summer that it would have fallen at the first fence because of state aid. Lloyds TSB asked for &#163;30 billion and for it to be secured on the loan book. If that would fall at the first fence because of state aid, why will not this scheme?</p>

The noble Lord will recognise that the Bank of England is following patterns which have already been carried out by the European Central Bank and by the Fed and therefore the issue is entirely different from that of one particular institution, as Lloyds TSB is and was last summer when it put forward its proposal which would have raised issues of state aid. I do not in any way, shape or form resile from my position. With regard to the elaborate fiction which the noble Lord manages to portray through the sharpness of his questioning, I notice that it is not often sustained by his Front Bench as being the solution which all ought to have pursued at that time. I have not at any stage seen the Conservative Party prepared to indicate that, had they been in power by last September, the whole issue of Northern Rock would have been solved in a trice by their approach. It just will not do. The proposal was only a proposal; it never really reached first base in terms of a bid; it was vulnerable to the judgments of Europe and it did not go any further. Quite frankly that is a hare that will not run for the noble Lord. I am coming on to haircuts in a moment.</p>

The Bank of England will be required to assure itself that the collateral which it takes is valid and viable. Some areas may not match the criteria needed by the Bank, but for the banking system as a whole, there is no doubt that the additional liquidity, which the Bank has been making available in any case on a shorter term basis as part of its normal operations, is of assistance in these difficult times.</p>

The suggestion that in their past actions the Government have been involved in a soft bail-out for those who have made mistakes is just not right in the illustration of Northern Rock. With regard to Lloyds TSB, of course it did not go before Brussels. It was never a proposal; it was not much more than an inquiry and a position put forward which would have failed at the first fence. As far as the Government are concerned, that is as far as it went. The noble Lord has to give the Government credit. If there had been an easy solution from a bank last August&#151;a proposal that would have dealt with Northern Rock&#151;is he seriously suggesting that the Government would have gone through six months of harassment over the issue?

However, we have an obligation to sustain the wider financial institutions in a way that guarantees to each and every one of us and to our fellow citizens the necessary resources. Within that, the Government are acting to protect taxpayers and at the same time to increase the necessarily liquidity, which is not there at present, which is why the banks are in this mess.</p>

<a name="80421-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0804215000204"></a>Amendment No. 69 has been tabled in response to the debate on the amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, which sought to allow for a young offender to receive a second referral order where the youth offending team or other appropriate body recommended one . We had a detailed debate on the merits of allowing a second referral order in which I made clear the Government&#146;s concern that we must retain the integrity and effectiveness of the referral order. The order is targeted primarily at young offenders appearing in court for the first time who plead guilty to the offence, and it has the lowest reconviction rate at 44 per cent. We are anxious not to undermine its success. We are already making provision in the Bill to allow a referral to be made on a second conviction where a referral order has not been made previously and we are also easing some of the restrictions placed on its use. We have also responded to the debate in another place by adding flexibility to the referral order so that an order may be extended by three months or revoked early in appropriate circumstances where the youth offender panel recommends this to the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0804215000205"></a>I have listened carefully to the arguments put forward in Committee and this proposed amendment is the result. It addresses both the concern put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the Government&#146;s concern that a second referral order should not become the norm. I have accepted that there will be circumstances where it will be appropriate for a young offender to receive a second referral order; for instance, where a significant time has elapsed since they first underwent the referral process. However, requiring that this should happen only in exceptional circumstances and where the

We have consulted with the Youth Justice Board, which agrees with what the Government are proposing. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will feel that I have gone at least a considerable way to meeting his point. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0804215000213"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Clause 42 is intended to deal with a very narrow range of cases where a conviction is referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission on the ground that there has been a change of law since the conviction.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0804215000214"></a>The existing practice of the Court of Appeal is clear in cases in general. When an appeal is based on a change in law, the appellant will almost always need leave to appeal out of time. That is the nature of such cases; they often do not arise until long after the conviction. The court will almost always refuse leave to appeal in those cases unless the appeal is itself extremely meritorious, so the conviction is upheld. That is the solution in all ordinary cases based on a change of law and it is a solution that works very well. But it does not work when the appeal is referred to the Court of Appeal by the CCRC. In such cases the appellant does not need leave to appeal, so the filter that is currently operated by the Court of Appeal is ineffective. Clause 42 is intended to deal with that very narrow range of cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0804215000215"></a>The trouble with Clause 42, which emerged clearly in Committee, is that it is almost impossibly wide as it stands. It would cause great difficulty to the practising Bar&#151;a point made well by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;and it would cause the academic lawyers to have a collective heart attack. The Government now accept this, and as a result discussions have taken place between what are called interested parties, including Professor Zellick, the current chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0804215000216"></a>It was the judiciary that first suggested that the problem, such as it is&#151;and I emphasise that it is a very small problem&#151;should be subject to legislation. For that reason the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, whom I am glad to see in his place, suggested that I have a word with the president of the Queen&#146;s Bench Division, which indeed I did. He and I agreed on a form of words which in my view&#151;and, much more importantly, in his view&#151;meets the particular difficulty that gave rise to this clause and, hence, to this amendment. The amendment would solve the problem in a neat and straightforward way and I had hoped that it would be accepted as it stands.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0804215000217"></a>The Government now say, believe it or not, that my amendment is too wide. They have gone from one extreme to the other. The original proposal was impossibly wide and now they say that my very narrow amendment is too wide. They say that it might cause difficulty&#151;note &#147;might&#148;&#151;when a conviction is referred to the Court of Appeal by the CCRC on two or more grounds, only one of which is based on a change of law. They accept that that difficulty, such as it is, is theoretical; but despite a flurry of e-mails between the noble and learned Lord and myself in the past few days, I cannot for the life of me see what the difficulty is. I very much look forward to hearing from him. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

My appreciation of what goes on there is of absolutely no interest to anybody. But I am a little worried. If the law changes, are you really going to be put out in the interests of doing justice, broadly? I cannot put it another way. It seems to me to go against the grain&#151;although if it goes with the grain of the academics, I could not care less. I am interested in justice, not the interests of the academics. There is a distinction to be drawn between a development in the law and the development of the means of getting evidence to enforce it. That is an important distinction. It should never be foreclosed upon by the Appellate Committee of the House. It has not done so and I do not suppose that it will do so, but would it and where does this lead us?

Clause 42 amends Section 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 to give the Court of Appeal a discretion to disregard developments in the law since the date of conviction. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, is concerned that the clause is too wide in its effect. We understand his concern to be that it would allow the Court of Appeal to disregard the law as it is now in any case where it was considering whether a conviction was unsafe, in whatever manner the case reached the court, and whether a development in the law was one of the grounds of appeal. The matter has been discussed with the noble and learned Lord, and we have been exploring the possibility of reducing the ambit of the clause to make clear that it applies only to cases referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0804215000225"></a>We are broadly sympathetic to the objectives of the noble and learned Lord&#146;s Amendments Nos. 70A, 71A and 72A. In addition to limiting the scope of the clause to referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, they also limit the court&#146;s power to dismiss the appeal to cases in which it would have refused leave out of time. We are not sure whether the latter limitation is essential, but it does have the merit of signalling&#151;at least to the alert reader&#151;that cases referred by the commission are in fact to be dealt with in the same way as other cases.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0804215000226"></a>However, with the greatest respect to the noble and learned Lord, we have some concerns about the drafting of the provision. The difficulty is that it would apply whenever a case is referred by the CCRC on the grounds that there has been a change in the law, even if it is also referred by the CCRC on other grounds. In such a case, it would seem to give the court a new power to dismiss any of the grounds of appeal, even grounds that have nothing to do with the change of law and even if the appeal might succeed on the merits. No doubt we can rely on the Court of Appeal not to use the power in an unreasonable manner, but it seems preferable that the power to dismiss should explicitly be confined to appeals which turn on a change in the law rather than the wider category of appeals which are referred on a change in the law.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0804215000227"></a>I entirely agree that it might seem churlish to look at the Rolls-Royce drafting and turn it aside, but there is simply a small technical point on which we would take issue with the proposal as it stands. We would perhaps have thought that a repenting sinner would receive a greater welcome than the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has extended. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, that the approach adopted here on changes in the law is precisely to deal with the concern that one would be moving into a difficult area where one might not arrive at the just outcome. It was simply for that reason that we have been persuaded by the arguments deployed.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0804215000228"></a>A second technical difficulty is that when the court is considering an out-of-time appeal it has two preliminary decisions to make: first, whether to extend time; and, secondly, whether to grant leave to appeal. We do not think that it is sufficient for the clause to refer to,</p>
<ul><a name="0804215000354"></a>&#147;leave to appeal out of time&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0804215000291"></a>which, with respect, may conflate these two issues.</p>

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0804215000229"></a>For those reasons, we do not think that the noble and learned Lord&#146;s amendments quite do the trick. We consider that the clause should operate where, first, the case has been referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission; and, secondly, where the fact that there has been a development in the law since the date of conviction is the only basis for allowing the appeal. We would be content also to limit the power to dismiss the appeal to cases in which the court would have refused an extension of time. A clause amended in this way would achieve our objective, which is to secure that the Court of Appeal should no longer find itself compelled to quash the conviction in the relevant cases. If that outcome would be satisfactory to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and to those

<a name="80421-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0804215000231"></a>On the Minister&#146;s reply, I am of course glad that the Government now accept that the existing clause is far too wide. He suggests that my amendment is still too wide, because it would enable the Court of Appeal to dismiss an appeal that has merit and which it would not otherwise dismiss but allow because it is conjoined with another ground of appeal that happens to be based on change of law. I do not understand that. It is not just a question that the Court of Appeal would never in its life do such a silly thing but it is not something that flows from the language of my amendment as I see it.</p>

During Committee stage I indicated that we were carefully considering the issue of the current restriction on the use of youth conditional cautions to 16 and 17 year-olds. We have now had the opportunity to reflect on the arguments made by noble Lords. We have been persuaded by them and we have therefore tabled government amendments designed to remove the age restriction, so that this out-of-court disposal will be available to all young people. I hope that the House will welcome this move. I also hope that the House will acknowledge that the Government&#146;s approach to a staged implementation is the most appropriate course to take. Initially, we intend to introduce youth conditional cautions for 16 to 17 year-olds. There is no question that applying youth conditional cautions for 10 to 15 year-olds will give rise to a different set of challenges, so we wish to learn from the application of this new out of court disposal to the higher age range and consult widely before extending the Bill&#146;s provisions to the 10 to 15 age group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0804215000268"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment has come to us by way of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. Its purpose is to treat under-18 year-olds as children and young people. During the final days in Committee, we debated the issue in several different guises.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0804215000269"></a>The argument is that the Bill fails to address the continued treatment of 17 year-olds as adults for the purposes of bail and remand. It means that at court, 17 year-olds cannot be remanded to local authority accommodation and are automatically remanded to custody if bail is denied.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0804215000270"></a>In their response to the consultation paper, <I>Youth Justice&#151;The Next Steps,</I> published in March 2004, the Government first stated their intention to address the situation. The Bail Act 1976 applies in its entirety to children and young people and that throws up the anomaly that those who are 17 years old are still dealt with under adult provisions for the purposes of bail and remand. Therefore, when bail is refused they are automatically rendered in custody and do not have the protective buffer of the option of remand to local authority accommodation and are not subsequently looked after.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0804215000271"></a>That means that where the court feels that bail cannot be granted due to the risk of future non-attendance at court appearances, a 17 year-old must be remanded in custody, whereas a 16 year-old would have other options. The Youth Justice Board has supplied statistics indicating that during 2005 and 2006 there were 6,561 episodes of 17 year-olds being remanded in custody. That is a considerable number.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0804215000272"></a>There are also human rights considerations. In response to the UK Government&#146;s report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 2002, the UN committee on that convention recommended that the state party&#151;our Government&#151;review the status of young people 17 years of age for the purposes of remand, with a view to giving special protection to all children under the age of 18. The Standing Committee for Youth Justice points out that there are no obvious grounds for distinguishing between 16 and 17 year-olds in respect of bail and remand decisions. Therefore, the current system may well be seen to be in breach of Article 14, which requires equal treatment on the basis of age.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0804215000273"></a>When this issue was raised in Committee, the Minister said that the issue was not straightforward, and I can see that. He said that there was a catalogue of linking factors that our amendments at that stage did not cover. He mentioned in particular the status of 17 year-olds under police bail, which is covered by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. He felt that we would need to re-examine that as well. I accept that we do not cover all the interlinked issues. This is a very limited amendment&#151;that is why we are keeping it as narrow as we are. Were there a Bill before us that dealt with policing issues, we would certainly raise it in that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1292"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>context. When such a Bill comes forward, I guarantee that we will return to these issues in that forum. The point is that where we are on this Bill is not where we might wish to be. We are trying to get the Government to accept that we need a response. It has now been a considerable length of time. I understand that it is a complex issue and that they have been looking at it, but we need to move a little further. I beg to move.</p>

I note that the Standing Committee for Youth Justice produced a compelling paper, arguing in her favour. The philosophies of that paper and the proposed amendment are identical. The Government are denying themselves an important degree of flexibility in dealing with this class of offenders, which is open to them in dealing with adult offenders. That seems puzzling when you consider that more informal ways of dealing with offences for the under-18s generally have a better impact with respect to recidivism than court-imposed penalties. That the Government have not conceded that this approach is the better one just adds to one&#146;s amazement.</p>

To raise this age from 17 to 18 seems to go down that line. A distinguished judge said to me the other day, &#147;I know prison doesn&#146;t work&#151;but Michael, what am I to do?&#148; That seems to sum up the problems that we have with prison. What we know is that the less you mix the older with the younger, the better. For that reason, I support the noble Baroness in her argument.</p>

We do not dispute the logic of the noble Baroness in moving her amendment. It is an anomaly that  17 year-olds are treated as adults for remand placement purposes, but as children in every other part of the youth justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0804215000278"></a>During the debate in Committee, we voiced our sympathy with the thrust of the amendment, and I do so again today. I also set out the steps that had been taken to look at this issue and the complexities that had been uncovered that had prevented us from so far reaching an acceptable solution. Unfortunately, there  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1293"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are complexities. We know that the issue needs to be resolved. Our public response to the consultation <I>Youth Justice: The Next Steps</I> has made that commitment public. As the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, was right to remind the House, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child has identified this issue as requiring resolution. We have accepted our obligation to consider how we can do that. We will not lose sight of this issue and we will pursue a resolution of the problem.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0804215000279"></a>We have already undertaken work to explore how we can correct this anomaly. The aim of this work echoed entirely the sentiment behind the amendment. It looked at replication of the remand placement structure for 12 to 16 year-olds for 17 year-olds. However, this has proved to be more problematic than merely changing the age in the current legislation as the amendment does. I say, with regret, that we have yet to find a workable solution.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0804215000280"></a>The test for bail is essential the same for both adults and young people, and it is not the subject of the amendment. The central issue is the placement of those aged 17. If the offender is remanded in custody, for 17 year-olds in practice it will be in a young offender institution and those aged 16 and under will normally be remanded to the care of the local authority. The amendment seeks to bring 17 year-olds into line with the provisions applying for young people aged 16 and under. In practice, that would mean that if the court orders a secure remand, a  17 year-old would be placed either in a secure training centre or a local authority secure children&#146;s home. However, if remanded to the care of the local authority, the decision on the placement then lies with it, and the placement could be secure or non-secure, and it could include them living at home.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0804215000281"></a>In an ideal world, we would want 17 year-olds to have similar options. However&#151;this is critical&#151;we do not believe that they should be placed routinely in children&#146;s homes, because Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 also provides for the placement of the very youngest and most vulnerable young people into local authority accommodation. We rely on the argument made in part by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, just now, that we do not want to mix up the very young with 17 year-olds in children&#146;s homes. We do not think it appropriate to introduce  17 year-olds to local authority accommodation and to allow them to mix with a vulnerable group of younger children, particularly those who are there for welfare reasons alone.</p>

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="0804215000282"></a><a name="80421-0007.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80421-0007.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="0804215000775"></a>The Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, that is exactly the argument that I did not use. The argument that I used was that to put 17 year-olds with older criminals is wrong, not the other way around. It is essential in my view that they should not be mixed with older criminals and the Government seem to have accepted that but, like St Augustine, they say, &#147;Make me chaste; but not just yet&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1294"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not mix. The argument against putting 17 year-olds in children&#146;s homes is that they would then mix with vulnerable children aged perhaps from 11 upwards, or maybe even younger than that. That is why I prayed in aid his argument. We do not deny its validity&#151;in fact what I am saying now accepts its validity&#151;but other options have to be considered. It is not a straightforward issue. We fear that the amendment is a little too simple and does not take into account the other interlinking factors that are equally important and which must be addressed alongside this issue. We spoke to the Standing Committee for Youth Justice on this subject following the Committee stage in this House. It is aware of the complexities involved and takes the point I have just made. We have already discussed with the standing committee how it might assist us in taking this matter forward.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08042114000001"></a>I shall set out again&#151;as briefly as I can, as I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House, although this is an important topic&#151;what other factors will have to be considered if we are to change the remand status of 17 year-olds. First, consideration would need to be given to the status of 17 year-olds under police bail, which is covered by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Any change in this provision may increase demand for juvenile accommodation in police custody suites because, as the House will know, young people have to be separated from adults in police detention and females have to be under the care of a woman officer. This has special relevance in this context because of the read-across to the provision of appropriate adults under Code C and the status of  17 year-olds under this Act. The House will want to know that the Home Office is currently reviewing the codes under PACE and we will need to ensure that this is addressed. We also need to look at the care status of young people under such a provision.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08042114000002"></a>Finally, and most important, we need to consider the impact of any changes to 17 year-old remand status on the Bail Act itself. If we are to consider making changes to that important legislation, we need to ensure that they are undertaken in a coherent and consistent manner. We need to consider what the consequences of such changes will be. One issue has already been identified: under this amendment,  17 year-olds who are likely to interfere with witnesses and have been refused bail might end up with a non-secure remand. Noble Lords will agree that that cannot be right and that we would be failing in our duty to protect victims and the public if we did not address that issue.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08042114000003"></a>We are very aware of our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the commitment that we made following our response to the document <I>Youth Justice</I><I>&#151;</I><I>The Next Steps</I>. I say again that we will review how we can ensure that  17 year-olds are treated appropriately for the purposes of remand, but such a review has to be done as a whole so that it takes into account all the relevant issues. It is thus with regret that I cannot agree to this amendment on behalf of the Government, but I assure the noble Baroness and the House that we will continue working in order to change what I have already conceded is an anomaly that needs to be changed.</p>

It is clear that there is growing concern over the increase in custodial rates and the poor outcomes associated with young people being held in custody. During the debate on the previous amendment tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Kingsland, on which we divided, the Minister mentioned the Carter review and reminded us that there was a genuine attempt by the Government to reduce numbers in custody.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08042114000005"></a>Philosophically, we can go down this road where we all acknowledge that custody does not work for everyone. We particularly recognise that in the case of young people. Throughout the weeks that the Bill has been in this House, we have recognised that custody is often deleterious and that people who are locked up as young people or children are more likely to end up in custody as adults. During the debate on the previous amendment, the Minister reiterated that there was a genuine attempt to bring down numbers, yet it is now four years since a consultation paper, the responses to it and the Government&#146;s promise that  we would look at this. For a young person who was  17 then and who was incarcerated, it has been a very long four years&#151;25 per cent of their life&#151;of waiting. That part of the person&#146;s life has gone, damaged  as it is.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para18"></a>

We have our international commitments, for which we have fine words, but there is little point in signing up to international conventions if we are not really going to take them seriously and incorporate them into law. The Minister&#146;s emollient words are there for the record and I have absolutely no doubt that he is completely sincere, but this is, I am afraid, a counsel of despair. We are still where we are and, I say with all due respect to those fine words, we do not have any commitment to look at this in the round within a certain timeframe and to bring in measures. That is why I was keen to table even a limited amendment that addressed this. I thought that it was better to move forward in a very limited way than to go beyond this into policing and other areas. However, we are where we are, and given the extremely long list of business ahead of us this evening, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The Social Exclusion Unit found in 2002 that nearly half the children in custody had literacy and numeracy levels lower than those of an average 11 year-old. More than half of them had a history of being in the care of social services and 40 per cent of girls and 25 per cent of boys reported suffering violence at home. One in three girls and one in  20 boys reported sexual abuse. Again, there were serious mental health problems among both boys and girls, as well as a dependency on the drug culture.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08042114000012"></a>As my noble friend Lord Carlile reported in his 2006 independent inquiry, published by the Howard League, into the use of physical restraint, solitary confinement and the forcible use of strip-searching in prisons, secure training centres and local authority secure children&#146;s homes, some treatment of children in custody would in any other circumstances trigger a child protection investigation and could even result in criminal charges. For vulnerable children who suffer from the problems that I have outlined, it is extremely important that detention settings should be child-centred and specialised to their needs.</p>

<a name="80421-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08042114000013"></a>Young offender institutions and STCs are not tailored to meet the needs of vulnerable children. Efforts must be focused on alternatives to custody but, where custody is necessary, there must be investment in specialist staff and settings that can meet the children&#146;s needs and facilitate their rehabilitation in a safe environment. It must not be forgotten that the Prison Service is essentially an adult institution. It is designed for adults, who are 96 per cent of its clientele. That is reflected in arrangements for management, staffing, training and regime content. We submit that holding children in Prison Service accommodation is in direct contravention

It is a long-standing problem, but recent reports from the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers, show how important it is. In 2006, she reported of her concern about the use of force on children in prison. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="08042114000082"></a>&#147;In many establishments, a significant proportion of child protection referrals concern allegations of abuse or rough handling during the use of force; some have resulted in injuries, such as broken bones&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042114000070"></a>In her 2005-06 report, she said of these issues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="08042114000083"></a>&#147;Underlying these ... is the question of whether prison is the right, or appropriate, environment for many of the young people who end up there ... in growing numbers which siphon off the resources needed to provide appropriate mental health services, and other support mechanisms and interventions, in the community&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08042114000015"></a>The YOIs clearly are not settings specifically applicable to children and their use for custody for children should be stopped. It is a goal that will be hard to achieve with the currently unjustifiable high level of children&#146;s custody and there should be a drive to reduce the child custodial population. We hope that this amendment will find favour with your Lordships and that, as a result, no person under 18 shall be detained any longer in a young offender institution. I beg to move.</p>

I know that I said this on the previous amendment, but I shall probably say it again and again, because it is mad. It is counterproductive and does not do any good. The only way anything can be done for these wretched children is through education and care, with attention to their mental health, their drug problems and so on. They should not be banged up in adult prisons under any circumstances whatever. In the 21st century, we should not be doing that and we are not a civilised country if we go on doing it. For those reasons, I support the Liberal Democrats. The less we do it, the cheaper it will be. Possibly, we would keep a few more out of permanent trouble, which is what we should always be trying to do.</p>

The time has come for the Government to accept that no 18 year-old should be detained in a prison setting. I am only sorry that there are not more noble Lords who have spoken previously on this issue to set out the position more forcefully than has been the case today.</p>

As have so many Members of your Lordships&#146; House on so many occasions, I point out that we in England and Wales bear the legal shame so far as western Europe is concerned on the incarceration of children. I have said many times before, and I make no apology for repeating it, that on a pro rata basis we incarcerate more children than Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway put together.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08042114000021"></a>There are huge problems, of course. If these young people are not to be incarcerated in the institutions that exist at the moment, where are they to be put? In many cases local authorities do not have secure accommodation facilities for children and young persons, so if the only practical alternative is to place them in children&#146;s homes, I can see the problem; indeed, it was articulated by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, in relation to the earlier amendment.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08042114000022"></a>The question is therefore what might be called contaminatory influences. If a 17 year-old is placed in a children&#146;s home with children of the age of 11 upwards, how much contamination is experienced and suffered by the younger ones through that person&#146;s presence? If, on the other hand, that 17 year-old is placed with an 18 year-old in a different sort of institution and where the 18 year-old may well be a much more shell-backed criminal altogether, how do we gauge that level of contamination? I appreciate that it is a difficult issue. However, I applaud the general principle that we should use every possible artifice, exercise our imagination and expend all our energy to ensure that we send fewer children to prison.</p>

In fact, we are not talking about sending children aged 18 to adult prisons. As I understand it, the amendment concerns secure accommodation, young offender institutions and secure training centres. But what my noble friend has said is absolutely right: it is a question of the lack of resources at the local level for local secure accommodation. That is what is needed. One or two people have to be taken away from the community; there is no doubt about that. I do not know how many noble Lords have been, as I have, to young offender institutions and to secure training centres. I have been to both. They are not the dreadful places that they are made out to be. The standard of some of the staff is extremely high. However, the basic fact is that sufficient resources are not available at the local level for secure local authority places.</p>

<a name="08042114000024"></a><a name="80421-0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80421-0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042114000297"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 81 is similar to the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, in Committee. We had a full and passionate debate then, as we have had this afternoon in perhaps a smaller way. A number of concerns were expressed, with the emphasis very much on what remains to be done.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08042114000025"></a>Let me point out briefly what the Government have done over the past few years to ensure that young people under 18 are accommodated entirely separately from young adults and older prisoners. Perhaps the key development was the decision in April 2000 to give the Youth Justice Board responsibility for oversight of the secure estate for children and young people. The board immediately established a discrete estate for boys under 18&#151;in other words, one in which they did not have contact with anyone in custody over that age. It was, and is, a diverse estate, comprising young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children&#146;s homes&#151;three different types of accommodation catering for differing age groups and differing levels of vulnerability.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08042114000026"></a>Achieving similar separation for girls was much more difficult. Compared with the number of boys in custody, the number of girls is low. That presented problems if we were to succeed in providing establishments of adequate size in reasonably distributed locations. Anyone who was there will not forget hearing the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, who is not in his place today, speaking to the equivalent amendment in Committee and recalling his horror at finding 15 year-old girls in Holloway prison when he inspected it in 1995 in his role as Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons. The Committee agreed that that was not acceptable. Claiming a small amount of credit for the present Government, I should say that they are to be congratulated in small part on taking the steps necessary to ensure that that does not happen now. That was done by means of a phased programme, first removing all girls under 16 from Prison Service accommodation, then removing all girls under 17 and finally building a series of new special units for 17 year-old girls. Those units have a particular focus on the needs of the young women whom they accommodate and have been favourably reported on by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectors.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08042114000027"></a>The current amendment proposes a single type of establishment for all young people under 18. The Government do not believe that that is either workable or desirable. Just as it was right to separate under-18s from over-18s, it is necessary to keep older teenagers apart from younger ones&#151;indeed, in some ways, the difference between the average 14 year-old and the average 17 year-old is far greater than that between many 17 and 18 year-olds. We do not believe that appropriate separation is possible without a range of types of establishment.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08042114000028"></a>The diversity of the under-18s estate is a strength and not a weakness. That is not to say that the present arrangements are the last word; clearly there is scope for continued development in the field. For example, ministerial colleagues and I have referred to the work that is being done at Wetherby to build a new special

I would simply ask that everyone concerned with this issue&#151;and I know that the House is very taken with it&#151;recognises not only the scope for further improvement but to some extent what has already been achieved. We have commented a lot on making sure that custody really is a last resort for young people of this age and we have shown our commitment to providing the courts with effective community interventions that offer an alternative to custody.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08042114000029"></a>I am advised that it is arguable&#151;no more than that&#151;that, because of a drafting error, the new clause that is this amendment would not achieve its intended effect of removing the Secretary of State&#146;s power to specify by order additional types of custodial establishment in which a detention and training order could be served, a power that, if it still remained, could be used to reinstate young offender institutions and secure training centres. I mention that because it would be wrong of me not to say that I had received that advice. Because of the general arguments that I have employed this afternoon, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

However, we think that there is a basic principle involved and that the provision put forward by the Government is not sufficient. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken on the amendment. I particularly recall the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, referring to our position in the league of shame in Europe. It is important that we should mark our disquiet and our feeling that what is happening at the moment is unacceptable, whether it relates to young offender institutions or secure training centres. No doubt those institutions contain people who are concerned and who work hard to achieve results with young people, but one of the problems is that, as those staff are within the Prison Service, they look for promotion upwards into the adult Prison Service. Some of the specialisation and talents that they develop within the YOIs and STCs are lost. For those reasons, we feel that it is necessary to test the opinion of the House on the issue.</p>

Subsequently the noble and learned Baroness has also written to me explaining why that was not possible. I believe that she has copied this letter to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08042114000038"></a>The first issue is the question of limiting the powers of these non-qualified CPS employees to summary offences which do not carry a term of imprisonment. Our view is that this should be firmly on the face of the Bill. The noble and learned Baroness says that this is not necessary; that if the scheme worked satisfactorily, it would in effect petrify the Government&#146;s opportunity to elide summary offences which did indeed carry a term of imprisonment. She believes&#151;and this is no disrespect to her rigorous analysis of any situation before she makes a decision&#151;that if the CPS makes the proposal that now is the time, the fact that she would have to give her imprimatur, or that her successor would have to give the imprimatur, would be enough.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08042114000039"></a>Had that undertaking been given to me 10 years ago, I might have been more sanguine about the scheme. However, I recall that the Government proposed in the Access to Justice Act 1999 that qualified CPS lawyers should be able to become advocates in the Crown Court. I recall the then Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, saying that there was no need to worry because CPS lawyers would be advocates only in circumstances where there was a shortage of members of the Bar, and that these would be only very minor cases.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08042114000040"></a>What do we see today? We see the CPS advertising for experienced advocates to carry cases through from their initiation right to the moment when they make speeches to the jury. I have read recently the director of the CPS saying that in some parts of the United Kingdom he would expect, over a period of time,  25 per cent of criminal cases to be prosecuted in the Crown Court by CPS employees. This was never intended to be under the Access to Justice Act. I know that the noble and learned Baroness always strives to meet her undertakings; but with the best will in the world, I simply do not believe in an undertaking of the sort that she suggests.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08042114000041"></a>This limitation must be in the Bill. If in five years&#146; time the scheme works so well that we are convinced that we can move on, then there will be plenty of opportunities to change matters in a future criminal justice Bill. After all, I shall be amazed if there is not one such Bill every year for the next five years and probably for the next 10 years. I do not think it depends on which Government are in power. Just as night follows day, I think it is close to being that predictable. So that is the first issue.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08042114000042"></a>Secondly, if we are going to extend this right to non-qualified CPS workers, should they be regulated, as are all qualified lawyers, under the Legal Services Act, and in particular, should they be regulated by an approved regulator? The noble and learned Baroness, when we had our meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, explained how she was developing a scheme with ILEX&#151;the organisation which looks after legal executives&#151;so that non-qualified CPS employees should be able to sign up to the principles of ILEX. I do not think that the negotiations are yet complete, but the idea is that they would slot into the Legal Services Act at that point. I came away from the meeting with the impression&#151;I cannot speak for the noble Lord, Lord Thomas&#151;that once that deal was done with ILEX, the CPS employees themselves would then be regulated by the approved ILEX regulator.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08042114000043"></a>It turns out from the noble and learned Baroness&#146;s letter that that is not so. She reminded us that this class of employee&#146;s rights of audience at the court are granted under Section 77A of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, and she went on to remind me that, as such, they are specifically excluded from the Legal Services Act 2007 by virtue of paragraph 1(3)(b) of Schedule 3.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08042114000044"></a>I simply do not regard this as satisfactory. If this class of CPS employee is effectively to perform to the same standards as ILEX, why on earth should they not be regulated by the same person who regulates  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>members of ILEX? It does not make sense to go through the whole paraphernalia of getting them signed up and then exclude the most important responsibility that ILEX has, which is to ensure that its own members live up to what they have signed up to. Why should these employees be excluded? I make that point a fortiori because it is precisely because these individuals are not legally qualified that they need close monitoring by an independent regulator. Otherwise, the only way in which they are monitored is through their contract with the CPS.</p>

<a name="80421-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08042114000045"></a>I believe that for both those compelling reasons&#151;a limitation to non-imprisonable offences in the Bill, and the requirement that non-qualified CPS employees should be subject to an approved regulator under the Legal Services Act&#151;our amendment should be supported. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the meeting that we had with the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General. She was good enough to write to me on  14 March. I assume that she sent a copy to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. She set out in her letter the way in which designated caseworkers are trained at the present time. That training involves training courses, e-learning&#151;which I take to mean dealing with various questionnaires put on the internet&#151;observation of court procedures and a comprehensive resource pack.</p>

I know nothing about the legislation that goes through this House, of course. That is about it: a five-day foundation course, a certain amount of experience in court watching what goes on for a period of time and a one-day further course.

He will need a law degree, of course; he will have to spend 12 months passing his Bar examinations; and he will have to spend 12 months in pupilage and will not be entitled to appear in court at all for the first six months. During that time he will be under the close supervision of his pupil master. It is only at that point that it is thought that he can appear in the most modest magistrates&#146; court in a contested hearing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08042114000048"></a>Putting the two courses of training side by side, your Lordships can quickly perceive that there is absolutely no comparison. More importantly&#151;this is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;a barrister is subject to regulation. There is a regulatory authority, a very strict code of conduct and a very considerable penalty should he breach that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1305"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>code of conduct in any way. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I was under the impression that if courses were provided by ILEX, they would lead to an ILEX qualification, which I would respect very much, and that ILEX would act as a regulatory body, but that does not appear to be the case. I hope that the noble and learned Baroness will be able to assure us that it is so, but as I understand her letter that is not intended.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08042114000049"></a>A further point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, which I also refer to, is that this is essentially mission creep. In her letter to me the noble and learned Baroness refers to the fact that it may be some years before the CPS seeks to extend the designated case worker remit to summary-only offences where imprisonment is a sentencing option. At the moment the proposal is that a designated case worker should appear only in summary-only offences where prison is not an option. In a few years that will be proposed and no doubt we shall go on from there until, in the end, designated case workers with very limited training will be conducting trials in magistrates&#146; courts to the great detriment, I suggest, of the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08042114000050"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has our support. While we do not object in principle to designated case workers appearing in court, they must have proper training and they must be regulated. There must be a sanction to ensure that they carry out their functions in a way that is compatible with the principles of the way in which advocacy should be carried out in the courts of this country.</p>

I am very grateful to the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for keeping me in the loop with copies of letters written to noble Lords and also for a letter of last week from her to me. I retain some concerns. We are dealing with the administration of justice in a criminal court. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has pointed out the training of a designated case worker, even with the pack, will not be sufficient in some cases. One has to bear in mind that in the magistrates&#146; court now, magistrates are laymen, the defendant may or may not be represented&#151;probably not by a lawyer&#151;the clerk need not necessarily be a lawyer in the criminal courts these days and is quite often a layman and if the prosecutor has no real experience of the law and a point of law is raised, there will be real difficulty. We also need to be sure that the prosecutor has the ability to cope with the unexpected.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08042114000052"></a>Two things put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, are particularly important. One relates to offences that are not subject to imprisonment. Although the purists among us might prefer a lawyer to conduct the case, as a matter of reality, in the old days a warrant officer sometimes did the case so there is a real precedent for that. But that was not the kind of case where someone might go to prison. Without the absolute assurance that those who have had the pack, a few days&#146; training and the experience of going into court will have someone at their elbow to tell them what to do when the unexpected arises means that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1306"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they might find themselves not sufficiently independent and certainly not sufficiently clued up about the unexpected. There will be a danger of a miscarriage of justice as a result of which someone might go to prison, particularly a defendant who is unrepresented as so frequently happens in magistrates&#146; courts. Therefore, I very strongly support the fact that the matter should be up front and that those without legal training should not be able to prosecute where imprisonment is a possibility.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08042114000053"></a>I am also very concerned about the regulation of the designated case worker. I listened with a degree of dismay to what is apparently the present position. Although I, too, respect the ILEX training, I do not believe that its code of conduct begins to be adequate for the importance of the work that it does. The noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General says that it is working towards a code of conduct similar to that of the Bar and the Law Society. I am absolutely delighted to hear that, but I would prefer designated case workers not to be able to undertake the work until they are actually regulated by that code of conduct. Bearing in mind not just the hours but the days and days spent on the Legal Services Act last year, where everyone was regulated up hill and down dale, particularly for the Bar and solicitors, it is ironic that a group who are not legally trained are able to carry out prosecutions which might involve imprisonment on the creep system, about which we have been told, without the matter coming back to your Lordships' House and the other place. It seems to me that such people should not be able to creep into imprisonment cases, admirable though I am sure they are. If the Minister tells us that some of them are legally qualified, that is fine. However, she will also have to tell us that a great many of them would like to be legally qualified but that they have not yet got to that point. It seems to me that until they get to that point, they need regulation as good as barristers and solicitors and that they should not be able to prosecute cases where someone might go to prison. I am very supportive of the amendment.</p>

In this case, I suspect that miscarriages of justice could happen, which would arise because people are not properly trained. By miscarriages of justice I mean that the guilty go free and the innocent go to prison. If somebody is not properly trained or regulated, that is more likely to happen than with a proper barrister. That is always possible, as we know of cases where that has happened and should not have done. I suggest that this will happen exactly if that lower standard of people is allowed to prosecute without any regulation or training. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, read out how much training they have to have; frankly, it is practically less than that for driving a pony in an amateur dressage test.

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08042114000062"></a>I do not quite understand the difficulty, since these people can be authorised to carry out any legal activity.

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08042114000064"></a>One must also remember, although this is not by way of any criticism, that these people who will prosecute will in fact be employees of the prosecuting authority. There will therefore be an inevitable temptation for them to stray a little to try and achieve the result that they have been sent there to achieve. Again, I am not saying that they will be fraudulent, but it is easy to overstep the mark a little&#151;particularly if, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, pointed out, there is probably nobody in court who is able to say &#147;You can&#146;t do that&#148;, because they are not legally qualified to do so. Therefore, it seems essential that anybody entrusted with a prosecution is subject not to professional regulation in the sense that is normally meant but to proper regulation whereby if he strays from the straight and narrow he can either be reprimanded or suspended&#151;or whatever is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08042114000065"></a>I would like some enlightenment from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on the point about not prosecuting in criminal cases. His proposed subsection (1A) says that a person can,</p>
<ul><a name="08042114000089"></a>&#147;only be permitted to carry out any legal activity ... if he has been authorised so to do&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042114000073"></a>Surely, that means that it is open to the regulator to say, &#147;You&#146;re very green; you can only do very minor cases&#148;, or &#147;You have done a lot and are doing it rather well; you can be advanced to a higher level&#148;. It would not enter everybody qualified to do anything of which he is capable under this subsection. If I thought that it would be working that way, I would be less worried about the qualification point.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08042114000066"></a>I take on board what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said about the degree of training, which he contrasted with what a barrister has to do. However, a barrister has to be trained to perform in any part of the law, while these people only have to know the relatively narrow procedure for dealing with magistrates&#146; court criminal cases, and so on. Therefore, their training will obviously not be comparable. I have to confess that what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, read out seemed to stray a little too far in the opposite direction. Again, however, the regulator can surely set how much training there is to be; the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, spoke as though that amount was to be fixed for all time and all types of cases. If it is, that would be bad, but I would have thought one could have different levels of training and degrees of experience for varying case types, and be regulated according to your knowledge and experience.</p>

As a previous magistrate and someone who is surrounded by lawyers in my family, I may be one of those who have been trained almost by default in many of the procedures. Having listened to the debate, I am completely convinced by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and I pay tribute to my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08042116000002"></a>There are crucial things that I would want in a court. A magistrate has a clerk of the court, who is the legal expert on areas of sentencing, for example. However, the issue is not only about that. We need to know that people are being addressed by staff who are thoroughly qualified, able and, above all, independent and regulated. What the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said about training for barristers is crucial. The time taken to experience what happens in a court and so on is vital. The fact that they continue to learn and are independently regulated by ILEX is hugely important. I am thoroughly in favour of the amendment, which I hope will be put to a vote&#151;indeed, all the amendments are crucial.</p>

First, I need to say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that as a fully paid-up member of the profession I do not think that the bar is under threat. In the past 10 years, the CPS has been increasingly successful in attracting senior members of the bar and solicitors to work for it. As a result, the quality of advocacy has been significantly enhanced. I do not think that the noble Lord is suggesting that senior members of the bar who are attracted by employment in the CPS should be debarred from so doing. That form of protectionism is far from his heart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08042116000004"></a>Quality is most important and I agree with all those who have emphasised it. I do not think that the young bar is frightened of competition either. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, says about training. He referred to those DCWs who do not do contested cases. The training for those who do such cases is much greater. I gently say to him that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1310"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one often finds that those who have had 20 or 30 years&#146; experience working in the Courts Service before becoming designated caseworkers know a thing or two more than a 21 year-old young barrister who is doing his or her first cases.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08042116000005"></a>Quality is important and I remind the House that the DCWs about whom we are talking have been around and able to perform this work since 1998. They have gained a great deal of practical experience in the court process and through that experience they are well equipped. Who does this work? The average age of a designated caseworker is between 30 and 49; 68 per cent are women and 32 per cent are male; and 71 per cent are in the age bracket that I have just described. They are seen as a good, sound resource. Many of them participate in obtaining qualifications. Twenty-nine are studying for legal qualifications;  22 are studying for their legal practice certificate; and seven are on the bar vocational course. Between 1998 and 2008, 566 DCWs were trained by the CPS. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, are right that training can be tailored to meet needs.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08042116000006"></a>DCWs will be doing three tiers of work. Some will do summary cases only. Let me give the House the flavour of summary cases. They include common assault, drink-driving, threatening behaviour, harassment, taking without consent, wasting police time, assaulting a police officer, being found in enclosed premises and motor vehicle interference. For non-imprisonable offences, DCWs can go to the dizzy heights of prosecuting speeding, careless driving, no insurance, no driving licence, no MOT, construction and use regulations for motor vehicles, ticket touting, touting for hire services, begging, selling alcohol to a person who is drunk, kerb crawling, soliciting, the offence of dogs worrying livestock&#151;a terribly difficult matter&#151;being drunk in a public place and obstructing the highway. We are not talking about the most serious offences, although I am not suggesting that these offences are unimportant.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08042116000007"></a>We are considering an incremental situation starting with tier 1, so that when someone first becomes able to present cases they will be summary offences only. Tier 2 will be summary offences only and non-imprisonable. A gradual increase is appropriate at this stage. I understand those who say that all the matters dealt with by designated caseworkers should be non-imprisonable. I made it clear the last time we debated this matter that that would be regulated by the director&#146;s instructions. We have an opportunity to regulate what DCWs do. I understand the comment of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, about paying peanuts and getting monkeys, but I assure him that DCWs do not fall within that category. Miscarriages of justice occur when the quality of the advocacy is not good.</p>

Somebody should be regulated and tested to make sure that they can do all the things that the noble and learned Baroness says. That is all one is asking for. In other words, the fact that they can do all these things is one thing, but they should be trained and they should be disciplined if they get it wrong.</p>

They have access to supervision by a trained lawyer all the way through. The new procedure, which noble Lords will be aware of, is that a qualified lawyer will look at each case, will be responsible for the charging decision that is made and will be able to prepare matters in order to decide whether a case is amenable and should be dealt with by a DCW or some other form of representation. The noble Earl&#146;s concerns about management, control, testing, training and ensuring quality are certainly covered by the management structure of the CPS. I remind the House of the National Audit report, which spoke very favourably about the quality of DCWs. I understand the concern that has been expressed, but that concern is not merited.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08042116000010"></a>I would like to answer before the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rushes to his feet. I ask him to give me that courtesy, if he would not mind.</p>

<a name="80421-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08042116000011"></a>In the concerns that have been expressed, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised the issue of the codes within the regulatory framework of the Institute of Legal Executives. As I said, professional integrity is the cornerstone of the current Crown Prosecution Service statement of ethical principles. It is enshrined in the codes of conduct and advocacy of the Institute of Legal Executives. The harmonisation of these codes with those of the institute will ensure that designated caseworkers provide the same ethical safeguards to the court as the other legal professions. It follows, therefore, that compliance with the current and future codes within the regulatory framework of the Institute of Legal Executives takes precedence. Regulation by the institute will be every bit as meaningful and robust for designated caseworkers as it is for barristers and solicitors. I do not envisage any circumstance where a designated caseworker or, indeed, a Crown prosecutor would face criticism from his or her line manager for putting those ethical responsibilities first.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08042116000012"></a>In responding to Amendment No. 82, I believe that it is important to emphasise that the CPS voluntarily sought regulation from the Institute of Legal Executives for its designated caseworkers. There is nothing to be gained by placing such regulation on a statutory footing. As I hope I made clear in my letters, to do so would require a significant amendment to the Legal Services Act 2007. At present, and by virtue of the fact that designated caseworkers are granted their rights of audience through statute, they are currently exempt from regulation under the Legal Services Act. This, I believe, was debated when that matter was going through. To amend the Legal Services Act would be disproportionate and unnecessary, given the public commitment of the CPS to working closely with the Institute of Legal Executives to bring about meaningful regulation. I am very happy that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to that matter in his remarks.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08042116000013"></a>Perhaps the overriding concern is reflected in Amendments Nos. 83 and 84. A designated caseworker may deal with cases where the nature of the offence may leave the defendant liable to a sentence of imprisonment. I have made it clear that the Crown Prosecution Service would internally limit the deployment  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1312"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of designated caseworkers, using the DPP&#146;s statutory powers under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to issue general instructions. I remind the House that those instructions have been in situ for the past 10 years; they have worked extremely well and no one has suggested that they have not properly regulated the way in which designated caseworkers have done their jobs. This would have the same practical effect as limiting the clause. I have also made it clear that there would be the added safeguard of the Attorney-General, who would have to consent to any change. I am happy to repeat those undertakings today.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08042116000014"></a>However, in light of the concerns that have been expressed both on the last occasion and today, I also propose that an independent review be undertaken by Her Majesty&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and that independent advice be provided to the Attorney-General before any decision is made to remove or amend the internal restriction. I hope that this added safeguard will reassure the House on this important point. There would be an independent scrutineer of whether it was appropriate to make a change before any such change took place.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08042116000015"></a>An important general point needs to be taken into account in considering the merits of this clause. The ability of the Crown Prosecution Service to grow and encourage the development of designated caseworkers through the Institute of Legal Executives route is one that we should all commend. We have for many years expressed a desire to make the profession more open to both genders and to people from minorities. We know that women and members of the black and minority ethnic community often find it difficult to go immediately from school to university but work very well once they are in a situation where they can be trained and come forward. We have found that designated caseworkers have been a very rich vein. One designated caseworker is now the chief prosecutor in Devon and Cornwall; she is acknowledged to be of real value.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08042116000016"></a>There is merit for the criminal justice system. Fellows of the institute who attain the advocate certificate have wide-ranging powers. To limit those powers in the clause would be to miss an opportunity to use their talents to prosecute a wider range of summary trials, including those where imprisonment is a sentencing option. I remind the House that it takes five years of additional training before an ILEX member can get an advocate&#146;s certificate, so that they are fully conversant with all those important technical issues.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08042116000017"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, asked about the Magistrates&#146; Association. He is absolutely right: the Magistrates&#146; Association expressed anxiety about the move and was antipathetic to it. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, is also right that it spoke about the unamended version of the first iteration of this clause. I have written to it subsequently. I do not have a letter from it, but I understand that in conversations with the CPS it has indicated that it is happier now with the status. However, it still expressed some concerns about the details. I am afraid that I do not have anything in writing, so I cannot tell noble Lords what particular detail might have caused continuing difficulty. The association is certainly happier. The

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08042116000018"></a>I turn, finally, to where we are now. Amendment No. 84A would remove paragraph (d) of the definition of a preventative civil order.

However, we think it wholly inappropriate for a non-legally qualified CPS employee to deal with a VOO, which is an assessment of whether or not somebody is safe to remain at large in society. It is wrong for somebody who is not legally qualified to deal with a matter which could lead to indefinite incarceration.</p>

The effect of the amendment, as he suggests, would be to remove the general power of designated caseworkers to conduct post-conviction applications or other civil proceedings to obtain preventive orders that do not come within the ambit of paragraphs (a) to (c) of the definition. At present, the only orders to fall within paragraph (d) are the sexual offender prevention orders. However, while sexual offender prevention orders would fall within this paragraph, the only role of the prosecutor is confined to reminding the court that it has the power to make such an order and not to lead any evidence. That is literally what they do: they just remind the court. I do not think that the noble Lord would take issue with somebody being entitled to remind the court of its duty in that regard.</p>

<a name="80421-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08042122000004"></a>In essence, therefore, the primary purpose of paragraph (d) is to ensure that designated caseworkers have rights of audience to conduct proceedings were any new orders to be introduced through future legislation. This would of course be subject to the director&#146;s guidance as to whether the CPS thought it appropriate for them to appear. In reaching such a decision, due regard would have to be paid to ensuring that their powers were no more than those capable of being exercised by a Crown prosecutor. I hasten to add that violent offender orders would not come within the remit of a designated caseworker, as Part 7 of the Bill provides for applications for such orders to be made by the police and not by prosecutors. So that would not be within their purview. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s anxiety on that, and I am happy to assure him that I can ease his troubled heart.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="08042122000046"></a>&#147;An internal survey for the Crown Prosecution Service has found that only half the 400 paralegals who will take on the contested&#151;or &#145;not guilty&#146;&#151;trials felt that they had had enough training. A third said that they were under pressure to do court work that fell beyond their abilities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042122000044"></a>That is described as an &#147;internal survey&#148; for the Crown Prosecution Service. Was there such a survey&#151;was that a correct statement? If so, how does it accord with everything that the noble and learned Baroness has told us about the training of those intended to undertake this work?</p>

However, I can point to issues to which I alluded in Committee&#151;namely the reports from Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate and from the Audit Commission, both of which speak highly of outcomes and the professionalism of those who undertake this work. I can also reiterate the CPS&#146;s commitment to ensuring that designated caseworkers who undertake representation in court have the necessary skills. As noble Lords will know, there are designated caseworkers who do not appear in court. We have, as I said earlier, a number of tiers of designated caseworkers. One of the benefits of the tiers is that those who qualify as designated caseworkers can move through the system obtaining greater training and opportunities, either becoming ILEX members or taking solicitors&#146; or barristers&#146; exams. We therefore have the full spectrum.</p>

All of us agree that DCWs should not do work that could involve an individual going to prison; we absolutely agree on that, and we believe that the provisions we have put forward would cope with that. If the House were to disagree to the amendment and the Bill were to provide that DCWs should have no opportunity to do work that might involve imprisonment, we could have an order-making power, probably an affirmative power, so that the matter could come back in that way. It is unnecessary to use the panoply of primary legislation to deal with an issue which could be dealt with by order. I hesitate to use the phrase used by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, but it really would be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I know how much the House dislikes that.</p>

Should the Government have to come back with primary legislation or can this matter be dealt with more informally? The noble and learned Baroness with typical generosity made a concession in saying that she would introduce a further safeguard of an independent qualified lawyer to look at a proposal by the CPS to make this transition.

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08042122000016"></a>I have no doubt whatever about the quality of DCWs. There are many extremely well-qualified DCWs in the CPS, but the noble and learned Baroness will have heard many of your Lordships express concerns about the adequacy of the training that they are likely to receive. I am particularly exercised by the fact that, although a deal will be struck with ILEX on these matters, which I hope will be satisfactory&#151;I am thinking particularly of the remarks of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, on the issue&#151;it is also important that they are seen to be properly qualified. That is why the intermediation of an approved regulator is so important. I accept that that is prohibited in the 2007 Act because of the provision in Schedule 3; but if these amendments are passed by the House that will be a later proposal and therefore the provision in the 2007 Act will fall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08042116000022"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall be brief. The amendment has been tabled to this Bill and to the Children and Young Persons Bill for very deliberate reasons. It seeks to add a requirement that social workers who are responsible for young people in the community stay as caseworkers with them for any period of custody to which they may be ordered. Currently, under the detention and training order regime, the consistency of supervision maintained throughout is critical at the vital stage when a person leaves custody and returns to the community. Therefore, it must make sense for the person who was previously responsible for the young person in the community to carry on with that responsibility when custody is over.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08042116000023"></a>Many noble Lords may wonder why it is necessary to put the requirement in the Bill because it ought  to be happening already. Tragically, it is not&#151;the  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1320"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment would not be necessary if it were. That is not to say that the practice happens nowhere: there are some very good caseworkers who make it their business to stay with their people when they go to custody. However, it is not a statutory requirement. The Department for Children, Schools and Families says that it will include the requirement in instructions, but, sadly, I do not feel that that is good enough.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08042116000024"></a>The statistics show that the children who are ordered into care are the most vulnerable within the young offender estate. Tragically, their reoffending rate is not helped because there is so little consistency in their treatment after release. They lack the parental support which others have. Therefore, I strongly feel that the requirement should be put into the Bill. It links with so much other legislation now being taken through your Lordships&#146; House&#151;particularly the Children and Young Persons Bill&#151;and therefore I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="08042116000025"></a><a name="80421-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80421-0011.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042116000254"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> My Lords, my name is attached to the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, clearly set out why it is so fundamentally important, so I will cover only a few of the main issues. We know that children in care are overrepresented in the secure estate population. Approximately 40 to 49 per cent of children and young people in custody have been in local authority care, and about 18 per cent are still subject to statutory care orders. This is a particularly vulnerable group of children who are most likely to experience resettlement problems on release.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08042116000026"></a>We on these Benches believe that any child removed from their ordinary care arrangements by the state should be understood to be looked after by the state, both in the spirit of the term and by statute. Even those children who are sent to custody directly from their parental home, without being subject to any current or former care arrangements with the local authority, are, to all intents and purposes, being removed from any effective parental supervision and responsibility. In other words, it should be recognised that they move into the care of the state. The Government will argue that, under current arrangements, the youth offending team will have case responsibility. We would say that the main function of youth offending teams is to prevent reoffending, and that while they are required to take account of the holistic needs of the child, they do not have a primary welfare function. While they were originally established as multi-agency teams, with staff from a number of sectors, over time these links have become extremely tenuous and youth offending teams now often consist of generic youth justice workers. For this reason, we feel that children who are looked after, whatever their status and whether or not they are eligible care-leavers, should continue to have involvement from their own child and family social worker throughout their period in custody. That would be the holistic way to manage them, and it is not currently the case.</p>

That being so, my plea would be that there is no earthly reason why it should not be spelled out in statute. At no time is the need for this support as great as when a young person goes into custody. This is the interface between the two systems&#151;two systems that unfortunately show a massive over-representation in the custodial system of children who have been in care. They are over-represented by something like  15 to 1&#151;I think that is the relevant statistic. Therefore there can be no earthly argument for not spelling this out in a specific way. It does not extend the law; it does not extend the practice; but it clarifies the minds considerably of those who are involved in these responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08042116000029"></a>I very much support this clause. As my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham said, our debates on the Children and Young Persons Act went through it, too. We are dealing with the most vulnerable group of people that you can think of. They have almost certainly suffered from the many problems that we have heard read out during these debates. Having a supportive worker in touch with them could make all the difference to whether they reoffend. I stress one thing&#151;emphasis is laid on the particular worker chosen having the necessary skills, and I do think that that is frightfully important. But as well as that, there should be some degree of choice for the young person concerned. I hope that that will be borne in mind. Above all, they need a mentor who will take them through the more difficult periods of coming out of some form of custody and back into the real world&#151;giving them advice on education, skills training and other things. I very much support this amendment.</p>

Actually, it is a stage before Amendment No. 85&#151;it is a new amendment that comes through the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. The committee has asked me to put this forward, which I am very happy to do. It bears a certain resemblance to my earlier amendment, to make Section 37 of the Children Act 1989 part of the youth justice system. This is intended to amend the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, Section 9, in a similar way. We are back, on both amendments, to the welfare of the child appearing in the youth court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08042116000031"></a>The local authority has an obligation, where a child is looked after or in need, to provide proper proposals for that child and, where appropriate, a care plan. Lying behind Amendment No. 85A is the need for careful communication and working together between the social workers of the home local authority and the YOTs. Often, there is a lack of that working together, and a lack of communication. In too many cases, there appears to be a feeling by home social services departments that, when the child is coming up before

They get asked by the YOTs, from time to time, what proposals they have for the child. All too often, the home local authority says, &#147;We&#146;ll wait to see the outcome of the court proceedings&#148;. That is not good enough, because the YOTs, and the magistrates of the youth court, would find it extremely helpful to know what social services think should happen; and to know the contents of the care plan for the child who is looked after. There should be a genuine working together between the local authority, which has the care of the child, and the YOT that is taking over&#151;but should not be taking over to the exclusion of the home local authority and, of course, the court, which needs all the help that it can get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08042116000032"></a>The excellent White Paper, <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I>, summarises clearly the indisputable evidence of the poor outcomes for children who are in care, particularly the children who get into trouble and end up in the youth court. That admirable document is a reflection of a series of system failures. It is those system failures that this amendment is intended to address. We need to put pressure on local authorities&#151;overworked, understaffed, under-resourced&#151;that all too often say, &#147;That person is now the subject of the YOT and the criminal court. We can sit back and deal with the child who has not yet got there&#148;. It absolutely is not good enough for the local authority to take a back seat.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08042116000033"></a>The Howard League for Penal Reform has taken up a number of serious cases of children who have not been identified by the agencies&#151;children who have slipped through the net. There is a need for effective structures that are at present lacking. The purpose of giving the criminal court power to seek help from the home local authority, which is not here at present, is to give the YOT and the court proper help from the home local authority. It is to plug the gap and provide real pressure&#151;a kick up that which I would not mention in this august Chamber. We do need home local authorities to play a proper part and they are not doing so in too many cases. These are children for whom the local authority is responsible and if, as I sincerely hope, Amendment No. 85 is agreed to by the Government, they would have help from the home local authority at the point where they go before the youth court, and before and after they go into custody. We must remember that these children who offend are children in need, children who have welfare concerns, and they are not getting the help that they need.</p>

I suppose there have been two overriding themes in our debates; first the question of the number of young people in custody and the support given to them and, secondly, the important question of the inter-relationship between the criminal justice system and local authorities.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08042116000035"></a>Noble Lords are absolutely right to bring us back to this point, because clearly if we are to have an effective criminal justice system and if we are to  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1323"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve the outcomes that we wish to achieve in the prevention of offending and reoffending&#151;to come back to our previous debates on this&#151;it is absolutely critical that there is a strong partnership relationship between local government and the criminal justice system, particularly the YOTs. That point is very well made indeed. I certainly accept the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that we have to secure consistency of approach. I very much agree with that and with the intention behind much of this amendment, which is to ensure that local authorities provide the right kind of support to children and young people in custody who they have looked after or who remain in their care. There are many aspects of the intention behind this amendment that the Government support. As noble Lords will be aware, the amendment duplicates much of the effect of Clause 16 of the Children and Young Persons Bill, which was recently debated in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08042116000036"></a>The policy intent underlying the provision in the Children and Young Persons Bill in relation to children in custody is to make sure that services for that very vulnerable group of children are effectively co-ordinated, so that they have the necessary support to re-establish themselves in their home area. For some young people, this support will mean being provided with accommodation, foster care or a children&#146;s home, for example, and this would mean that they would again become &#147;looked after&#148; in the formal sense.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08042116000037"></a>The Children and Young Persons Bill will ensure that there is a statutory framework in place so that local authorities maintain contact with children who they have looked after and who are involved with youth justice services. The purpose of that contact will be to maintain continuity with the child and to assess what support the child may need on release, including whether they should again be provided with accommodation by the local authority.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08042116000038"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, implied, following the response of my noble friend Lord Adonis in the debate on the Children and Young Persons Bill, we will use the powers in that Bill to require the local authority to visit children who were provided with voluntary accommodation by the authority who are no longer looked after as their status is dependent on provision of accommodation. That will ensure that all the children within the scope of proposed new subsection (1)(b) of the amendment will receive visits. As my noble friend Lord Adonis has made clear, the intention is that these visits will ensure the continued involvement of local authority children&#146;s services by maintaining regular contact between the child and the local authority.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08042116000039"></a>We are not at present able to make firm commitments as to the detailed content of the regulations and guidance about how the visiting duty towards looked-after children in custody will be discharged. We will, however, ensure that the arrangements for local authority representatives are compatible with the sentence planning, case conference and resettlement meetings while the child is in custody. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that I very much warmed to her use of the word &#147;mentor&#148; in that regard. We have made it clear that as  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1324"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far as possible&#151;one has to understand the practical challenges involved here&#151;we would expect the local authority representative undertaking these visits to be a professional who is known to the child. We do not think that this function should be carried out be a member of a youth offending team, and we will make that clear in statutory guidance.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08042116000040"></a>The visiting role should, overall, mean that local authority representatives ensure that the child is properly safeguarded, that their welfare promoted, that staff in youth justice services have the relevant information about the child&#146;s past experiences and that children&#146;s services are fully participating in planning for supporting the child in the community on release. In developing the new regulations and the guidance we will consult widely, which will involve the Youth Justice Board, Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service, voluntary sector organisations and local government, so that the input from children&#146;s services complements and adds value to the support already provided by the youth justice system.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08042116000041"></a>I appreciate that this issue has been raised in debates and that my noble friend Lord Adonis has corresponded with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with more detail about how we intend to ensure that children who are or who have been looked after in custody receive better support. I reiterate that the Government share similar concerns to the noble Lord and other noble Lords, and that we are taking action on that basis.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08042116000042"></a>Amendment No. 85A was spoken to by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. I congratulate her on the ingenuity of her drafting, since she has used the points that I made against her when we debated this in Committee. The amendment would extend the existing power to direct an investigation to require a local authority to include in its report to the court plans or proposals for working with the child or, if it had no such plans or proposals, why it made that decision. In addition, the amendment would require the local authority, where the child is looked after, to provide the court with a copy of the full care plan, as she so eloquently described in her speech, including additional steps to take if the child were to be convicted of the offence.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08042116000043"></a>I remain of the belief that there is little need for this power in view of the responsibility under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for youth offending teams to provide reports to the court on young offenders. The youth offending team is attached to the local authority, and its multi-agency status should mean that it is best placed to draw together all the relevant information when compiling a report on a young offender. That is probably why the courts do not use the Section 9 power to order a local authority to undertake an investigation of the young offender.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08042116000044"></a>I say to the noble and learned Baroness and to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, that I understand their points about what they described as local authority disengagement. I understand their concerns, and I accept that more needs to be done to ensure that youth justice bodies and children&#146;s services work together more closely, but it is not a matter of legislative provision; it is a matter of practice. The question is how we ensure that we get better practice. I do not  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1325"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>think there is any doubt about that. We are looking at the youth crime action plan, where we are looking at the relationship between youth offending teams and children&#146;s services, which will inform the further development of plans for the youth justice system. I hope that will pick up many of the points that noble Lords have raised today.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08042116000045"></a>Since this debate very much turns on the performance of local government and its inter-relationship with the criminal justice system, I add that we think that the Children and Young Persons Bill is addressing a gap in the statutory provisions. The joint sponsorship of youth justice by my department and that of my noble friend Lord Adonis is a very strong step in the right direction in ensuring a much more complementary and integrated approach, and getting that right at national level has an influence on how YOTs and local authorities should work together in the future.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08042116000046"></a>I have already mentioned in our previous debates the impact of the YOTs inspection regime. As noble Lords will recall, that is a regular inspection, which identifies successes and weaknesses in the performance of YOTs. That enables us to pinpoint areas where performance needs to be improved. I mentioned again the youth crime action plan which will be informed by our debates.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08042116000047"></a>Finally, I shall mention the local authority performance framework in general. While I would not wish to bore the House with a detailed exposition of our new approach to performance management within local government, given the critical importance of youth justice in helping local authorities meet some of the pressures that they face, I am sure that focusing on a smaller number of statutory targets will help to ensure the consistency we all want to see.</p>

<a name="80421-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08042116000048"></a>I do not accept that changes in statute are required. What is required is an improvement in performance and consistency. I hope that I have enabled noble Lords to be satisfied that the Government are far from complacent in this area. We are committed to doing all we can to improve performance and to ensure that there is an integrated approach between YOTs and local authorities so that these very vulnerable young people get the right kind of support.</p>

I listened in particular to the last mention he made of the importance of the YOT inspection regime because that is crucial if there is to be any reassurance about oversight and improvement in performance. I have been greatly reassured by correspondence with the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in which he stated that it is intended that the instructions should be in the guidance. However, the oversight has always concerned me. Up until now, the oversight that should have been there has not achieved its aim. I hope that the guidance will include direction to YOT inspection teams that they should check to see that every young person in care has a case worker with him. If there was full assurance that that was the case, the performance would be overseen.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08042122000022"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are committed to securing the United Kingdom&#146;s borders, improving immigration control and reducing identity abuses as part of our wider national identity scheme. We introduced the biometric registration powers in the UK Borders Act to allow the Secretary of State to issue, in time, secure and reliable biometric documents to all foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control. By recording a person&#146;s fingerprints, we can fix them to a single identity and make it possible to check their identity against centrally held records. This will help to strengthen our border security and to combat illegal migration and identity abuses. These powers will also be the way in which we comply with a forthcoming European regulation that will require the UK to issue a biometric card whenever it grants a foreign national leave to remain.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1328"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08042122000023"></a>We will roll out the identity cards from the end of November 2008. The cards will confirm the holder&#146;s immigration status and entitlements to work and to access public funds in the UK. The regulations are the first set of regulations to be made under the biometric registration powers in the UK Borders Act, and are designed to enable us to operate a pilot to test the biometric enrolment technology and processes. We will test some of the processes and technology by enrolling the fingerprints and photographs of around 10,000 foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control. Under this pilot, the biometric immigration document, which is the technical name for the document issued under the Act, will be issued to those granted leave to remain in the form of a vignette sticker attached inside their passports. This is the same as the one that is currently issued because the pilot is about testing limited biometric enrolment processes and not about testing the actual identity card.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08042122000024"></a>I will set out what the regulations are designed to achieve. The first five regulations concern the name of the regulation, the date of the pilot, definitions and the categories of those who are required to apply for a biometric immigration document. The regulations will affect those foreign nationals applying for leave to remain as types of student, spouses, civil partners or unmarried partners under the immigration rules. They will be required to apply for the document, as will their dependants, when making an application in person at the public inquiry office in Croydon, or, if applying by post, if they reside in one of the London postcode areas listed in the schedule to the regulations. It is also provided that the application for leave to remain is made within the period of the pilot.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08042122000025"></a>The next set of regulations, Regulations 6 to 9, concern the collection of biometric information. Regulation 6 enables an authorised person to require a person applying for a biometric immigration document to provide a record of their fingerprints and a photograph of their face. Where the Secretary of State already has a person&#146;s biometric information, Regulation 7 allows her to use or retain the biometric information she already has in her possession, rather than requiring the person to come in for a second time to enrol their biometric information where this is unnecessary. Regulation 8 provides safeguards for registering the biometric information of children under 16. In essence, biometrics can be taken from a child under 16 only if a parent, guardian or other adult who takes responsibility for the child is physically present. The processes by which the biometric information may be recorded are set out in Regulation 9. This regulation permits an authorised person to require the person to make and attend an appointment within a specified timeframe and place and to specify any documents that they must bring to the appointment, or action which they must take, to establish their identity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08042122000026"></a>Regulations 10 to 13 are concerned with the use, retention and destruction of biometric information held by the Secretary of State. Regulation 10 sets out the various purposes for which the Secretary of State can use biometric information collected under these regulations. They reflect the purposes contained in Section 8 of the UK Borders Act 2007, but with two additions. Regulations 11 to 13 set out when and how

They are similar to the safeguards in the existing biometrics legislation.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08042122000027"></a>Provisions about the issue of biometric immigration documents are set out in Regulation 14. The Secretary of State may issue a document to a person to whom she has decided to grant leave to remain. This regulation also provides that the document has effect from the date of issue, and that it ceases to have effect on the date that the person&#146;s leave to remain ends. Regulation 15 provides for the contents of the biometric immigration document, which for the purposes of this limited pilot is the same as the current vignette sticker attached inside a passport. The Secretary of State may cancel or require the surrender of a biometric immigration document that she has issued. These powers are set out in Regulations 16 and 17.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08042122000028"></a>In circumstances where a person is required to apply for a biometric immigration document and fails to comply, Regulation 18 will enable the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a biometric immigration document, to disregard the person&#146;s application for leave to remain and to refuse the person&#146;s application for leave to remain. This could be, for example, where the person refuses to give his biometrics when required to do so.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08042122000029"></a>Once a person has complied with a biometric registration requirement his or her application will continue to be considered in line with normal immigration processes. Postal customers will be informed of their immigration decisions by post and those who have successfully applied for a premium same day service will continue to receive a decision on the day of their appointment.</p>

We will find out in due course whether they will be just for foreign nationals or for everyone in this country. We were of the impression that the enthusiasm for ID cards in general had worn thin, but clearly that is not so in terms of the UK Borders Act and where that came from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08042122000033"></a>Before going into the details, I want to ask the Minister about the state of preparedness of any IT system which is to hold this biometric information and the details of everyone recorded on it. The Government do not have a happy record on IT systems. Is this a new system or is it already up and  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1330"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>running? Is it on the back of the passport system, which was initially such a disaster and caused much confusion a couple of years ago? Broadly, where are we with the IT system? Is it capable, ultimately, of being expanded to take on all those who are to be included as time goes on?</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08042122000034"></a>It appears that the pilot will effectively last from  28 April to 25 July, with applications from dependents being received only between 16 June to 25 July. Perhaps the Minister can explain this convoluted timetable. I understood him to say&#151;but it is nowhere in the regulations&#151;that these biometric cards will be available or will be used from the end of November. I do not understand the timescale that starts in April. Nor do I quite understand the reason for the original applicant having to make the application so far in advance of his dependents. I should think that one would want it all done together. Presumably, one knows the situation as regards each applicant at the same time.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08042122000035"></a>Regulation 5 specifically refers, as do others, to a person under the age of 18 who makes an application. I presume that this means someone between the age of 16 and 18. But if so, that is not clear. It needs to be clear in the regulations, because a student could be under 16 years old. Will that be all right? The Minister says that the pilot effectively applies to anyone living in London. No other postcodes are listed. What will be the process whereby an applicant will provide his face and his fingers for photographing and printing when they are making a written application? It seems unlikely that such features will already be recorded and kept. How will they be taken if the application is made by post? Will it mean that whoever makes the application will have to go to a centre to have their biometric details taken? The only place mentioned in the regulations is Croydon. I hope that it is not the Government&#146;s intention that all 10,000 applicants should wander out to Croydon to have this matter sorted out.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08042122000036"></a>This is a three-month trial. What will happen to the information obtained during that trial? I think that the Minister said that the documents will be valid until and unless the person was removed or sent away from this country. Will the Minister confirm that? How likely is it that those who need to make such applications will try to stay outside these time limits to avoid having to supply their photographs and prints? The anticipation is that there will 10,000 applications, but if people know that this is a pilot and that they can delay their application, the chances are that they may try to do so.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08042122000037"></a>Is there a timetable for a further rollout? What group is it anticipated will be next? We have the various tiers under the new immigration rules. Will it start at tier 4, for example, or will there be a differential on how these applications are made? I anticipate that this will be the first of many such regulations, so it would be helpful to know the order. </p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08042122000038"></a>I cannot say that I am content with the regulations. I do not think that any of us is clear that this biometric information will make us much safer and secure, but the regulations are there and we must cope with them as best we can.</p>

We on these Benches are concerned about the new immigration regulations, which restrict so many people from outside the EU, particularly those from African states who need to be trained here to learn skills to take back to their native lands. Because of the qualifications required, these people now will not be allowed into the UK. We must look again at that.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08042122000040"></a>There are expected to be 10,000 applications in the first three months of this pilot scheme. We had pilot schemes in three areas for asylum and immigration applicants under that Act. If I remember rightly, there were pilots in east London, Greater Manchester and the East Midlands, and they were withdrawn. Pilot areas can be looked at and one can say, &#147;Gosh, this is not working, so we will withdraw the scheme&#148;. But this pilot is merely the thin end of the wedge. As this is to be applied throughout the UK, it is not a pilot; it is just the first stage. It is also the first stage of the implementation of identity cards, which the Liberal Democrats have opposed from the start.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08042122000041"></a>We know exactly what is happening here. The Government have created 69 passport personal interview offices for the 600,000 people a year who apply for a passport for the first time to undergo a personal interview. We are told that 73,000 interviews have been held so far&#151;no doubt the Minister will put me right if I have given the wrong figure&#151;and not one applicant has been refused. So I would ask whether this is really fulfilling the need that was originally envisaged. The 69 personal interview offices took a long time to open, but in some 30 areas there is a remote facility. A council office or other building is taken over and the interview is conducted with a video link. Is this the beginning of setting up a framework for identity cards as well as passports? If so, how will you take someone&#146;s fingerprints or iris scan by video? The time will come when we have to say, &#147;Gosh, this isn&#146;t working&#148;. The noble Baroness asked about people who apply by post. How will their fingerprints be recorded? We can see many problems here. I do not see how biometrics can possibly stop illegal working because foreign nationals and later on everybody with ID cards will be here legally. People holding passports or identity cards can be admitted legally, so how will that help in the battle against terrorism or against those coming to the UK without good intentions?</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08042122000042"></a>I do not want to take too much time, but I want to ask about the initial cost of this scheme. About six months ago I asked about the cost of the 69 passport personal interview offices. The answer from the Home Office was that they would cost &#163;69 million to set up, or &#163;1 million per office. It is a very costly scheme. So I ask the Minister how much this particular scheme is going to cost and, as has already been mentioned, how

Will a disk get lost somewhere? Will there be sufficient security to ensure that people&#146;s information remains totally confidential? I would be grateful if the Minister could respond to these questions.</p>

As is often the case with dinner time debates, a small number of noble Lords are present. However, the points raised are pertinent and I thank both noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, suggested that perhaps we are not that keen on ID cards any more. I have to say that I do not agree. There is still a very good case for ID cards. While I would not introduce them solely on the basis of counterterrorism, even though people say that they are useful in that context, there are much broader reasons for them. I still believe that on balance it is a good thing to take this route.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08042129000002"></a>As regards the preparedness of the IT system, I can tell the noble Baroness that the system will be based on one that is already in place. It will not be based on the passport system and the noble Baroness was right to say that there were some problems with it initially. This type of system is already being used overseas in biometric visa processes. I believe that we have taken 1.6 million of these since 2002, so we are fairly content with the IT system and believe that it will work under pressure.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08042129000003"></a>I have to agree with the noble Baroness that the timing seems to be rather confusing. Basically, we start the pilot on 28 April for single people aged 18 and over without dependants. On 25 June, we allow those with dependants to become involved in the pilot. The postal element will be complete by 25 July. However, people will continue to go to Croydon to go through the process right up until the full introduction of cards. At that point we will move into the production of cards. It is quite confusing, but that is the breakdown.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08042129000004"></a>On the age of applicants, this applies to all applicants under the age of 18 who need to apply for leave to remain and therefore to all children. The point about the age of 16 applies only, I believe, when applicants have to be accompanied to have their fingerprints taken.</p>

<a name="80421-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08042129000005"></a>The trial will test the processes and the technology. On how written applications are to be made, those who write in will have to attend a biometric event in Croydon at some stage. Initially this is for those in the London postal areas. That is the position as I understand it, but if I am wrong I will write to the noble Baroness. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, there are a number of centres around the UK and the processes and technologies being introduced in Croydon will in future be available in all those centres. People will then be able to attend the centre closest to where they are located.</p>

I want to put one important point to the Minister. A few weeks ago, I entered the United States and was duly fingerprinted. To my surprise, the official told me that my fingerprints were not the same as they were the last time I came in. I was then interrogated while an enormous queue of people with queries formed. What is the probability of having the wrong fingerprints in an immigration investigation?</p>

It sounds as if there was a problem in how the noble Lord&#146;s fingerprints were checked off against his name. I do not know the details, of course, but fingerprints are unique and I have no doubt whatsoever that applying biometrics means that you have a unique record that goes with the name of a person. That, I believe, is extremely valuable.</p>

The fact that we have biometrics tied to a name is extremely valuable in a whole raft of areas to ensure that we have the right people&#151;people who are entitled to be here, who are not making other claims or claiming benefits to which they are not entitled. I am sure that that is extremely valuable. The noble Lord&#146;s point is absolutely valid and I am sure that all noble Lords would agree that we must have a system that does not make such errors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08042129000013"></a>The noble Baroness asked what will happen if people avoid the process and delay an application. We will be monitoring that to check for displacement. One of the points of the pilot is to see what impact that will have and how we might account for it in the future. That is a very good point. In the course of this, we hope that we will resolve how the problem  affects us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08042129000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked about the problem of excluding students who come to this country. I can assure him that the Government see that as a very important issue. The numbers of people coming here are of great value to the global economy, as they are for our country. This is not to try to squeeze that and stop it; it is to ensure that we have only those people who are eligible to attend&#151;those people whom we really want here&#151;that people are not making multiple claims for benefits and that people are not trying to get other people in. The process would clarify those things; it is absolutely not to try to reduce the number of people who come here to our very good training and education institutions to do their various courses. We certainly are not trying to do that.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08042129000015"></a>I am not aware of the number of personal interviews for passports. The noble Lord mentioned the figure of 73,000. Perhaps I may come back to him in writing on that as I am not clear on the exact figure. I would argue that the reason none has been refused is that, if you are a dodgy applicant, you would be wary of going along to an interview because you would be put through a process of being interviewed. It would be a stupid thing to do because you would be bowled out and you would be in a difficult position. That has been the impact. I would say that the process cuts out what I would call the dodgy applicants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08042129000016"></a>I have already touched on the offices and technology. This is the start of building up an office network. The applicants have to attend in person. Special arrangements can, if necessary, be made on a case-by-case basis to get people somewhere that might be more suitable to them. I do not have to hand the number of offices that there will be. Again, perhaps I can come back on that, but various centres around the UK will have all this technology. We are trying it at Croydon because the technology is currently there, we have people who are experts in it and we will be able to check this through on the pilot study. That will then transfer to the other places in November when we start issuing the documentation.</p>

One rule will govern everyone. That is why I mentioned doing this case by case and getting people to a place where they will have their fingerprinting done. The aim is to have a single type of procedure that applies over the whole country to ensure that we have these biometric data.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08042129000019"></a>The Box has corrected me on an issue that I got slightly wrong. Everyone will have to come in to check their fingerprints again, even if we have seen them before, as we need to reverify. I said that, if we had their fingerprints, we would be able to work on that, but they will have to come in and have them rechecked and reverified to ensure that identities have not been swapped, as was mentioned earlier.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08042129000020"></a>The last assessment on the cost of the scheme was in November 2007 when, at 2007-08 prices, it was assessed to be &#163;182 million from October 2007 to October 2017. This is being updated in the next ID card cost report, which I think comes out in June. The new figures will say what the cost is. I do not know whether there has been much change in that, but that is the rough figure. People involved in the pilot scheme will not have to pay anything. However, the total costs overall were estimated to be about &#163;182 million for that 10-year period. As I said, the updated cost will come out in June this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08042129000021"></a>As regards the safeguards to protect personal information&#151;this has been raised a number of times in the House&#151;there is no doubt that there have been some terrible slips. However, people are clear about how they should look after data. There are strict guidelines. We have to make absolutely certain that those guidelines are enforced and that people are more aware of them. I am afraid that in this modern day and age there is a need for keeping large amounts of data and centralising them. That enables things to work better and more efficiently and it helps to save costs. One sees it in big firms and corporations, but we all have to get much better at looking after those data, whether they are our own personal data or data on the grand scale.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08042129000022"></a>There is no doubt that there are problems. Some of the personal information will be encrypted to make sure that it cannot be got at. There will be legal safeguards regarding how personal information is stored within the UKBA. There are instructions on how to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and there are issues to do with the Human Rights Act. We have looked very closely at this. Staff are already subject to security vetting. Access to the IT databases, including the UKBA database, is set so that staff have it only when they are required to do so to undertake their work.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08042129000023"></a>We are making sure that all the right mechanisms are in place. I do not want to underestimate how important this is. One has to keep working at it to get it right because it is absolutely crucial. As I say, I am afraid that in this modern world of ours we need to have these data that enable us to bowl out crime and to pick up people who should not be here and criminals. It is interesting to note that the pilot scheme that we ran for the borders measure enabled

We did so by having PNR data, being able to look at them, match them and bowl these things out. I said that the update on the cost would be given in June. I apologise; in fact, an updated cost figure will be given on 8 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08042129000024"></a>In summary, I hope that I have answered most of the questions. If not, I shall come back to noble Lords. This is an integral part of enabling a successful rollout of identity cards for foreign nationals. The pilot scheme is extremely important because we do not want things happening such as occurred at Terminal 5. It is absolutely essential that we do run-throughs and make sure that we get these things right. It is part of our effort to improve the security of our borders and part of our wider national identity scheme. The pilot will help us to improve the technology and the processes involved when requiring foreign nationals to attend biometric registration. It will speed all that up and will assist with the main rollout from November 2008 when we start, as I say, to issue identity cards as the biometric immigration document issued under the UK Borders Act. We are determined to secure the UK borders. Identity cards for foreign nationals are a crucial step in fighting illegal immigration, in enabling those who are here legally to prove their identity, which helps them, and in preventing those who are here illegally from benefiting from all the privileges that they get from living in this wonderful country of ours. As such, I commend these regulations to the House.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08042132000003"></a>Clause 61 [<I>Compensation for miscarriages of justice</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="08042132000004"></a><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08042132000070"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford</b> moved Amendment  No. 86A:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a><a name="08042132000041"></a> Clause 61, page 45, line 3, leave out &#147;2&#148; and insert &#147;6&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80421-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08042132000005"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of my amendments is to highlight the Government&#146;s proposals for limiting compensation to those who have suffered a miscarriage of justice. When the provision in the Bill for Clause 61 was first announced, it was suggested that this would bring it in line with the compensation for the victims of crimes of violence. I declare a remote interest as a former member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board under the original scheme. The ethos of the compensation for the victims of criminal injuries is that the person who causes the injuries generally is in no position to pay any damages.  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1337"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If he is in a position to pay, if the perpetrator can compensate the victim in a civil action, there is absolutely no limit to the amount of damages that he can recover, and he would recover damages in the ordinary way, assessed on the basis of the injuries to himself, the loss of earnings, and so on. But a policy decision was made some time ago, with the support of all parties, that since victims of criminal acts cannot recover compensation in the overwhelming generality of cases, the state should step in and provide a scheme to give them compensation.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08042132000006"></a>As originally envisaged, that scheme was based on common law damages and a person who was the subject of an assault or more serious injury was entitled to recover damages assessed in the ordinary way. In 1992, a decision was taken to take that provision away and to have a statutory scheme which had a tariff attached to it: so much for a finger, so much for a leg, so much for this, that or the other. At that point I resigned from the board because I thought that that was an unfair scheme and a derogation of principle to depart from awarding a person ordinary common law damages. Notwithstanding my resignation, that scheme has continued since that time and over the years it has become subject to a limitation, the upper limit being &#163;500,000.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08042132000007"></a>The victims of miscarriages of justice are in a totally different position. The potential defendant in such a case is not a criminal who has caused injury so the state steps in, as a matter of social welfare, to assist the victim and the state has to carry the responsibility for the miscarriage of justice. In my experience, those miscarriages of justice can come from a variety of situations. They can arise because of perjured evidence by witnesses of fact but more often they are discovered as a result of failings in the forensic service or a failure by the prosecution to disclose things. A variety of issues can arise on appeal which results in a person being acquitted and becoming a recognised victim of a miscarriage of justice. The only body that could carry responsibility for that is the body that has imprisoned him, the body that has been responsible for a system of criminal justice which has broken down. Hence, where there is a compensation scheme for a victim of a miscarriage of justice, the victim recovers from the only body that can be held responsible for his imprisonment.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08042132000008"></a>The Government are now introducing a cap on damages&#151;on compensation&#151;originally to make it equivalent to the compensation for victims of crimes of violence. That simply confuses two separate reasons for the state granting compensation. In some ways, the victim of a miscarriage of justice is in a worse position than someone who has received a physical injury, short of death, because when the person who has been locked up is eventually released by the Court of Appeal, what do they go back to? Generally, he or she is homeless and has lost his or her family; generally, the job has gone. In addition to all of that, during that period of imprisonment they may have suffered enormous psychological damage and, in many cases, psychiatric illness arising out of it.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08042132000009"></a>It is not possible that there should be a limit where one could say, &#147;It has to be under &#163;500,000&#148; when,  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1338"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>over a period of years, just the provision of a home or a job would bring someone swiftly up to that level of money. Accordingly, our amendments would, first, extend the proposed limitation of two years to six for bringing a claim from the date that the miscarriage of justice is discovered, which brings it in line with most civil claims. Secondly, they would remove the cap on compensation&#151;where, admittedly, as your Lordships can see, the Government are prepared to raise the limit to &#163;1 million by their own amendment. However, often that too can be exceeded.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08042132000010"></a>Our third objective is to remove from the Bill the limitation on loss of earnings. Under the Bill, a person who has been imprisoned for many years is entitled only to one-and-a-half times the average national wage by way of compensation for loss of earnings. It does not matter how high-flying he may have been in his profession or occupation, or what sort of opportunities for promotion he has missed, and so on; the claim is to be limited in that way. We submit that that is grossly unfair. We believe that with the scheme for compensating people, as originally envisaged and administered by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who, with all of his skilled expertise in personal injury cases has done a great deal for people who have been the victims of miscarriages of justice, there should be a maintenance of the present position.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08042132000011"></a>Another matter causing concern about compensation is that your Lordships&#146; House decided that the scheme is such that someone must have the cost of board and lodging over their period of imprisonment deducted from their compensation by the state. It is, I respectfully suggest, an insult to have to pay for the period of imprisonment under what is to be recognised as a miscarriage of justice. That is a mean provision. It cannot come from principle, but only from a desire to save money. It comes directly from the Treasury; we oppose it absolutely wholeheartedly, and I hope that your Lordships will agree with what I have said.</p>

By that, I mean that he has great expertise in this field, which goes back many years, and I pay tribute to it.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08042132000013"></a>Amendment No. 86B would remove the proposed &#163;500,000 maximum compensation payment. The proposal in the Bill as it stands is to cap compensation at &#163;500,000 following a miscarriage of justice. This would mean that maximum compensation paid by the state was the same as that paid to victims of crime under the criminal injuries compensation scheme. Of course we accept that the circumstances of victims of miscarriages of justice and victims of crime are different. That is also true of one victim of crime from another victim of crime or one victim of a miscarriage of justice from another victim of a miscarriage of justice. They are broadly analogous in that the impact on victims&#146; lives in terms of the damage and hardship suffered, whether physical, mental or both, can be devastating.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08042132000014"></a>At the moment the difference in the compensation awarded can be stark. A victim of violent crime can  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1339"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>receive a maximum of &#163;500,000 from the Government no matter what the extent of the injuries suffered and a victim of a miscarriage of justice can receive unlimited compensation even in circumstances when they have spent little or no time in custody. The average state compensation paid to a victim of crime under what is generally considered one of the most generous victims&#146; compensation schemes in the world is &#163;5,500. The average paid to a victim of a miscarriage of justice is about &#163;250,000.</p>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="08042132000015"></a><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08042132000072"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, if the noble Lord is going to use that statistic, does he agree that claims on the compensation board amount to hundreds of thousands a year and that claims of victims who have suffered a miscarriage of justice amount to a handful of people&#151;perhaps 30 a year?</p>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="08042132000016"></a><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80421-0013.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08042132000073"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lord, there is certainly a difference and of course I accept that. I understand that the average compensation paid goes a little way towards making the point I tried to make, but as it is an average it does not speak about every case.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08042132000017"></a>It has been argued&#151;it was hinted at tonight&#151;that miscarriages of justice are always the fault of the state. It is for the state to compensate but it is not always the fault of the state, although it is at fault on occasion. Sometimes a complainant makes false allegations and is believed by both the prosecution and the jury. We all know of that having happened. Sometimes new techniques&#151;DNA is the best example&#151;are developed that provide better and clearer evidence. There are cases where no blame at all can be attached to the prosecuting authorities for a conviction that is rightly quashed. In reality, in all cases whether or not the state is to blame, it has to pay the compensation. The same reality means that the state is responsible for compensating victims of crime as the people who commit offences are often what used to be described as men of straw in that they have no financial backing.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08042132000018"></a>Such responsibility is right in a civilised country. There is nothing to stop someone seeking redress through the civil courts following a miscarriage of justice for, say, malicious prosecution, in the same way that a victim of crime can bring civil proceedings against the person who harmed him. I recognise that such a course, particularly an accusation of malicious prosecution, has many difficulties if one is to prove it. That is why we attempted to explain in Committee that the requirements for making an application for compensation under the miscarriage scheme operated by my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor are much less onerous than making a civil claim through the courts, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08042132000019"></a>For those reasons it is appropriate that compensation should be capped, but we acknowledge that some refinement of the &#163;500,000 limit provided for in the Bill would be sensible. Government Amendment No. 86C in this group would increase the maximum payable from the current &#163;500,000 in all circumstances to the same amount where the applicant has spent less than 10 years in relevant detention, and up to &#163;1 million where the applicant  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1340"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has spent 10 years or more in relevant detention. This enables very substantial compensation to be made to applicants, but recognises the principle that compensation should not be unlimited, and that applicants do not have to prove their case in the same way that they would in a civil court.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08042132000020"></a>I accept that the amendment would mean that there is no longer a straight read-across to compensation paid to victims of crime, where the limit is &#163;500,000. It would none the less keep a link for most cases, while recognising that where, as a result of a miscarriage of justice, an applicant has spent as long as 10 years or more in prison, more compensation could be paid. Government Amendment No. 86E would enable both the &#163;500,000 and &#163;1 million limits to be altered by affirmative resolution of both Houses. Government Amendment No. 86F sets out in some detail the types and periods of detention that would be counted when calculating which caps should apply. Government Amendment No. 86G would ensure that the provision inserted by Amendment No. 86F extends to Northern Ireland. Finally, Amendments Nos. 115C, 115D and 115E make similar provision for compensation for miscarriages of justice in the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08042132000021"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 86D in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. This seeks to remove the cap on how much can be paid for lost earnings in any one year when the assessor is making an assessment. The pecuniary loss element of miscarriages of justice compensation awards is intended to compensate for such things as loss of earnings, loss of future earning capacity, loss of opportunity and loss of pension contributions. Its purpose until now has been, as far as it has been possible, to put the applicant back into the financial position that they would have been in but for the miscarriage of justice. Increasingly, applicants have submitted hugely complex and speculative claims. The assessor is left with the difficult task of determining the financial position an applicant would have been in had the miscarriage of justice not occurred, as against the position they thought, or even hoped they might have been in. Consequently, claims can, not unusually, take years&#151;not months&#151;to sort out. On average, it takes three and a half years and, in several cases, over 10 years. Of course, they also cost a very large amount of money. I have evidence of a forensic accountant&#146;s bill for &#163;400,000. I am not saying that it related to a question of compensation for loss of earnings, but it is an example of how large these bills can be and what a long time they take to work out.</p>

<a name="80421-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08042132000022"></a>It is in everyone&#146;s interest for these cases to be finalised as quickly as possible. This will be facilitated by a cap on the amount of compensation that can be awarded for any year&#146;s lost earnings because it is likely that less evidence of loss will be required and will be easier to provide. Indeed, swifter resolutions will, perhaps, help some applicants to draw a line under what, in every case, is an unfortunate experience, to put it mildly, if they have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, and to move on with their lives. The proposed limit is one and a half times the median gross annual earnings as published by the Office for National Statistics. Again, this is in line with what applies under the Criminal Injuries Compensation

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80421-0014.htm"/>


<a name="80421-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08042132000023"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 86A in this group would extend the proposed time limit for making a claim for compensation in relation to a miscarriage of justice from two to six years. Our proposed limit of two years for making an application is the same as that for making an application for criminal injuries compensation. We do not accept that it should be increased to six years, in line with that for bringing many&#151;but, of course, not all&#151;types of civil action. All that is required to make an application for compensation is the completion of a relatively simple form, giving the factual details of the case or, indeed, simply writing a letter setting out the circumstances. There is no equivalent burden of proof to be met or substantial argument to be presented.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08042132000024"></a>In the vast majority of cases, two years from the date of the quashing of the conviction or the date of the retrial should be sufficient time to make such an application. We have of course made provision for an application made after the two-year period to be accepted in exceptional circumstances. Someone being incapacitated for a large part of the two-year period might well be regarded as an exceptional circumstance.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08042132000025"></a>I am sorry that we disagree with the noble Lord on the principle of capping payments for miscarriages of justice. We think, for the reasons I have attempted to state, that we are right about it. I hope that the concession&#151;if that is the right word&#151;that we have made in raising the amount for those who have suffered the longest miscarriages of justice slightly assuages the noble Lord when he hears our arguments. We have moved some way in his direction, and I hope that he feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I will not repeat what I said but, for example, justifying the &#163;500,000 cap proposed in the Bill because that is what victims of criminal injuries get, and the sum that is one and a half times the average wage because that is what they get, indicates how the Government have failed to grasp the essential difference. At some point, this will come back to haunt them. Having been party to a generous scheme of compensation in the sense that people are put back, after they have been released from prison, to the position in which they would otherwise have been, in so far as money can do that, and then abandoned that principle for no other reason than to save money&#151;we have not heard anything on principle from them at all&#151;the Government will be haunted by this for a long time.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08042132000036"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment inserts a new clause which would permit the withdrawal of warrants in a case where a magistrates&#146; court has proceeded in the absence of the accused and imposed a fine which is then enforced by means of a warrant. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has a great interest in this matter. Noble Lords are looking round, but he cannot be here and therefore I am putting forward the amendment with his consent.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08042132000037"></a>Following our discussions in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the Z2K Trust had meetings with the Minister and they made some progress, but two major points are outstanding: first, while defaulters or their representatives can ask for the cases to be reheard by the magistrates&#146; court, the Government have said nothing about the fines officer or the bailiff referring back to the courts the case of vulnerable people who have been fined disproportionately in their absence. Noble Lords may remember that in Committee we made the point that if a person does not know that he has been summoned to court and does not know that a fine has been imposed it may be that the first he knows of these proceedings is when the bailiff knocks on the door. The purpose of the provisions in the amendment is that at that point the bailiff should be able to consider the position of the people with whom he is dealing, not simply to exercise his powers but to take a decision as to whether in all fairness and justice this matter will be referred back to the magistrates&#146; court.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08042132000038"></a>Secondly, many of your Lordships who have experience as magistrates know that in imposing a fine it is necessary to have regards to the means of the offender. The court in the absence of the defendant and without any notification to him may be unaware of the financial circumstances of the person concerned. Fines officers and bailiffs need to be under a positive duty to report back to the magistrates&#146; court cases of vulnerability or disproportionate fines in relation to means for the magistrates to reconsider. That is not terribly difficult. Generally speaking, bailiffs do not exercise their powers immediately but take time; they warn the person concerned and then go back. In the period before finally enforcing the order the bailiff has ample time to consider the person concerned and whether the case should be reported back.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08042132000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, tells me that he found the expectations far too high in the Ministry of Justice about the capacity and knowledge of the relevant procedures among vulnerable people. For  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1345"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and Mr Paul Nicholson of the trust pointed out to me, 7 million adults in the United Kingdom have a reading age of 11. For such issues there is no legal aid. Many people subject to such procedures are functionally handicapped when it comes to using legal processes. They are incapable of understanding the appeal and complaints system and will be unable to apply for a rehearing or to bring a complaint unless assisted by lawyers or specialist advisers. It is always open to a bailiff to discourage the person to whom he is speaking to take the matter further. Bailiffs are concerned with their commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08042132000040"></a>The amendments that we have tabled deal with those problems. I invite your Lordships&#146; attention to them. I have already referred to subsection (1), where the financial penalty may be suspended or withdrawn. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08042136000001"></a>Subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State should make regulations that will enable a bailiff to suspend or withdraw the warrant and return the matter to the court. Subsection (3) provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a><a name="08042136000031"></a>&#147;Regulations ... shall specify the steps to be taken in a case where following conviction it is discovered that the offender is a vulnerable person&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08042136000003"></a>We have to have a system for the enforcement of fines which is humane and just. I beg to move the amendment in that context.</p>

<a name="08042136000004"></a><a name="80421-0014.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80421-0014.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042136000037"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, of course we accept that vulnerable people may have difficulty in dealing with some issues. However, we cannot accept the new clause&#151;although we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for raising this matter again&#151;because powers are already available to ensure that warrants outstanding against vulnerable people may be referred back to the courts. These powers are already used. That is not to say that we ought to have a system that simply allows a person routinely to stop a process after they have committed an offence, ignored a summons, failed to appear at court, or failed to respond to repeated correspondence from the court; but even at the latest possible stage, when a bailiff is engaged, there is and ought to be a process whereby the matter can be halted in the case of a vulnerable person.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08042136000005"></a>The new clause provides that where an offender has been convicted in absence and fined, a warrant to enforce the fine or other financial penalty may be suspended or withdrawn. Regulations may provide that those who may suspend or withdraw the warrant may include a court, a member of Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, or any person employed in enforcing the warrant. The regulations under the new clause would also have to set out the steps to be taken when a person is deemed vulnerable. Finally, the new clause attempts to define a vulnerable person for the purposes of this power.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08042136000006"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, told the House, following the withdrawal of this amendment in Committee on 3 March my noble friend Lord Hunt and I had a useful meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I believed that we reached agreement on the extent of the current powers to deal with the withdrawal of distress warrants. That meeting was also attended by representatives of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, which does such valuable work in assisting vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08042136000007"></a>At that meeting, my noble friend gave an undertaking that our officials will develop guidance for the courts which will clarify their powers to withdraw such a warrant. He also agreed that officials will consult with the trust as well as with other key stakeholders, such as, of course, the Magistrates&#146; Association and the Justices&#146; Clerks&#146; Society. My noble friend followed up that meeting with a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. The Reverend Paul Nicolson of the trust kindly copied my officials into a response to my noble friend&#146;s letter, indicating that he thought some points had not been answered. These are the ones that the noble Lord has quite properly raised tonight. The first concerns the fines officer.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08042136000008"></a>Let me deal with the referral back to court by a fines officer or bailiff. I remind the House that under Schedule 5 to the Courts Act 2003 the fines officer has the power to refer a case back before the magistrates&#146; court at any time. For example, the fines officer could do this if they did not have at their disposal suitable delegated powers to deal effectively with the offender. In practice, this power enables a fines officer to return a case to court where it is clear to them that the offender is vulnerable and genuinely unable to pay the fine. The magistrates could consider the powers which they have at their disposal, which include the power to remit or reduce the level of the fine as they feel appropriate.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08042136000009"></a>Bailiffs, too, should refer the matter to court if they come across someone who they consider genuinely vulnerable. There is concern that the National Standards for Enforcement Agents&#151;which is only guidance for bailiffs&#151;is being widely ignored in practice. However, the bailiffs have a contract with Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service and are required by that contract not to take enforcement actions in certain situations. The relevant paragraph is 6.31 of the specification for private enforcement provision. I quote briefly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_119"></a><a name="08042136000032"></a>&#147;The Contractor shall not take any action to levy distress without prior reference to the court if the Defaulter: is in hospital or nursing home; appears to suffer from severe physical or any mental disability; is an elderly person who has difficulty dealing with his/her affairs; is suffering long-term sickness, serious or acute illness or frailty, which has resulted in a recent period of hospitalisation or defaulter being housebound and can provide evidence of sickness for the period in default&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042136000010"></a>Some noble Lords may say, &#147;Yes, but in practice this means nothing to the vulnerable person with the bailiff knocking at the door&#148;. That is not the case, in our view.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08042136000011"></a>If a person has a complaint about a bailiff, the first thing to do is to complain to the company that the bailiff works for. This is important because the   


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1347"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Courts Service contract with bailiffs was recently extended for a further year, until the end of March 2009. There have been some attempts to make the complaints process in respect of bailiffs more robust. If this does not work, an individual can go to the magistrates&#146; court that issued the enforcement order and, as we explained to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, ask the court to withdraw the distress warrant.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08042136000012"></a>We acknowledge that bailiffs have a difficult job, but we accept that some do not always do that job as we might like. We are fully committed to the regulation of the bailiff industry. I firmly believe that regulation of the industry will drive up standards by improving training and raising professionalism and behavioural standards where necessary. Part of that improvement will come from improving compliance with the national standards where that is needed. Noble Lords will know that primary legislation in 2007 delivered important enforcement law reforms, including provision for an enhanced certification process for bailiffs ahead of full regulation. The House will also remember the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The next step is to develop the underpinning rules and regulations that will bring those reforms into force. A scoping exercise to that end has commenced involving a series of meetings with relevant parties. It is anticipated that this scoping activity will be completed by May of this year.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08042136000013"></a>Lastly, what about the argument&#151;perhaps the noble Lord&#146;s most powerful argument&#151;that some of these people are simply too vulnerable to engage in this process? I stress that those who help to support vulnerable people&#151;and thankfully there are many in our society, both volunteers and relatives, who do&#151;must do all they can to ensure that they do not wait until the bailiff is at the door.</p>

<a name="80421-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08042136000014"></a>The key is to contact the fines officer before matters get to that stage. The fines officer can advise offenders, help them to understand what has been ordered by the court and explain the implications of default. They can advise offenders where they can get help managing their finances, where that is needed. Fines officers can help offenders to understand how they can appeal against the decision of the court, or make a complaint about enforcement action taken either by the court or by bailiffs themselves. It is therefore vital that offenders, especially those who could be considered vulnerable, keep in touch with the court. We cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for offenders to use fines officers as a way of keeping in touch with the court and for help with understanding the enforcement process. If they do so it will reduce the number of occasions when the first face-to-face contact which the offender has with the court is through a bailiff on the doorstep attempting to execute a warrant of distress in lieu of payment of a fine. In the light of what I have said and the work that we are doing on this, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_120"></a><a name="08042136000033"></a> Clause 63, page 47, line 7, leave out &#147;both&#148;</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08042136000021"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, with this amendment we move to Part 6 and the clause concerning extreme pornography. The Minister said that we had a series of Second Reading speeches in Committee. There was a good reason for that, as noble Lords felt that important principles were being explored and did not feel that the Government had got this part right. That is not to say that there is not an issue to be addressed&#151;I accept that there is&#151;but the Government have not yet got it right. This group of amendments attempts to get us nearer to getting it right.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08042136000022"></a>There was clearly some support in Committee for what the Government are trying to do, but we on these Benches, and many other noble Lords on other Benches, parted company with the Government because we felt there were a number of problems which the Government still needed to address. First, the Government have veered far away from the definition in the Obscene Publications Act. One of our wishes is that this part should bring into line what the OPA does for producers of material with an internet age to address the fact that this material can be produced outside the UK.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08042136000023"></a>The sort of definition we would be looking at would be one that has been tried and tested in the courts under the Obscene Publications Act and that does not confuse the question of whether the material is produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal with the question of whether it is obscene. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, reminded us in Committee, juries have great difficulty in dealing with what is likely to deprave and corrupt. Now they will have to contend not only with that question but also with whether the material is produced solely or principally for the purposes of sexual arousal. That has complicated the issue.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08042136000024"></a>In his reply in Committee, the Minister helpfully said that the Government are seeking after consultation with the police and the CPS to make it illegal to possess material that would normally be liable to  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1349"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prosecution under the OPA. We agree that it is important that the OPA is taken as the starting point because there has subsequently been a vast amount of case law which has moved with the times as society&#146;s definition of what is obscene has changed.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08042136000025"></a>The Minister made it clear in his letter of 27 March that what we in the UK have regarded as obscene ever since 1959 is on the whole in advance of what most other countries have regarded as obscene. He sent us a useful round-up of how some of those other countries have legislated. As he says, the UK is a leader. He also says that it would not be the first time the UK has taken a lead in this area. For that reason in particular, it is very important, if these clauses are to be anywhere near to being up that task, that our amendments should be the very least to which the Government aspire. Our amendments reflect the fact that both in Committee and in his letter the Minister accepts that the OPA is good and satisfactory legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08042136000026"></a>The decades of case law that have built up to a consensus on what is a very difficult subject reflect societal changes. We have therefore tabled Amendment No. 86L to clarify further that, in criminalising what an internet porn viewer is looking at, it should be the same sort of thing that it would be illegal to print under the OPA&#151;neither more nor less. </p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08042136000027"></a>Amendment No. 86K would ensure that the Bill criminalises a possessor of material in which something is taking place that is actually criminal and not merely distasteful, however distasteful that might be. Will the Minister say more about the penalties which this part of the Bill carries and which are now very severe? If someone viewed over the internet a third party having sexual intercourse with a sheep, would that carry a greater penalty than someone actually having sexual intercourse with a sheep? It is important to focus on the effects of what we are talking about here. Should watching something that is clearly illegal, that clearly gives rise to animal welfare issues and that has clearly been legislated for in animal welfare legislation be more criminal and carry greater penalties than the actual act itself?</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08042136000028"></a>In Amendment No. 86M, we have sought to give a far clearer definition of what a sexual offence is. Those offences are quite adequately defined in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and surely the Government do not want to confuse an already fraught area by having two parallel interpretations of what a sexual offence is.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08042136000029"></a>I will come back to some of the more fundamental issues when we debate whether these clauses should stand part of the Bill at all, but at this stage, those are the matters that I wish to talk about. Therefore, I beg to move.</p>

Now I have said it, and no one can accuse any political party of having any involvement in that.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08042137000002"></a>Before I went on to any Front Bench, I was involved in the proceedings on the Video Recordings Bill 1983, which became the Video Recordings  Act 1984. Three of us&#151;Douglas Houghton, Hugh Jenkins and I&#151;fought against that Bill all by ourselves and to no real effect. The starting point was that what we do in our homes&#151;the possession of books or images&#151;is no business of the Government or the courts. What we have on our bookshelves is still not their business, but something has encouraged Governments of both persuasions to think that what we may have in terms of video recordings or pornographic images on the internet, or whatever they may be, is the concern of government.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08042137000003"></a>Of course, if any of those images involves the commission of a crime in their production, an existing law deals with that, which none of us can contest. This is not an argument for child pornography, for bestiality, for snuff movies or anything like that. No one is defending that and there is a perfectly good law to deal with it. Having said that, what does it matter to the Government whether what we have in our homes for our own purposes is for sexual arousal or not? What is wrong with sexual arousal anyway? That is not a matter for Parliament or government to be concerned about. I am opposed in principle to interference in the private lives of adults as long as what they do does not cause harm to anyone else, or arises from or causes any offence under criminal law.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08042137000004"></a>I have a further objection, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has eloquently brought out. We have had the Obscene Publications Act 1959 for nearly 50 years. In Committee, my noble friend Lady Kennedy said that, yes, there are problems with interpretation, but the courts during that period have successfully dealt with those problems and the wording of the Obscene Publications Act. This part of Part 5 introduces new definitions of obscene or extreme pornography, which cloud the agreement that generally has been reached in this country about what is obscene and what should be allowed. That is extraordinarily unfortunate. It is damaging to the interpretation of the law; to the confidence of people that the law understands the variety of emotions and feelings that there are about sexual matters; and to the reputation of the law itself.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08042137000005"></a>I have no hesitation in supporting the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in these amendments. I hope that the Government will go a good deal further than they went in Committee in recognising the validity of her arguments.</p>

If the noble Lord can find the appropriate newspaper, he might find that interview amusing to read.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08042137000007"></a>I should like to add to what the noble Lord said, because I am coming at this from a similar angle, even if I do not necessarily arrive at the same conclusion. In Committee, I quoted the famous remark of Mrs Patrick Campbell more than 100 years ago, which I shall now quote properly in full. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_121"></a><a name="08042137000026"></a>&#147;It doesn&#146;t matter what you do in the bedroom as long as you don&#146;t do it in the street and frighten the horses&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042137000021"></a>I think that most, or all, of us would agree with that. Our only problem is the definition of what frightens horses and what goes slightly too far.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08042137000008"></a>At this point, I have to say that I am very grateful to the Minister, with whom I have had some discussions. He offered me the chance to look at a number of these films and no doubt the noble Lord will tell us more about that in due course. In what was possibly a cowardly manner, I did not take him up on his offer, and so I have left it to him to look at the films. However, I have read the Bill, which defines an extreme pornographic image as an image that is,</p>
<ul><a name="08042137000027"></a>&#147;(a) pornographic, and</ul><ul><a name="08042137000028"></a>(b) an extreme image&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042137000022"></a>There follows a definition of the word &#147;pornographic&#148; which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, described as being something that causes sexual arousal. However, the extreme image is defined in subsection (6) as,</p>
<ul><a name="08042137000029"></a>&#147;(a) an act which threatens or appears to threatens a person&#146;s life,</ul><ul><a name="08042137000030"></a>(b) an act which results or appears to result (or be likely to result) in serious injury to a person&#146;s anus, breasts or genitals&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08042137000023"></a>and so it goes on. At this point it becomes slightly difficult. Having offered what I will call the  Mrs Patrick Campbell definition of what we think is the right approach, I then said that I do not know what we define as that which frightens the horses.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08042137000009"></a>I think that we want to hear more from the Government, and particularly about what the Minister and the Government consider to be extreme images, before we make a decision. As I understand it, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has put forward two options. The first option set out in the first group of amendments seeks to amend the Bill, and if that does not work, the second group would strike the whole lot out. As we implied in Committee, we want to hear more from the Government before we come to a view. I do not know whether it is appropriate, but the noble Baroness might want to come back at Third Reading, particularly as the noble Lord has now taken a look at some of the extreme pornographic things that he invited me to see. At that stage, and after hearing what the Minister has to say, the noble Baroness may want to consider these matters again.</p>

One of them was commissioned by the Turkish ambassador in around 1860. It is a close-up painting of a lady&#146;s genitalia, and I believe it is called the Mother of the World&#151;</p>

My bet is that the Turkish ambassador commissioned that painting for sexual arousal, and yet there it is, displayed in the Mus&#233;e d&#146;Orsay. Some Greek vases have pictures of Priapus on them. If Priapus was to do the things he is threatening to do, it is fairly likely, because of the size of what he has got, that they would result in serious injury to a person&#146;s bits and pieces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08042137000014"></a>We are here in the problem of definition. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, has said that surely it should be left in people&#146;s bedrooms or on the television sets in their bedrooms. Actually, I do not see why someone cannot have a picture of a person having oral sex with a dead animal. It is the most extraordinary thing anyone would want to do, but I cannot see why that should be made criminal. It does not harm the animal because it is dead. The person concerned ought to be carted off in a collar and chain and put in the loony bin, but it does not do anybody any harm. Surely the whole point is that what we are trying to get at is undefinable. You probably know it when you see it, but you cannot define it, and statutes must be defined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08042137000015"></a>I have a final little story for your Lordships. Years ago I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, to introduce a programme on pop music. The programme was in six sections, and one of them was on porn rock. I refused to be in any way nice about it. I said that this has been going on for an awfully long time and I quoted Juvenal&#146;s ninth satire, which states,</p>
<ul><a name="08042137000033"></a>&#147;an facile et pronum est agere intra uiscera penem legitimum atque illic hesternae occurrere canae?&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08042137000025"></a>I would not have dared to quote that had Lord Hailsham still been on the Woolsack. He would have got very angry because it is incredibly obscene, but it is one of Juvenal&#146;s ninth satires. All I am trying to say is how difficult these definitions are and how impossibly difficult it is to legislate for. I hope that we take out both these clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08042137000017"></a>It is with these concerns that we have tabled the amendments in the group. If there is going to be a crime established we want to try to get some definition into it. The amendment would make a requirement that the act being recorded, and which is then the subject of the pornographic image, should be one in which one or more of the persons engaged in that act are committing a sexual offence. &#147;Sexual offence&#148; is defined for the purposes of this clause to include offences which could be committed forth of the United Kingdom. One of the concerns mentioned in Committee was that many of these images are imported from outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08042137000018"></a>Clearly, if no sexual offence is being committed, it seems very odd indeed that there should be an offence for having an image of something which was not an offence. I can see nothing within the Bill that would stop a person having a picture of himself or herself engaged in that particular activity, which they would know was entirely consensual. Having engaged in it consensually would not be a crime, but to have a photograph of it in one&#146;s possession would be a crime. That does not seem to me to make sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08042137000019"></a>Amendment No. 86L, spoken to by my noble friend Lady Miller, which indicates that the definition should be imported from the Obscene Publications Act, again has considerable good sense attached to it. After all, in Committee, the Minister tried to indicate that it was important that the parallel was made with the Obscene Publications Act. Things were said about the difficulties and the challenges we face today because of the internet and because of electronic communication of images, difficulties which were not faced back in 1959. Notwithstanding that, I cannot see any reason for departing from the definition which, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said, has stood the test of time of some 50 years, and why we would suddenly have a different set of definitions simply because something might be downloaded from the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08042137000020"></a>Amendment No. 86PA seeks to bring in a defence. The defences in the Bill are very limited indeed. The amendment seeks to create an additional defence whereby a person believes that those involved in the material possessed actually consented to the participation. There may be difficulties in proving that in cases of mass produced pornographic images, but it certainly could be a very useful defence in cases of images of consenting couples or groups which have been made for their own use. It is not open-ended. There is a requirement that the belief must be reasonable. In all these circumstances, the restrictions and the greater definition which the amendments in this group bring forward help to improve the measure. As has been indicated, there is considerable underlying unease about the purpose of the clauses as a whole. I certainly commend the amendments as improving clauses which at the moment do not command sufficient confidence to enable them to become part of our criminal law.</p>

I looked carefully at the amendments that my noble friend brought forward and I said in Committee that I thought that they represented an improvement on what was there before.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0804224000002"></a>I think that I am the only Member of your Lordships&#146; House who took up the invitation of my noble friend to visit Charing Cross police station to view some of what one might call the exhibits that underlie the Government&#146;s thinking on this matter. A variety of adjectives comes to mind, such as &#147;bizarre&#148;, &#147;unpleasant&#148;, &#147;distasteful&#148;, even &#147;repulsive&#148;, but the images were not in any sense sexually arousing. At the end of the visit, I was left with the question whether their possession is so threatening to society that it is worth turning people into criminals and sending them to jail if they happen to have them on a computer screen at home or have obtained them some other way.</p>

<a name="80421-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0804224000003"></a>I suspect that, like me, many noble Lords have had a fair number of submissions on this subject from a variety of organisations. Some of them are very articulate and well argued. The main point that comes through was expressed by an organisation called backlash, which said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_122"></a><a name="0804224000056"></a>&#147;The proposals are still, despite the recent amendments, worded in such a way as to risk inadvertently criminalising hundreds of thousands of British citizens&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804224000052"></a>It went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_123"></a><a name="0804224000057"></a>&#147;Equally importantly, people will be deterred from exploring their sexual preferences for fear that their research may lead them into illegal territory which in turn can cause both distress and mental health issues as well as being a fundamental breach of their human rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80421-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0804224000004"></a>The point is also made by a number of these organisations that most of the scenes to which my noble friend introduced me at Charing Cross are not real scenes but are faked for the benefit of their creation or are the product of an entirely consensual activity, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, pointed out. I am at one with my noble friend Lord McIntosh and, I suspect, with the Minister in wanting to prosecute illegal activity that has taken place in order to create these images. However, if no illegal activity has taken place and we are concerned about merely the possession of the images, I really cannot imagine that any useful purpose is served by creating criminals out of the people who possess them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0804224000005"></a>My worry is that the wording of the Bill is still much too vague and could cover all sorts of light, consensual and safe imagery which many people enjoy and practise and which at present is perfectly legal but which as a consequence of these clauses will certainly become illegal. In Committee, I finished by asking my noble friend a question. I did not get an answer on that occasion and I therefore put the same question to him now. As a new offence is being created by these clauses, what will be the position of people who have already downloaded material on to their computers that until now has not been illegal but henceforth will be? Will the possession of that be regarded as a criminal offence and, if it is, what advice are the Government offering to help people to get rid

A few years ago there was a very famous Italian film. I am afraid that I cannot remember the title. Some of your Lordships may remember it. It won awards all over the world and was highly acclaimed. It was set in Italy in a peasant community about 50 years ago and one of the scenes showed an adolescent farm lad relieving his frustrations with a donkey, standing on a box in the middle of the field in order to do so. I saw this in a large London cinema that was absolutely packed because the film was so highly acclaimed. The audience tittered, as you might expect, but nobody was at all shocked or offended. The Government will argue that the film was not produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal and, indeed, that is the case. But suppose that somebody was to download that scene from the film on to a DVD and play it over and over again for their rather peculiar sexual tastes. That would be odd, no doubt, but should they really go to prison for such a thing?</p>

This is a preliminary attempt to do that. The far more important issue will be what we do about all these clauses. In my view, we need a far harder and deeper look at these issues than we are able to give them in this Bill. That is for the later part of the debate. In the mean time, we shall all be interested to hear what is said. I share everybody&#146;s view that, if what is going on in one&#146;s own bedroom is legal, so long as it is not frightening the horses&#151;or whatever phrase you want to use&#151;it may even be doing some good, but we can discuss that later.</p>

The judge was a recently appointed High Court judge, a commercial lawyer by training, and the lady received probation when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of provocation. The next case involved attempted bestiality, so I know a little bit about it in court. That involved two Welshmen and sheep. However, the Welshmen were drunk at the time and the sheep were not violated. That is why it was charged as attempt. The judge who had given the lady probation for killing her husband proceeded to sentence these two to 12 months&#146; imprisonment immediately. They went to the Court of Appeal. They were given immediate bail and eventually the case was disposed of by the appeal court on the basis that it was stupid to have brought the case in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0804224000011"></a>What is this provision in the Bill about? Is it an attempt to punish people for having extreme pornography in their possession or is it an attempt to discourage the commission of acts that we might disapprove of and are contained within the extreme pornography? If you cannot sell a picture or a film or a video, presumably the thinking is that there is no point in such acts taking place in the first place.  One has this dilemma: if those acts are not criminal  in themselves&#151;a matter to which my noble friend Lady Miller and other noble Lords referred&#151;punishing a person for having pictures of them seems rather silly.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0804224000012"></a>That is what these amendments are about. That is why we on these Benches seek to put into the clause a condition that the act that is shown is criminal. If it is not criminal&#151;if it is consensual&#151;where is the harm? One has to be clear about what one is seeking to punish. What is the motivation? Is it distaste for people watching pornographic films or is it an attempt to discourage illegal conduct? We would go along with an attempt to discourage illegal conduct but not with an attempt to discourage consensual sex that takes place between two people in whatever form it may be. I share the distaste for pornography expressed by many noble Lords. As a classical scholar, I fully understood the depths of obscenity to which the noble Earl descended. I do not see that that is any reason for maintaining this clause in its current state. I respectfully urge on your Lordships that the amendment be accepted.</p>

I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said in her introductory remarks that she accepts some of the spirit behind the Government&#146;s legislative proposals, but clearly there is concern about the way in which they have been drafted. I very much understand the point made by my noble friend Lord McIntosh, to whom it is a great pleasure to respond. He spoke of being aware of legislation that seeks to intrude too much into the individual lives of people where, as he said, harm is not caused to others. I very much understand the concerns expressed by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, said that it is all right unless it frightens the horses. I do not know about the horses, but the material that I saw at Charing Cross police station certainly frightened me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0804224000014"></a>While I accept all the concerns expressed by noble Lords tonight, I would also put the other point of view, which is that there is large and genuine public concern about extreme pornographic material, particularly since the growth of the internet, which has allowed existing controls on publication distribution under the Obscene Publications Act to be circumvented. There is also concern about the adverse influence that that material might have on those watching it. It is not simply material that potentially causes arousal. The tests that have to be applied are, I suggest, high tests. There are three elements that have to be met for someone to be found guilty of the new offence. First, material has to be pornographic; then, it has to be concerned with extreme acts, which are described as threatening a person&#146;s life or as resulting or being likely to result in,</p>
<ul><a name="0804224000059"></a>&#147;serious injury to a person&#146;s anus, breast or genitals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804224000053"></a>It also has to be,</p>
<ul><a name="0804224000060"></a>&#147;an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse&#148;, </ul>
<p><a name="0804224000054"></a>or an act concerning,</p>
<ul><a name="0804224000061"></a>&#147;a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804224000015"></a>Those acts must be &#147;explicit and realistic&#148;; persons and animals depicted must be such that &#147;a reasonable person&#148; would think them real. The third element of the test is that it must be,</p>
<ul><a name="0804224000062"></a>&#147;offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804224000055"></a>That is why many of the examples raised in our debates about works of art simply would not meet the tests described in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="0804224000016"></a><a name="80421-0016.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80421-0016.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0804224000172"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> My Lords, the Minister said that, when he went down to the Charing Cross station, some of the material that he saw certainly succeeded in frightening him. Would he go beyond that and say that it affected him in a manner where he felt that he might commit violence following on from viewing those acts? If I understand the Government&#146;s rapid evidence assessment&#151;it was, as we know from the Committee stage, a highly contested exercise&#151;there was conflicting and contested evidence as to whether simply viewing some of these acts would lead anyone to go out and violently commit those acts themselves against people.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0804224000017"></a>Secondly, the Minister comes to the tests. He uses the words &#147;graphic&#148; and &#147;realistic&#148;. Does he accept that much of the material is produced by consenting adults&#151;much of it may well have consensual acts in its production&#151;and may comprise a great deal of acting? Would he not agree that in acting one may project an image that is threatening or violent, or whatever, in order to be fantastical, and that that is perfectly fine in areas of art? It is rather odd that he uses such tests in this area and says that these tests therefore have a high threshold. Drama is, indeed, about simulating death and many other things. Might the Minister be able to explain that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0804224000019"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether, having viewed these images at Charing Cross police station a couple of weeks ago, I then felt violent or that I would indulge in some offence. I actually felt very sick, because they were pretty disgusting images, and I frankly find it horrific that they are available and that people can see them. I am sorry, but I do not take this very liberal approach of &#147;If it does no harm to the people taking part, why should we worry about it?&#148; I do worry about it, and about the access that people have to that kind of disgusting material. I am afraid that is my position.</p>

I suspect that we will, in the end, have to come to a value judgment on this matter. Frankly, I want to discuss why the Government would have difficulty with the amendments, and the House will then no doubt want to take a decision on that view&#151;either today or at another stage.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0804224000022"></a>Clearly, the effect of the amendments that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has put forward is to add an additional element to the offence; namely, that the image concerned depicts an actual sexual offence. In order to come within the terms of the offence, an image would have to depict a specified extreme act in an explicit and realistic way. As a consequence, only graphic and convincing scenes would be caught. To go further than that and to require that the image is a record of a sexual offence being carried out would make the clauses more or less inoperable for two reasons. First, the issue with most extreme pornography is not that a sexual or any other offence may or may not have been committed. As I said, much of the material that I saw, which has been found by the Metropolitan Police, might be prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, but would not satisfy a test that a sexual offence had been committed. The proposed amendment would render the offence inapplicable in respect of such material. I do not run away from this because the point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, in his intervention. We are targeting that material not on account of offences which may or may not have been committed in the production of the material, but because the material itself, which depicts extreme violence and often appears to be non-consensual, is to be deplored.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0804224000023"></a>Secondly, the other problem is that if there were a suspicion that a sexual offence had taken place, that would be pursued by applying the existing criminal law here. However, it is far more likely to have been  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1359"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>produced in other countries and part of the problem that we face is mainly because of the internet. Often it applies to a different jurisdiction. To make a prosecution for possession of the image contingent on the prosecution first, determining from that image whether or not a sexual offence had taken place, and secondly, obtaining the necessary evidence and witnesses to prove the elements of that offence beyond a reasonable doubt, would be to make such a prosecution all but impossible. As I said, most of the extreme pornography is produced outside our own jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0804224000024"></a>The noble Baroness has tabled amendments in the second group that would remove the offence altogether. The advice that I have received is that the amendments in this group would create almost the same impact. Amendment No. 86PA would create a new defence applicable where the defendant reasonably believed that no one portrayed in the image concerned was coerced. I am aware that the noble Lord has concerns about individuals who keep a record of themselves freely and willingly participating in bondage,  domination, submission and sado-masochistic practices in which no unlawful harm occurs. I recognise that it would be anomalous for a person to be committing an offence by possessing an image of an act which he undertook perfectly lawfully. We intend to introduce at Third Reading a defence which addresses precisely that situation.</p>

<a name="80421-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0804224000025"></a>Noble Lords will have to apply a value judgment to this issue. I take them back to the elements of the offence. This is not intended to catch the kind of art to which noble Lords have referred. The three elements of the test ensure that it is only this extremely nasty pornography that in no circumstances could be counted as art, which will be covered. As a society we have a duty to protect people. It is appalling that this material is available and we have to do something about it.</p>

Pushing this was one of the Government&#146;s weakest suits, so perhaps it is not altogether surprising that he did not refer to it this time. In the debate we have just had, the issue of whether we are talking about violence or sexual arousal is still confused.

I do not want to stand here as an apologist for people who commit those sorts of offences against women. I feel very strongly that we need to stamp down on that sort of violence, but it is the violence that should be addressed, not the sorts of issues that the Minister has just been talking about.

I agree with the Minister that society has a problem, but how often has he watched television after 11 pm? All the free-to-view channels are absolutely stuffed with sex and violence that anybody can watch. While it may not be as extreme&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0804224000040"></a>One substantial difficulty that I have had with the rapid evidence assessment that the Minister sent me between Committee and Report is that I discovered in reading it that an awful lot of the assessed evidence was produced before the internet was even widely available. Worse, however, is the fact that one of the assessors was one of those who wrote some of the research paper. That is particularly reprehensible. I have had communications with 40 academics, apart from the interest groups who obviously have an interest, who are deeply worried by the Governments&#146; position.

We said that this was not something to be stuffed into a Bill in a small way like this. The Minister and I are clearly never going to agree on the fact. It is a matter not of personal conscience but of evidence. If we do not have any evidence to intrude on people&#146;s lives, I do not make an apology. A liberal point of view is that we should not do so unless there is evidence of harm. Common sense tells us that the Minister is on weak ground because his own assessment has not produced any evidence.

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0804227000010"></a>There is considerable disquiet among the public about child sex offences. It is a disquiet that everybody shares. It can give rise to strong emotions that can, in some situations, turn into violence against an individual. That is the basis upon which I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the fact that the general public&#146;s distaste for&#151;indeed, hatred of&#151;child sex offences is sometimes used as a weapon by people who have strong views about homosexuality. It does happen in our society that in order to stir up hatred against someone who is homosexual, an allegation is made that they are nothing more than a paedophile. I have experience of that causing great violence, harm and hurt to individuals who are homosexual.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0804227000011"></a>It could be said that &#147;threatening&#148; already includes an association between sexual orientation and a propensity to commit child sex offences, but we believe that it is necessary to spell this out so that people who seek to attack individuals because of their homosexuality should beware of what they say and what associations they make between the sexual orientation of the person they are talking about and the crime of paedophilia. I beg to move.</p>

I have great sympathy with what lies behind it. I agree that allegations that gay people are prone to being paedophiles are particularly damaging and distasteful and that such allegations should be challenged vigorously. I also agree that in many instances those allegations will be threatening and intended to stir up hatred. Where we have a slight disagreement regarding the Bill is our belief that when such allegations are threatening and intended to stir up hatred, they will be covered by the offence. Where they are made in a way which is not threatening, they will not be covered. We think that that is right.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0804227000013"></a>I understand that the noble Lord has moved his amendment in order to send a signal. Allegations of paedophilia will always be damaging and invidious in the context of stirring up hatred; it is a matter which we hear and read about too often. But we see a risk of extending the offence in a way which will stretch the meaning of &#147;threatening&#148;. It could make the offence less clear if we do not stick to the normal meaning.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0804227000014"></a>There are many allegations we may find distasteful, but that does not mean that there are grounds for making all such allegations criminal offences. In the debate on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, we will discuss the question of freedom of speech and the balance to be drawn. Allegations that are threatening or that raise public order concerns can justify some restrictions on free speech, but the same cannot be said of all allegations that are simply distasteful.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0804227000015"></a>We are not persuaded that this amendment will make the offence more effective. We know that there are individuals and organisations that are ready to equate homosexuality with being a paedophile, but if we make such allegations specifically illegal it will be easy for those organisations and individuals to shift their allegations and perhaps take up some other line of attack. For example, as I mentioned in Committee,

I will not, however, waste the time of the House by voicing my indignation, and I will go straight to the meat of the matter.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0804227000022"></a>This morning, I received a very moving letter from the mother of a young man whom she believes was brutally murdered because he was gay. I can well understand such a person being desperately anxious that nothing should be done to weaken the protection which they hope may be afforded to gays by this new hate crime offence. I therefore start by making it plain that I did not in Committee, and do not now, seek to weaken the protection that the Government&#146;s proposal is designed to give gay people. I have never set out to narrow the scope of the provision. My intention has been absolutely clear: to make clear what both the Government and I agree is outside the scope of the provision. By so doing, I hope to prevent any repetition of the scandals of recent years.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1366"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0804227000023"></a>In our debate in Committee, a number of noble Lords expressed their general support for a free speech provision, but they also voiced criticisms of the then amendment. With the help of colleagues, to whom I am immensely indebted, we set out to meet all the concerns that were expressed in Committee and to find a form of words that were neutral and that could not by the greatest stretch of imagination be thought to be aimed at gays and calculated to encourage homophobic attitudes and behaviour towards them. I hope noble Lords will agree that, in seeking common ground and consensus, we observed the best traditions of this House. That is what it should be all about.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0804227000024"></a>Some might say that the amendment is now so moderate in its terms that it merely states the obvious and is therefore unnecessary, but those who say that are, I fear, closing their eyes to what has really happened in recent years. The scandals to which we have often referred could not have occurred unless the police and sometimes the prosecution authorities had thought that threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour&#151;the requisites for prosecution under the present Public Order Act&#151;could be inferred from mere comment or criticism. How else can one explain the prosecution to conviction of the Bournemouth preacher, the investigation of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, the arrest of Robin Page for a tasteless joke at a country fair, and the arrest and prosecution to conviction of the Oxford student for his jest about a gay horse? How else can one explain the interrogation of Lynette Burrows following comments about gay adoption, and the thoroughly disgraceful interrogation of the Fleetwood couple after they had complained about their council&#146;s gay rights policy? If the police under the old law assumed that words about sexual matters must have been threatening and likely to cause distress without any supporting evidence to that effect, why should it be assumed that they would not infer threats and intention to stir up hatred under the new law?</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0804227000025"></a>In Committee, the Minister suggested that all our concerns might be met by guidance. But if guidance can be clear, so can the words of a statute. Surely our words are clear enough. Furthermore, guidance was in existence when all the abuses to which I have referred occurred, and which it entirely failed to prevent. Perhaps that was in part because the guidance was erroneous. When I read <I>Policy for Prosecuting Cases with a Homophobic Element</I>, published by the Crown Prosecution Service, I was astonished to find that it contained a definition of homophobia which does not correspond with that in any of the dictionaries that I have consulted. By my book, homophobia is hatred or fear of homosexuality or homosexuals. But the Crown Prosecution Service has invented its own definition and says that it embraces dislike, not hatred, of a person&#146;s lifestyle.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0804227000026"></a>I must make another point. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, did not really address the undesirability of there being a free speech clause in the religious hatred offence but no free speech clause here. The noble Lord said that the free speech clause in the religious hatred offence had been added against the wishes of the Government, who had not thought that it was  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1367"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary. But the Government have accepted the position and have not chosen, for instance, to remove the provision during the passage of this Bill. I cannot believe that the noble Lord really thinks that it is desirable that there should be a free speech clause in the religious hatred offence but no free speech provision here.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0804227000027"></a>The dangers are obvious of the police being led to believe that preservation of free speech is an important consideration in the one case, but not in the other. It is no good to say that there is no free speech clause in the racial hatred offence and that its absence has not caused trouble. When it comes to language touching on matters of sexual orientation, there has already been a load of trouble with the police misapplying the existing Public Order Act. It is our plain duty to try to prevent this continuing to happen.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0804227000028"></a>Finally, the Minister referred to rap lyrics urging the killing of gay men and the hanging of lesbians. His comments seem somewhat irrelevant, for I doubt whether he thinks that his new offence will do much, if anything, to stop the use of such lyrics. I cannot believe that he thinks that a free speech amendment would license them. Instead of raising such irrelevances, it would be helpful if he would make plain that encouragement of violence against gays, or for that matter anyone else, is now already an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007, which makes criminal the encouragement of crime&#151;for example, the encouragement of violence against a person or a class of persons.</p>

<a name="80421-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0804227000029"></a>Plainly, my amendment will not weaken the protection sought to be given to gays. It is a sensible provision to prevent the repetition of abuses which have occurred all too often under the Public Order Act and to secure free speech. I commend it to the House and beg to move.</p>

I am now more convinced than ever that the amendment before us is very necessary. If the House agrees with the amendment, it will do much to allay the doubt that troubles many people like me. On  3 March I quoted from one of the letters I had received, and this evening I would like to quote from a letter I have received in the past few days. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has already referred to the people who wrote from Fleetwood. Because of the hour, I will not read out the whole of the letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0804227000032"></a>The letter is from two people who describe themselves as pensioners and Christians. They heard that the council where they live wanted to display homosexual leaflets around the area. The couple asked a council officer whether they could distribute Christian leaflets. They were told that no, they could not. The reason given by the official was that homosexuals would find it very offensive. They said that they were not aggressive and did not raise their voices. They went home. Two or three days later they found out that the man they spoke to at the council had alerted the police. Two six-foot tall policemen turned up at their door and they were interrogated in their own front room for 80 minutes. They were accused of making homophobic phone calls to the council. I will not go into the detail, but thank God that common sense prevailed. After a year of worry and stress, the police and the council eventually made a full apology which made the national news. Many noble Lords will know about the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0804227000033"></a>Let us imagine it: two pensioners sitting in their front room, terrified by the police walking in. These are the things that I have opposed all my adult life, whether in apartheid South Africa, in Iran or in many other parts of the world. I was proud, as a member of the Labour Party and chairman of its international committee, to argue for free speech, and I find it hard to come to this House and have to plead that your Lordships will back a simple amendment that clarifies the issue and makes clear that there will be no infringement of free speech.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0804227000034"></a>On 3 March I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_132"></a><a name="0804227000070"></a>&#147;The concept of bringing in laws that forbid the precious right of free speech in our society is in itself a frightening prospect. In a nation such as ours, with proud traditions of freedom, even contemplating the suppression of opinions is frightening to all who genuinely want to be able to speak out against that which they think is wrong, harmful and potentially dangerous&#151;they fear they will be treated as criminals. It is indeed frightening. Is this what our Government want?&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/08; col. 927.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804227000059"></a>I ask again: is this what the Government I have worked for all my adult life to get elected want? I find it offensive, and many of the people I have worked with over the years share my views.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0804227000035"></a>In previous debates the Government have said that a free speech clause is unnecessary. It is said that the wording of the offence already strikes the right balance between preventing the incitement of hatred and the protection of free speech. If that is so, why not underline the need for balance by including a free speech clause? It is very straightforward. From what I have read, the Government do not object in principle to such a clause.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0804227000036"></a>I was quite surprised when I was given a copy of a letter sent to my noble friend Lord Stoddart of Swindon&#151;he is my noble friend. The letter takes up the issue of the Racial and Religious Hatred  Act 2002. I may be a bit touchy, and as I get older I feel things that I should not, but this is a Minister writing to a Member of this House:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133"></a><a name="0804227000071"></a>&#147;I should also like to take the opportunity to clarify one further point, which you raised in your speech ... For the offence of stirring up religious hatred, Parliament added a clause to safeguard free speech. We did not then think it was necessary, and we do not think so now. But Parliament decided&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="0804227000060"></a>Where I come from, that smacks of arrogance: Parliament makes a decision, but they still think they were right, and above the will of Parliament. I find that a little bit odd.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0804227000037"></a>My view is that the criminal law should be clear in explaining what is and what is not an offence. If the Bill is enacted without a clause that protects freedom of expression, religious believers will be uncertain about what they can say as well as uncertain as to what they may discuss or debate on the subject of homosexual practice in their teachings.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0804227000038"></a>I urge the House to give wholehearted support to the amendment and to demonstrate to the Government that we are seeking to protect the very precious principle of free speech. At Second Reading a number of illustrations were given by noble Lords that there is quite a lot of evidence that the public, the police and, on occasions, some courts have failed to take sufficient account of the protection of freedom of expression in cases which involve criticism of the practice of homosexuality. This is not about that issue; it is about the right of people to have a point of view and to express it. I hope that the House will support the amendment.</p>

Where there is an entirely disproportionate reaction to criticism by one group of another of the sort we have heard from my noble friend Lord Waddington and from the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, will he pause to think what effect that is going to have on relations between the two groups in question? It must exacerbate them and therefore in order to achieve the policy objectives which the Minister has in bringing this before Parliament, there must surely be a clause such as my noble friend has devised to prevent that happening.</p>

I spoke against it in Committee and my views have not changed, even though there has been a slight amendment to the original wording. I believe that it is necessary because there has been an increase in homophobic violence, some of it ending in death, as has already been reported. The Government are to be commended on introducing this Bill, which is designed to try to deal with that. It refers to incitement to hatred. It is not about expressions of opinion, it is about incitement to hatred. Clearly, that should be deplored in any event. It leads eventually to the commitment of homophobic actions.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0804227000041"></a>I have had a number of letters about this amendment, some in support and some not. Those in support have often said that they oppose it on grounds of religion because they take the view that this is anti-Christianity. I have to say to my noble friend that I, as I am sure have a number of other noble Lords, have a number of friends who are devout Christians. For example, I was able last year to go to the civil ceremony of a couple of friends of mine, both of whom are devout Christians  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1370"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and both of whom spend a lot of time doing good works which they feel is an expression of their Christianity. Certainly, it is by no means a view held throughout the Christian community that this kind of action should be taken in relation to homosexuals. Not everybody holds the same view about homosexuality as the people who wrote to me in support of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0804227000042"></a>The Government have done the right thing in introducing this provision in the Bill. We are not talking about religion as far as the religious incitement is concerned, the different arrangements in relation to religious hatred and so on. Religion is a belief whereas sexual orientation may be a state of being. Therefore different arrangements should apply. It seems to me that the Government have made a genuine attempt to try to deal with an increasing problem of homophobia and violence against gays and lesbians. I think that they should be supported for it and I commend them for doing so.</p>

It is much more moderate and makes no mention whatever of homosexuality. People should not only have a legal right to urge others to refrain from certain sexual practices, in certain circumstances I submit they have a moral duty to do so.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="0804227000044"></a>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by the United Kingdom, deems a child to be anyone under the age of 18, and as such deserving of protection from physical and mental harm. In consequence of a change in the law about seven and a half years ago, forced through under the Parliament Act against the better judgment of the great majority of your Lordships, 16 and 17 year-olds can now legally be subjected to medically dangerous sexual practices in addition to relatively safe practices to which there can be much less objection. This is all the more paradoxical in the light of the Government&#146;s determination with all the powers at their command to try to prevent under-18s from smoking, which in statistical terms is decidedly less dangerous than being sodomised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="0804227000045"></a>As I said on the previous occasion, there is very little danger in practice of anyone being sent to prison for seven years, seven months or even seven weeks if this extremely modest and moderate amendment is rejected by the Government for the simple reason that no British jury would convict. However, there will on the other hand be a very great danger of the unfortunate ordinary policeman and policewoman being urged on by politically correct chief constables to step up their harassment of critics of such behaviour just as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, Lynette Burrows, Robin Page and many others were inexcusably harassed.</p>

However, let us not forget that the background against which the Government have placed this measure in the Bill is that every single day in this civilised country of ours people are abused, attacked, have hatred expressed against them and on some occasions suffer extreme violence simply because of their sexuality. That is the background which has led to the introduction of the measure in the Bill. In my book incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation is as unforgivable and unacceptable in a civilised society as incitement to hatred on grounds of race or colour. I believe that it may have been when the noble Lord who moved this amendment served in the Home Office that that provision was rightly brought into the law of this land.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="0804227000047"></a>It seems to me that this amendment falls foul of two things. First, if it is simply about allowing people to express a view it is unnecessary because the measure as it stands in the Bill allows the expression of views. It is incitement to hatred that the measure is about. If all that the proposer of this amendment is interested in is ensuring that people should be free to speak their conscience, there is nothing in the Bill as it stands which prevents them doing so.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="0804227000048"></a>However, I have a greater fear about this amendment. For all the moderation and the consensual way in which the noble Lord quite rightly introduced it, my worry is that it will drive a coach and horses through the intention of the clause and it will allow those who stand up and incite hatred to take refuge in this clause, if it is amended, in justifying their behaviour. That to me would be a step backwards. Let us ensure that the law of the land protects the life and person of people whose only crime happens to be being different in their sexual orientation.</p>

As with any argument, there is an argument on one side and there is an argument on the other side. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, said that day after day people were being damaged for being homosexuals. We all agree that that should not happen, so the ball can swing the other way and people can find that the things that they are doing which have been considered perfectly normal and reasonable are now coming under the sight of being illegal. One person said very effectively that a Christian who declares to an adulterer the Bible&#146;s teaching that adultery is wrong should not be made a criminal by the state and face a jail sentence of up to seven years. That is so whether he is talking to an adulterer or a homosexual. People ought to be allowed to say what their views&#151;and their religious views&#151;are. We have heard the problems of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. The police went over his speech because it was thought that he had said something wrong. I do not believe that that is what the law should encourage people to do. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Waddington, is, if I might respectfully say so, very carefully drawn so as not to infringe the Government&#146;s desires to protect homosexuals; it  merely states:</p>

<p><a name="0804227000061"></a>So the Government&#146;s desires to protect those who are homosexually oriented remain but the right to the freedom of speech also remains. I hope the Minister will have a broad mind over this because it is wrong to curtail the freedom of speech and without this amendment clarifying that, there is a great danger that that would happen.</p>

In its original form it would have exempted certain sorts of speech or writing about sexual conduct from prosecution, even if they were threatening or intending to stir up hatred. Had I been able to be present then, I could not have supported it. But this new version is for the avoidance of doubt and so the question really hinges on whether it is necessary.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="0804227000051"></a>If we take the view that the definition of the offence is both sufficiently clear and narrow and the word used is threatening&#151;not insulting, not abusive, but threatening&#151;and if the Bill already meets concerns about possible loss of freedom of expression, that makes the amendment unnecessary. If, on the other hand, the argument is that the amendment will not do any harm and it conceivably might do some good in protecting freedom of expression, it can be entertained for two reasons. The first is that it would give some protection from petty harassment by overzealous police officers investigating vexatious complaints, as indeed has happened. Secondly, it can be argued that the amendment would be helpful in meeting concerns about the so-called chilling effect of the Bill on free speech and expressions of opinion. We need to listen carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Smith, said. On balance, my view still is that what the amendment says would be much better in guidance to the police and to the prosecuting authorities on the interpretation of the Bill than it would be in the Bill.</p>

Would the jury or the magistrates consider it to be threatening if those words were used about them? The second ingredient of intent to &#147;stir up ... hatred&#148; requires the jury or magistrates to be satisfied about the state of mind of the defendant and that he intended to stir up hatred.

That is not enough to satisfy the ingredients of this serious offence that the Government now propose to put on the statute book. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="0804227000053"></a>Freedom of speech is not derived by clauses inserted into every statute for the avoidance of doubt. Freedom of speech is derived from our common law heritage and, if necessary, we can go to the European convention to see it all set out. Every time there is an issue, it is not necessary to put it into an Act of Parliament. There is no question of any doubt arising here about the interpretation of the statute&#151;absolutely none. It is clear what the prosecution has to prove. I concur with the right reverend Prelate that if, in the future, there is a suggestion that police officers are acting outside their proper ambit, firm and direct guidance should be given to them by the Attorney-General and by the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is how we can cope with this. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has done his best to modify the language of the previous amendment, but the result would be a clause that says nothing. It would not add in any way to the freedoms of expression that we enjoy. I regret to say that we on these Benches will not be able to support the amendment.</p>

It may be that there would be very few, if any, prosecutions. But surely that is not the point. I guess that many of us have been impressed by letters from individuals around the country who have been met with overzealous police officers who have caused great anxiety until eventually the individuals have been told that no prosecutions will follow. Surely, the aim of this quite modest amendment would be to deter such overzealous police officers from causing such anxiety. I believe that this amendment is indeed modest, and I will have no hesitation in supporting it.</p>

He got a call from two policemen, and was followed up again because there had been complaints from a homosexual supporter that there was something wrong in that way about the leaflet. There was not, but much upset was caused to that man&#146;s family&#151;and to his neighbours, who thought that he had created some terrible fault and done something wrong.

None the less, I think that the noble Lord would agree that he has had a good debate, and that the matters discussed have been raised very clearly indeed.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="0804227000058"></a>I want to say at once that I understand the issues that the noble Lord and others have raised; it is described as a chilling effect, this concern that the passage of this legislation would unnecessarily inhibit the absolute right of freedom of speech. I certainly understand those concerns, but none the less the Government continue to believe strongly that the kind of clarification in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, which differs from his in Committee, is not necessary. I am very happy to place on the record that it is indeed possible to discuss these topics or to criticise conduct in ways that are neither threatening nor intentionally &#147;stir up hatred&#148;. In such cases, it would be plain from the meaning of the statute that no offence has been committed. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made a most important point when he described the process by which a jury would have to come to a decision. The key phrase here involves threatening or intentionally stirring up hatred.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="0804229000002"></a>I understand that this amendment&#146;s wording differs from those that we have seen previously. It seeks to ensure that discussions or criticisms of sexual practices are not in themselves taken as threatening, or are,</p>
<ul><a name="0804229000032"></a>&#147;intended to stir up hatred&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0804229000030"></a>all of which is,</p>
<ul><a name="0804229000033"></a>&#147;for the avoidance of doubt&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804229000031"></a>Yet I do not see how any doubt can arise from the offence, as my noble friend Lord Smith and the noble Lord, Lord Turner, have said. Only words or behaviour that are threatening and,</p>
<ul><a name="0804229000034"></a>&#147;intended to stir up hatred&#148;,</ul>
<a name="80421-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="0804229000003"></a>are covered. That is abundantly clear; it will of course, be for the courts to decide whether, in all the circumstances, the words or behaviour were threatening&#151;and the police and the Crown Prosecution Service will need to make a judgment about the circumstances and whether a prosecution would be likely to succeed. There should be no need to add anything to an offence for the avoidance of doubt if it is well drafted and leaves no room for doubt. I do not believe that the offence, as drafted, leaves any room for doubt whatever.</p>

<a name="80421-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="0804229000004"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s intention is to protect free speech, which is an entirely desirable intent. But the proposed new law covers only conduct that is both threatening and intends to stir up hatred on the basis of sexual orientation. We then come to the question raised by the right reverend Prelate, who answered it very effectively. As my noble friend Lord Smith said, any move that was thought to water down what is contained in the Bill as it is might be taken as giving a green light to the sort of conduct that we do not wish to happen. If, as in this case, we seek to clarify rather than change the law, why would that be necessary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="0804229000005"></a>I know that, as there is a specific saving for freedom of expression in the religious hatred legislation, the absence of such a provision in the homophobic legislation might suggest to the police and others that they need not worry about freedom of expression in this context. I greatly admire my noble friend and must say to him that, if in my letter I am guilty of arrogance, I apologise. There was no intent on my part. All that I was seeking to suggest is that, although Parliament put that provision into that Bill, the Government did not think that it was necessary and we do not think that it is necessary in relation to this Bill. I hope that that is not arrogance; I am simply expressing the Government&#146;s view. My noble friend knows me. I would hate to be thought of as arrogant and I hope that noble Lords do not think that I am.</p>

<p><a name="0804214000008"></a>The noble Baroness said: It is an honour to open the batting. I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, to her first Grand Committee as a Minister. I am sure that she will enjoy it immensely. There is no need to extend the same courtesy to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, because he is by now a veteran.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000009"></a>In addressing this group of amendments, I take the Committee back to Second Reading, which was held just before the recess. As noble Lords will recall from that lengthy debate, in which a great many speakers took part, there is consensus that the underlying aim of the Bill is to be welcomed. The bringing together of health, social care and mental health care is something with which noble Lords agree. However, since the Bill entered another place, there has been persistent and underlying concern that the framework as set out in the Bill is insufficient to carry the expectation of  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bringing together the regulation of three considerably different activities&#151;health, social care and mental health&#151;in a way that would not only ensure the ongoing work being done by the individual commissions to a very high standard but set a framework for the future.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000010"></a>It is customary on these occasions in this Room for the Opposition to spend many hours insisting that to ensure that Parliament&#146;s intentions are implemented, measures must be in the legislation. It is equally customary for the Government to argue that the inclusion of any such measures in statute is unnecessary, either because that would be too detailed or because, following a classic line of legal argument, it is preferable to omit stuff from law as putting it in that means you are being exclusive. This time, that argument will not stand; it was comprehensively and fatally undermined by the Government when they published the job description and the recruitment materials for the chair of the Care Quality Commission. The bias in that job towards healthcare and acute healthcare was unmistakable. The job was described in terms equivalent to the chair of a strategic health authority. The bias was unmissable in that it completely failed to require that candidates have any experience or knowledge of local government and failed to mention the introduction of comprehensive area assessment, the key measure under which most social care services will be commissioned and which will stand from next year.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000011"></a>The message could not have been clearer that this was going to be a health body and that social care and mental health care would be tacked on&#151;not quite as an afterthought, but very much as poor relations. As anyone who sat through Second Reading knows, that is simply not acceptable. It is not the basis on which health and social care services are going to be developed in this country in the foreseeable future, not least because all political parties and almost all practitioners and users are of the view that health and social care and mental health care services should be brought together but that this needs to happen on a basis of clarity.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000012"></a>In light of that job description&#151;one of the most memorable of all time&#151;it would have been understandable if opposition Members had reacted to the Bill in ways that were understandable but inappropriate. It would have been reasonable for opposition Members to insist on tying down the nature of the commission in great detail, but I hope the Minister will agree that the amendments we have tabled, with the exception of those probing specific issues, show that we have not done that. We have sought to address what remained as the key outstanding issues on what an independent regulator for these three functions should be like.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000013"></a>I hope that on that basis we can dispense with our traditional arguments and proceed to a worthwhile discussion about exactly what the purpose, nature, structure and remit of this organisation should be. It has a hugely important job to do. It will regulate expenditure of more than &#163;100 billion&#151;10 per cent of our gross domestic product. It will oversee the registration and performance of 28,000 providers of care, which vary from acute teaching hospitals, such as the ones over the water, through to tiny little independent care  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC199"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>homes. That is a massive job. If this regulator fails to do its duty, that will impact on the lives of pretty well every older person, most children and a fair percentage of adults in the country.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000014"></a>Many of the amendments that we will discuss in the coming days reflect the reality outside, which is that at all levels, from the strategic development of policy on the future of public services down to local operational decisions, healthcare, particularly acute healthcare, receive greater attention and a greater amount of public funding. Yet, as the Wanless report showed so clearly, it is important that social care be funded and organised in such a way that it promotes well-being, particularly for older people, rather than concentrating solely on the treatment of acute illness. If we had a regulator doing that, its priorities, as set out in the legislation, would be very different from those in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000015"></a>In this Bill, the House has a unique opportunity to ensure that the future of our largest public service is focused on long-term improvement of the health of the nation, rather than on acute illness. It is an opportunity that we should not let pass by.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000016"></a>I turn to the amendment. The existing bodies, CSCI and the Healthcare Commission, have regulatory objectives set out in statute. CSCI has the objective of encouraging improvement in the provision of English local authority social services; the Healthcare Commission has a similar duty. As it stands, the Bill gives the Care Quality Commission a very weak set of duties that are tantamount to it being a registration, review and reporting body without clear objectives which is insufficiently independent of the Secretary of State. Were the Bill to pass unamended, it would be remarkable that a regulator would exist without objectives. All other major regulatory bodies in this country have clear objectives set out in statute. In his review of legal services&#151;the precursor to the Legal Services Act 2007&#151;Sir David Clementi said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0804214000050"></a>&#147;the first step in defining the regulatory regime should be to make clear what the objectives of the regime should be. This is critical ... since the objectives represent the criteria against which they must determine ... regulatory action; and against which they will be held accountable&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000017"></a>I have proposed in Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 a new set of regulatory objectives for the CQC. This will bring about clarity, not just for those who will be responsible for carrying out the regulatory function, but for all the other players in the health and social care field who will interact with this body. It will not be the only body that has concerns about improvement, complaints or user involvement, nor will it be the only one responsible for inspecting healthcare&#151;about 60 different bodies are responsible for inspecting the NHS. It is important that the role, duties and the whole basis for the actions which the regulator will take need to be understood and clearly set out.</p>
<h5><a name="0804214000052"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000018"></a>One of the key issues addressed in the amendment is what I call &#147;risk versus rights&#148;, which is shorthand used by people who work in social care. Principally, the regulation of healthcare, as it stands, is based on risk. This is not surprising given the serious nature of  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC200"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the work undertaken and its consequences for individual patients; it is a risk-based organisation. In social care, however, things have moved on greatly. The rights of people not only to services but to be treated in ways which ensure their autonomy, dignity and well-being are becoming so fundamental to the whole of provision that if the risk-based approach the Government are proposing for the CQC were to go ahead, the regulatory framework would represent a major step back for the development of social care services.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000019"></a>I draw to the Committee&#146;s attention the duties set out in Amendment No. 1 and the fact that the words &#147;protecting and promoting&#148; those issues on behalf of the public run throughout it. That is the way in which the amendment addresses the issue of rights versus risk.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000020"></a>Amendment No. 3 is different and gives to the Care Quality Commission a duty to promote those objectives. There is no such duty in the legislation as it is set out. It would be strange if in any other field we were to set up a regulator, give it a set of objectives and then not expect it to promote those objectives within its work. If, for example, Ofsted were simply given the job of ensuring that education was not bad as opposed to promoting higher standards and improvement, we would all have something to say. The amendment builds on the work which CSCI and the Healthcare Commission have done in promoting those regulatory objectives during their short time in existence.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000021"></a>Amendment No. 14 seeks to delete much of the wording of Clause 2, most of which is replaced by other amendments. In particular, it seeks to delete subsection (4) and has a similar effect to Amendment No. 22, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The regulator has to be independent of government and if subsection (4) were to remain, that independence might be compromised. Why is it of such importance that a regulator should be independent? I give the example of the FSA and the Treasury, where it is of importance that the bodies have demonstrable independence and different functions in relation to the world of finance. As long as the Department of Health retains a direct involvement in the provision of health services, as it does at the moment, there is a need for the regulator to be strongly independent. That kind of check and balance is only sensible. For all these reasons, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0804214000022"></a><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0804214000056"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I shall speak in particular to Amendment No. 1, to which I have added my name. It is crucial that the objectives should be on the face of the Bill so that everyone knows why the inspectorate is there. There are powers given and the duties and responsibilities which go with them must be clearly laid out. Patients can move between different sectors and may often be in healthcare and social care&#151;and possibly in mental health care&#151;simultaneously. It makes sense to bring the regulators together, but that makes it all the more important that the objectives of the different branches that are now going to be jointly inspected are clear and consistent. </p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000023"></a>As patients move between different sectors, they need to know that all the care they receive, wherever they are, is of a uniformly high standard. In health, they need consistency across the NHS, especially for  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>emergency care provision&#151;not only emergencies occurring outside in the community that cause them to be taken into hospital but also emergencies that arise as a complication of the treatment or investigation that they undergo. It is no good for a patient to be in a unit which is fine at dealing with something until it goes wrong and then have to be taken a long way in a helicopter and put at risk by inordinate delays because there is no adequate infrastructure to deal with complications.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000024"></a>The word &#147;dignity&#148; is rightly used in the amendment, because there is now good evidence that care given in a way that enhances people&#146;s sense of personal dignity, worth and well-being improves their recovery time. If anyone has any doubt about that, I refer them to the work of Harvey Chochinov, who has published several papers on the subject and done sound research into how care is given. Dignity is not an internal construct; it depends on the way that others interrelate with us, react to us and make us feel of value, and on the way that we are asked our opinion, consulted, and how our needs and fears are listened to and addressed.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000025"></a>The word &#147;improvement&#148; comes up in two parts of the amendment, which is crucial. It is too gentle a word to describe what really needs to happen. I would like it stated clearly that &#147;improvement&#148; must encompass research and development, and the educational infrastructure that provides it. Improvement does not happen unless people continually reflect on practice, learn from it, and put in place education and training to improve standards and audit their care.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000026"></a>When we talk about promoting independence, we have in mind particularly those services which sit between health and social care, such as occupational therapy, and which are of key importance. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are often the services which help patients get home. If they are not in place, patients do not get home. The speed with which improvements in occupational therapy in particular are put in place can make all the difference between someone languishing in hospital and deteriorating and their getting home and beginning to resume independent living, with a raft of infrastructure support then being given.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000027"></a>I anticipate the Minister flagging up some difficulties regarding the fourth objective, and I have some sympathy with him. I was unable, however, to come up with better wording. My difficulty is with that word &#147;choice&#148;. In some aspects of service provision in health, it is extremely difficult, if not nigh-on impossible, to promote the exercise of choice and still provide appropriate clinical care, because there is always an outcry when local services are closed or rationalised. The only way to deliver new technologies cost-effectively and use them appropriately is to develop a critical mass and invest in them. A clear example of that is positron emission tomography, or PET as it is known. To turn on the PET scanner is inordinately expensive. The scans that one gets are brilliant and will influence clinical decision-making hugely, but it is not feasible for people to choose to have a PET scan rather than something else if it is not clinically indicated; nor is it appropriate for people to demand that their local service develops PET scan provision because of the complexities of delivering that technology, including the radiation source, which needs to be near a cyclotron.  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is true that patients often ask for scans in the mistaken belief that a scan is some kind of magic investigation that can come up with all the answers, whereas the reality is that scans, whether they are CT scans, MRI or even, occasionally, PET scans, are undertaken to confirm a clinical suspicion of a diagnosis. A negative scan does not mean that disease is not present; it simply means that the amount of disease was not big enough to show up or cast a shadow on a scan.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000028"></a>So there are some difficulties around the word &#147;choice&#148;, but there is an important role for advocacy for patients. Choice is much stronger in social care, where people have a much better knowledge and awareness of what they need to continue living independently. However, even in the health service people need choices over what to where, what to eat, whether they want to be in with other people or whether they desperately want to be in a single room on their own. It is surprising how many patients feel more comfortable surrounded by other patients in a four-bedded bay because of the security of having others around rather than the loneliness of being in a side room.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000029"></a>There are other choices that even in healthcare must be made available, such as the timing of medication. It is tragic to hear of Parkinson&#146;s disease patients who are not given choice over the timing of their medication and whose condition deteriorates hugely during a hospital admission because they do not get their medication on time.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000030"></a>In proposed paragraph (d) of the new clause, I wonder whether we need to look at the wording to make sure that people get the best quality care within the resources available and that there is a just allocation of resources to meet need rather than simply to respond to demand. With that caveat, I give my wholehearted support to having the objectives in the Bill. I could live with the wording as it is in the amendment rather than the alternative of not having the objectives there.</p>

<p><a name="0804214000031"></a><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0804214000057"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I add my strong support to Amendment No. 1, to which I have added my name. Clear objectives are probably more important for this body than for almost any other one can think of. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, the CQC will have to regulate tens of thousands of little businesses, along with very large hospitals. I do not think that we underestimate the enormous challenge that this will present to the organisation. Inevitably, the CQC will prioritise its work. It will probably focus very strongly, initially, on certain areas of work, but it is crucial that neither the CQC nor Parliament ever loses sight of the full breadth of the work that it needs to do.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000032"></a>Will the Minister confirm the Government&#146;s support for all the objectives set out in the amendment? There is the objective of promoting public interest and the interests of users and carers and for users&#146; choice. I recognise the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that inevitably there are types of treatment where choice is impossible. If somebody needs a top security place in Broadmoor, one obviously cannot offer them the choice of going to the hospital down the road. The objective of choice is fundamentally important, although I am not sure whether it really needs to be adjusted to allow for that.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000033"></a>Then there are the objectives of promoting children&#146;s health, of safety, high-quality care, dignity, welfare, independence, the rights of detained patients, social care and public health. I do not believe that any of us could disagree with any one of them, but for the CQC to deliver all of them will be a massive challenge&#151;there is no question about that. For Parliament to keep an eye on all those objectives, it needs to have them in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000034"></a>I hear rumours that the Government want the CQC to concentrate on the most basic safety and care standards to have a single set of standards that can be met by the multitude of independent and voluntary sector provisions and the little, tiny homes, as already referred to. That is a very long way from the excellent work being done by Monitor and the Healthcare Commission with trusts to achieve a gold standard of care. Are the Government committed to ensuring that the CQC works with Monitor to take the gold standard agenda forward along with all its other responsibilities? One could lose all that so easily. That is a very alarming thought for people on the front line, as it would be for patients and service users if they were aware of that danger. It would be an appalling catastrophe for the health service.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000035"></a>We need to know whether the Government are committed to this gold standard agenda or whether the rumours are correct. Is the Government&#146;s primary concern to go along at this low level, achieving a basic standard across the very wide area of provision in social care and healthcare? It is not clear to me that in that case the CQC would have any relevance to most health trusts or any NHS trust and certainly not to foundation trusts, because most of them are way above that level of care and safety.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000036"></a>In fact, I am sure that the Government will want the CQC to be ambitious in raising standards. If that is so, I am sure that the Minister will agree with the words of Sir David Clementi which have already been quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, in relation to the Legal Services Board. As we heard, he underlined the absolute primacy of objectives in setting out to establish a regulatory body. Not surprisingly, many other regulatory bodies have sets of objectives defined in statute: Ofsted, the Food Standards Agency, the Financial Services Authority and Ofcom. Having the objectives in the Bill lets us all know the modus operandi of the organisation. It is clear and transparent but most importantly it enables Parliament to monitor and care for the delivery of those objectives and ensure their fulfilment.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000037"></a>The alternative approach in Amendment No. 4 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, provides, as I understand it, a single focus on the interests of service users and their families and carers. There is of course much to commend in that clarity. However, in view of the considerable risk&#151;I emphasise that it is considerable&#151;that areas of work will be lost by this huge organisation, there is great merit in a fuller statement of regulatory objectives in this context. I hope that the Minister will recognise the strength of the arguments in this case.</p>

<p><a name="0804214000038"></a><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0804214000058"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I should like to think that this amendment or something very like it will commend itself to the Minister and that the arguments ably put forward by all the noble Baronesses will resonate strongly with him. Building a set of overarching objectives into this part of the Bill is, to my mind, tremendously important. There are various ways in which we can do that and there is no doubt that there is a discussion to be had on the precise detail of the objectives, but leaving the first part of the Bill as it is seems to me unacceptable if we want this new body to be a force for public good and to govern its own agenda rather than simply being a tool of the Department of Health or the Ministers of the day. Giving the commission some well defined objectives is part of the buttressing that we need to create to enable it to have independence from Ministers. The less specific the Bill is on what the commission is expected to be and to do, the more scope there is for the sponsoring department to influence its activities.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000039"></a>The other key point was well made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. This will not just be a body that registers people, reviews what they do and then reports back. If it works as it should, it will be one of the positive influences that we can look to in the system to ensure that standards of care across the piece are maintained and improved in accordance with the kind of values that the amendment articulates.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80421-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000040"></a>The present improvement duties set out in Clause 2 are quite vague, whereas the duties under which CSCI currently operates are much more specific. CSCI will say that that is helpful, as it enables it to be more focused in what it does and more consistent in the decisions that it takes and to be and feel more legitimate when exercising its powers. If we are clear about what the commission is for, I think that we are being fair to everyone. We are being fair to those on the receiving end of regulation who are in a better position to know what to expect and why; we are being fair to the commission, which will have a better sense of direction from the outset; and we are being fair to ourselves as legislators, because we will be able to hold the commission more accountable than we might otherwise be able to.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000041"></a>I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, at Second Reading&#151;that we want a regulator capable of adapting to changes in the delivery of health and social care over time. We do not want to come back to the Moses Room after five years to invent yet another sort of regulator, merely as a result of having been too prescriptive about this one. But I do not think that we are talking about being prescriptive here. The values set out in the amendment are manifestly enduring. They should apply, whatever the manner in which care is delivered or received, so I do not think that we need to fear that the amendment would create a hostage to fortune in the way that some might suggest. Indeed, if that were so, one would have to ask why other regulators established by primary legislation in recent years have been given this kind of directional underpinning. There are good precedents. Ofcom has been mentioned and has an overarching principle duty, and below that a set of specific statutory objectives  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC205"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it is required to secure, such as plurality of providers and the protection of the public. In fulfilling its principle duty, Ofcom must have regard to an array of detailed aims&#151;for example, the desirability of promoting competition, encouraging innovation, taking account of the interests and needs of different people, taking account of the needs of the disabled and of other vulnerable members of society, and furthering the interests of consumers, including the need to have regard to choice and quality. While we may think that Ofcom is a different sort of beast from the Care Quality Commission, it operates to a set of aims and values that are directly analogous, if not identical, to the aims and values set out in the amendment. That should give us confidence.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000042"></a>Sometimes, when regulators are created by statute, certain Acts of Parliament confer a general duty, not just on the regulator, but on the relevant part of the Bill as a whole. The Climate Change Bill does this, as does the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which states in Section 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0804214000051"></a>&#147;The principal aim of this Act is to promote the sustainability of local communities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804214000043"></a>That is the model followed in the amendment, although it takes the precedent of Ofcom and makes the overarching duty more detailed and specific.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000044"></a>The thought that lies behind my Amendment No. 4 is similar; it applies a single principal objective to the commission. It is the same idea that was adopted for the Food Standards Agency. If that formulation were adopted, it would be possible to set out below it a series of detailed aims similar to those in Amendment No. 1 and require the commission to adhere to those aims in the fulfilment of its principal objective.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0804214000045"></a>Clearly there are various ways in which the end result could be achieved. I am not wedded to any one of them in particular, but we need to agree on one formula or another from the many available options.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000001"></a><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042121000082"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I support the first amendment and will speak to Amendment No. 3, to which I have added my name.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000002"></a>What are the objectives of the Bill? Are they to improve regulation or reduce the number of regulators or are they an attempt to improve services or save money? Perhaps there is an element of all those in the Bill, but there was a lot of confusion at Second Reading, when a number of contributors seemed to believe that by putting the Bill together we would improve services per se. That is not necessarily so. It takes a great deal more to do that, as we have seen in relation to local authority services and the difficulties that occur in providing a continuous service in housing benefits and care services. In its present form, the Bill does not do that. However, if we have a set of objectives in the Bill that give a direction and sense of purpose to the commission, that may help the commission to promote and move forward regulation that enhances services. That is what is behind the amendment: promoting those services might move us forward.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000003"></a>I do not want to repeat what has been said, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has covered many of the points that I was going to make about comparisons  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with other organisations. For seven years, I was a member of the Food Standards Agency. Having an overarching principle driving us forward and being independent of government enabled us substantially to change the attitude to food in this country from one of total suspicion to one of acceptance, involvement and understanding. Because social care has many of the same elements, as does healthcare generally, in arousing the suspicion of the general public, we need the same sort of drivers to provide enhancement and promote the public&#146;s understanding of and engagement with those services.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000004"></a>The one point that I want to emphasise&#151;it was an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and others&#151;is the great fear among the consumers of social care services that this will reduce standards in social care and that the health service will devour the currently sparse resources for social care. One has only to look at areas of clinical service in which acute services work alongside community services. Usually it is the acute services that devour the finances and the community services have to make do and mend. As for preventive services, we now have excellent services for the prevention of cancer, with women being screened regularly. However, if you are an old person needing a home help, you have to be in dire circumstances to have any hope of anyone crossing your threshold to assess you, never mind give you a service. There may be a duty to assess but there is no duty to provide the service. That is a very strange anomaly, but there you are. As a clinician, you can be held responsible if you fail to diagnose and treat someone who has crossed your threshold, but the situation is very different in relation to social care, where you can die behind your front door for lack of a service.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000005"></a>I can only repeat a point made by the Relatives and Residents Association, because those are the people whose voices should be heard. The association said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042121000071"></a>&#147;We are concerned that bringing together health and social care under a single regulatory system will mean that the interests of care homes residents and other users of social care services will be marginalised. We are concerned that lack of detail in the Bill&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000064"></a>here it links into the two amendments&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042121000074"></a>&#147;means the new regulatory body, the Care Quality Commission, will be left to determine the details of the regime it will put in place and that social care will be overlooked&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000065"></a>Time and again that concern arises.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000006"></a>Why do I feel so strongly about this? During the passage of a previous Children Bill, when the inspectorate for children was amalgamated with Ofsted, I raised the issue of the need to ensure that children&#146;s services and the focus on children were highly maintained. I am sure that in certain areas that has happened, but I have personal experience of Ofsted-type inspections that do not&#151;as with the Commission for Social Care Inspection&#151;look holistically at the whole situation but have a check-list that gives a score. That does not enhance the atmosphere in which people are cared for. I think that is what we are looking for. Sometimes&#151;Denise Platt has been heard to say this&#151;it does not matter how many rooms you have in a home; what matters is what the atmosphere and the care feel like to the residents.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000007"></a>That leads me to my last point. Unless we have objectives and principles in the Bill and the power to promote those objectives, the voices of those who are in these services will not be properly heard. My experience is both in the delivery of social care and as a recipient, on behalf of some of my service users and myself, of healthcare. One&#146;s voice in and usage of both services are very different. In healthcare I sometimes get to fill in a questionnaire about what it was like&#151;and I might even be asked by my doctor whether I thought that something that had happened to me was good or bad&#151;but in social care there is an attempt to involve the users fully, to hear their voices and to involve them in inspections. This is to ensure that lay people who have experienced the services can tell about it at first hand. Having these principles in the Bill and the power to pursue the objectives will help in that. I support the amendment.</p>

I was also a non-executive member of the Healthcare Commission for several of its first and formative years.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000009"></a>Amendment No. 1 establishes principles which will have important practical consequences. In particular, paragraphs (e) and (f) seek to ensure that the Care Quality Commission maintains a human rights perspective in its general monitoring of health and social care services, and that it does so specifically by protecting and promoting the rights of patients detained under the Mental Health Act or otherwise deprived of their liberty.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000010"></a>I anticipate that a counter argument against the proposal to set out these matters as explicit regulatory objectives is that surely the Care Quality Commission will be a public body and, as such, will be required to operate in accordance with the Human Rights Act, including when exercising the powers given to it for monitoring the use of psychiatric detention, and that adding these regulatory objectives would add little to the existing legal state of affairs were the Bill to pass unamended. However, I would guard against the assumption that public authorities will quietly comply with their Human Rights Act requirements without active monitoring and intervention.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000011"></a>The weakness of such an assumption became apparent to me last week when I was speaking to one of my Mental Health Act Commission commissioners who had just come back from a visit to a secure ward where she had met 11 detained patients. The hospital detaining those patients had a duty to comply with both the Mental Health and Human Rights Acts. It had a duty, for example, to provide detained patients with information about their legal status, including their right to appeal against a decision. Nevertheless, the commissioner felt that at least eight of the 11 detained patients had little or no knowledge about their legal rights. Indeed, two of the patients did not even know that they were detained. Therefore, we cannot assume that services will comply with legal duties just because those duties exist.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000012"></a>As many members of the Committee know, the duty to give information to detained patients has been on the statute book for nearly a quarter of a century, and yet the Mental Health Act Commission frequently finds that it is inadequately met by detaining authorities today. The only way to uncover such inadequacy is by going to the hospitals and meeting the patients directly. As I pointed out at the previous stage of the Bill, my worry is that the Care Quality Commission&#146;s wide and complex task of regulating general health and social care services will leave insufficient emphasis on resources for exercising that methodology. The one most likely to be employed by the Care Quality Commission in its general task will be ill suited to the protection of detained patients. The Minister in another place has stated that he expects the Care Quality Commission to continue the approach of the MHAC in visiting hospitals and meeting detained patients. I welcome the amendment as a means by which the law will ensure that such an expectation is met without being overly prescriptive.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000013"></a>The amendment would also help the Government to fulfil their obligations as a signatory to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture&#151;or OPCAT, as it is known. The Government must sooner or later designate a &#147;national preventive mechanism&#148; of visits to detained patients to prevent their ill treatment. The Care Quality Commission, at least in so far as it takes over the role of the Mental Health Act Commission, will by necessity be a part of this mechanism.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000014"></a>The guidance for establishing national preventive mechanisms recommends that legislation should include a provision that states its purpose and incorporates the language of Article 1 of OPCAT. In particular, it should require that &#147;regular&#148; and &#147;preventive&#148; visiting is undertaken as a part of any monitoring system. The guidance is clear that such preventive visiting must be recognised as different in purpose and methodology from other types of inspection or visit, especially in being proactive rather than reactive. It is designed to stop abuses of patients, not to investigate such abuses after they have occurred.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000015"></a>Let us learn from experience. Fifty years ago, the Royal Commission, under Lord Percy of Newcastle, recommended the abolition of the independent visiting of mental hospitals on the grounds that those hospitals were now a ministerial responsibility and that their inspection should,</p>
<ul><a name="08042121000075"></a>&#147;rest squarely on the shoulders of the Minister&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000066"></a>Then, it was seen to be anachronistic that there should be special arrangements for the inspection of mental hospitals by the Board of Control, which was the direct descendant of the Lunacy Commission, when other hospitals were subject to nothing more than informal visits by officers of the ministry.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000016"></a>After much consultation and correspondence, it was decided that the Board of Control should be abolished. For two decades from the end of the 1950s, no specialist visiting body was concerned with psychiatric detention. Within 10 or so years of that abolition, the first of a number of hospital scandals erupted. In 1969, there was an inquiry into patient abuse in Ely Hospital, Cardiff. After that came similar scandals at Farleigh in 1971, at Whittingham in 1972 and then a number more. Those inquiries provided part of the  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rationale for the re-establishment of the Mental Health Act Commission as a visiting body at the beginning of the 1980s. I know that my noble friend the Minister has no intention of repeating the mistakes of our recent history and that it is the wish of the Government that Mental Health Act Commission-style visits to psychiatric hospitals should continue under the Care Quality Commission. But what will be the situation 10 or 20 years from now?</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000017"></a>For these reasons, I hope that the Minister will support the principle of stating regulatory intentions at the start of the Bill and that he will look sympathetically at other means of ensuring that the Care Quality Commission gives adequate attention to its role in protecting the most vulnerable patients in the health and social care system throughout its existence.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000018"></a><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08042121000084"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> The role of regulators in our society has grown significantly during the past two decades, which has on the whole been helpful and positive. However, being a regulator is not easy. All sorts of questions arise, one of which is what is it that one is supposed to do and regulate. Another is: is one independent? Regulators are by and large appointed by the Government and owe their pay and rations to them, so when a judgment comes out suggesting that someone be criticised, a natural reaction is to say, &#147;It&#146;s the Government&#146;s cat&#146;s paw&#148;, which is often very unfair.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000019"></a>However, it means that, for the job to be done properly, two things are essential, both of which are brought out for further discussion in Amendments Nos. 1 and 14. The first is to know what the job is: one must be sure that those who are regulated know what the objectives and purposes are, that those who are the beneficiaries of the services that are regulated equally know what the purposes of the regulator are, and that Parliament and government know exactly what to expect of regulators. That is the thrust of the first amendment. I support those who want to see more detailed clarification of the purpose and therefore of the objectives of the regulator, thereby avoiding the dangers of having to redesign the legislation in a year&#146;s time. Only thus will we be able to assess whether the job is being done properly. Although it is very unlikely that we will redo this in 18 months&#146; time, the track record suggests that it is not impossible, so it would be good to know the criteria against which how the regulator does the job is assessed.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000020"></a>More specifically, in relation to Amendment No. 14, Clause 2(4) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042121000072"></a>&#147;In performing its functions, the Commission must also have regard to such aspects of government policy as the Secretary of State may direct&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000067"></a>That is ambiguous, loose and potentially dangerous. Even if it is not in fact dangerous, it will be thought to be by those who disagree with what the regulator pronounces at various times. Again, the danger is that the regulator will be thought to be working for political masters rather than with full independence.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000021"></a>I suggest, partly drawing on my experience with Ofsted, that there are at least two separate functions that should reasonably be put before a regulator in taking account of aspects of government policy. One is that a regulator regulates the implementation of that policy. That is perfectly proper; it is what, in part,  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC210"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is there to do. Equally, a regulator must have the capacity to give advice to government if it thinks that policy is not well grounded. Ideally, I should like that advice to be public; with the best regulators, it is. Equally, in Parliament and through ministerial offices, there should be opportunity and encouragement to give independent advice.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000022"></a>That was sorted out in relation to Ofsted by identifying two distinct functions, rather than having a catch-all and ambiguous subsection of this sort. One was the role of the regulator in advising the Government on education policy. These are the people who will see the conditions in detail in GPs&#146; surgeries, hospitals, care homes and the provision of care in the home. They surely will have something to contribute to the correct and proper formulation of policy if it is to be evidence-based. We need to ensure&#151;I do not think that the subsection does so&#151;that there is a natural channel of communication for that advice to be given.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000023"></a>Equally, in the case of Ofsted, certainly in the early days, there was agreement that there would be so many service days, as a service level agreement, available from those who worked with the regulator to the appropriate government department to provide advice on specific points which the Minister might seek from the regulator, rather than reinventing the wheel by using external consultants who may not have the day-to-day, hands-on experience that good regulators will have.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000024"></a>For that reason, it is important that we find resolution on the objectives so that we are clear about the purpose. We should also clarify what I regard as an ambiguity in subsection (4) to ensure that the regulator is not only independent but is seen to be independent.</p>

Also, what will happen if there are not enough available trained people to fulfil the duties?</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000026"></a>My name is attached to Amendment No. 4. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, knows better than most people in this Room how important safety and quality is. He may not know that some places are very substandard. To give an example, last night, I was telephoned to be told that a man with a new spinal lesion had been shunted between four different London hospitals. He was on a waiting list to be admitted to the spinal unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. He has at last been admitted but he has pressure sores and MRSA. In addition, at one of the London hospitals he had a plate put in his spine and it has been found that one of the screws holding it in place was screwed into a damaged vertebra. He now has to have another operation.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000027"></a>Something must be done to achieve high standards throughout the NHS and social care. It is vital that patients go to places where their problems are known and where they can be treated appropriately. I declare an interest as president of the Spinal Injuries Association. Lately, we have been hearing of more and more such cases because there is too much pressure on these specialised units and too many patients, many of whom are older, require treatment there. I hope that something can be done.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000028"></a><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042121000086"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I suspect that this Committee is more or less at the stage where everything has been said but not everyone has as yet got round to saying it, so I shall try to be brief.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000029"></a>I bring to this matter my experience of trying to work with departments in local authorities that have merged and, in the very different field of policing, of trying to produce an integrated service across a range of different policing tasks. There must be clarity of purpose for this new body so that everyone engaged can refer back at regular intervals to what they are there to perform and what they are trying to achieve. The point was very well put that it is also helpful if the users of the ultimate service and those who are regulated are aware of that clarity of purpose.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000030"></a>Similarly, if seamlessness is to be achieved, it is important that those standards and purposes are applied to all the various sectors. That is what motivated me to table Amendments Nos. 12 and 13, although that is not to say that I disagree wholeheartedly with some of the other amendments. The Government need to be aware of the extraordinary strength of feeling that exists that the new regulator requires a clear set of objectives and a clear set of purposes; otherwise, it will not be able to succeed.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000031"></a>Unless the breadth of that responsibility is set out, the danger is that the regulator will in practice start to focus on narrow areas or will move from one area to another, depending on the public pressures that may have arisen in the immediate short term. Returning to the policing comparison&#151;it may not be immediately apparent but there is a very clear comparison&#151;when there are problems of serious or organised crime or terrorism, the police are urged to put all their resources into that area. When the consequence of that is that the rate of so-called low-level crime increases, the police are urged to put their resources into that, and the result is that they move from one extreme to the other. The real danger is that the new regulator will operate in the same way. There will be some appalling scandal in a social care establishment and social care will become the current issue, which may mean that acute care or community services are not looked at in the way that they should be. This should be done holistically, with a clear set of objectives and purposes.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000032"></a>I have heard two sets of arguments as to why amendments along the lines of those that we are considering are not necessary. The first is that everything is here in the Bill but we have not appreciated that Clause 2 covers all the points; the other is that we should not specify matters too much, otherwise, as changes occur and the nature of provision changes, the regulator will be left with a fossilised set of objectives. However, apart from the fact that those are two contrasting and conflicting reasons as to why some change is necessary, the reality is that all these amendments are couched in terms that will enable the new commission to respond to the changes in care patterns that will no doubt arise over the years. If&#151;and it is a big if&#151;the objectives in Clause 2 encompass all the points that we want, it is a very poor example of parliamentary drafting. The objectives and functions of the regulator are set out for other regulatory bodies&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to Ofcom and the Food  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Standards Agency, and we have heard about Ofsted&#151;but a Bill setting up a body with the dreadful name of &#147;Oftenant&#148;, which is shortly to come before your Lordships&#146; House, is a model of clarity for the way in which its regulatory objectives are spelt out. No one needs to be a lawyer; any individual tenant will be able to pick up the objectives and understand the responsibility and focus of the new regulatory body.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000033"></a>I do not know whether there is an A team or a B team in parliamentary drafting, but I suggest that comparisons should be made with the drafting that has been carried out for other regulatory bodies before we come back to this issue on Report.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000034"></a>On the proposal to leave out Clause 2(4), I understand the arguments about independence but there is no point in a regulatory body which does not take some account of the framework of the government policy in which it is operating. It must move within the grain of government policy, but that does not mean that it must always agree with it. It may well be that the words here are not the best form of parliamentary drafting but it would be wrong to omit any reference to government policy. It is important that any regulatory body should make at least some recognition of the governmental environment in which it is operating and tender its advice as a part of that.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000036"></a>I am sure that the Minister and the Government are aware of the great concern among parliamentarians, the current regulators, those working in health and social services and the voluntary groups associated with health and social care which have given us comprehensive briefings. I take the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. There is a concern that if we do not get this right, we shall see health take over the whole agenda of the new commission. For example, if something goes wrong at St Thomas&#146;s Hospital and something goes wrong at &#147;The Laurels&#148; down Acacia Avenue, which is going to get the attention? I am afraid the National Health Service hospital will get the attention. We need to get this absolutely right.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000037"></a>I agree with other noble Lords that if we are to win the confidence of those who are wary of the Bill, we have to instil clarity and certainty. I agree that we need the principles, the underlying philosophy, the purpose, the duties, the mission and, above all, the vision that should underpin the Bill.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000038"></a>Looking wider, other organisations&#151;well-run companies, law firms, universities, NHS trusts, charities and many others&#151;not only articulate their vision and their principles for the benefit of those whom they serve, their customers or their users, but equally they instil in their staff the vision and values that drive them. One hears phrases such as, &#147;These are the things that matter to us&#148;. This is what we believe in; this is what we want to achieve. It is the anchor, it is the clarity, it is the something against which to test the appropriateness of an action, the probity of a decision, the legitimacy of a new policy or innovation. It is necessary to keep the organisation fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000039"></a>I am very impressed by Cancer Research UK, of which I was a trustee for 10 years. It is the largest cancer charity in the world&#151;it raises &#163;1 million every working day&#151;and it has to be very clear about what it is doing, otherwise it will not raise that kind of money. Its vision statement is very simple: &#147;Together we will beat cancer&#148;. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, had as his vision a computer on every desk.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000040"></a>When I was pioneering nurse prescribing, I had to have a vision, which took 20 years to bring about: a prescription pad in every nurse&#146;s hand. Changing Childbirth was much more difficult. After much thought, we decided our vision was that the woman giving birth should have three things: choice, continuity and control. That was adopted as the &#147;three Cs&#148;. I used to go to conferences where people would not even say those words; they would just say, &#147;It&#146;s the three Cs&#148;. The Medical Professionalism project is more difficult still. What is it? Do we care about it? Does it exist? Medical professionalism signifies a set of,</p>
<ul><a name="08042121000076"></a>&#147;values, behaviours and relationships that underpins the trust the public has in doctors&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000041"></a>Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust has a mission statement, which I am sure that the pioneer of minimal invasive surgery can recite in his sleep&#151;although I shall not tempt him this afternoon. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042121000073"></a>&#147;Our mission is to lead the world in improving human health and to be universally recognised as one of the world&#146;s top academic health centres. We will achieve this by providing world-class healthcare for our patients, through excellence in research, education and training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000068"></a>That is clear and to the point.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000042"></a>I am sure the Minister understands what we are trying to get at. We believe that the Bill lacks a clear statement of purpose. There is no clear framework and no criteria by which to judge the effectiveness of a regulator. Members of the Committee have put down eight amendments and more have spoken to those amendments. Many have thought about this issue deeply and have used the words &#147;objectives&#148;, &#147;principles&#148;, &#147;duty&#148; and &#147;functions&#148;. According to the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>, an objective is something that exhibits actual facts,</p>
<ul><a name="08042121000077"></a>&#147;uncoloured by feeling or opinions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000069"></a>I find that a bit difficult. A principle is a &#147;fundamental source&#148;, a &#147;primary element&#148;, a fundamental truth based on reasoning. That is better. </p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000043"></a>I am sure that in replying to this debate, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has said, the Minister will point us to Clause 2, which concerns the commission&#146;s functions, and say, &#147;That&#146;s it. That&#146;s what noble Lords are looking for&#148;. But it is not. Functions are something else, although it is necessary that they are included in the Bill. I am delighted to see in Clause 2(3)(c) the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08042121000078"></a>&#147;the need to ensure that action by the Commission in relation to such activities is proportionate to the risks against which it would afford safeguards and is targeted only where it is needed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042121000070"></a>During the passage of the Bill, those words will be a constant refrain of mine. They underline my thinking that less means more. However, functions are not about vision, principles and duty. The <I>OED</I> describes  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a function as an activity, a mode of action which fulfils its purpose. We are searching for a clear description not of the activity but of the purpose these functions are to fulfil.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000044"></a>My noble friend Lord Howe has used the word &#147;duty&#148;. I like that word. It is defined as a binding force of what is right and a moral or legal obligation. It is what one is bound or ought to do. To me that has clarity; there is no messing about. I believe that, in years gone by, soldiers could be shot for failing to do their duty, although that would be a bit extreme in today&#146;s world. I like the idea that a duty is a binding force of what is right and a moral or legal obligation. I think the noble Lord, Lord Harris, used that in his amendment. I go with Amendment No. 4. It is comprehensive and succinct.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000045"></a>The new clause would give the commission a clear mandate to act on behalf of patients, service users and the public. It would provide them with an explicit assurance that the regulator is acting on their behalf and would enable it to resolve conflicts of interest between stakeholders. It would also clarify what Parliament would like the commission to achieve rather than merely state its functions.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000046"></a>We should not be precious about the wording as the Government are perfectly able to craft their own words, but it needs to encapsulate all that we are trying to achieve. This is not a novel idea&#151;noble Lords have pointed to other organisations, such as the FSA and Ofcom. But I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will be sympathetic to the force of the arguments put not only by those in this House but by those whose concern has been so evident in the many briefings that we have received. I hope that the suggestions on wording are helpful, as they are sincere, and that we see clarity and certainty in the principles and duties that underlie the Bill.</p>

I own up to being the Minister responsible for the policies, although only for six months in the second half of 2006, when I was roped in to try to tackle some of these areas. This is an extremely complicated area and a difficult one; it is not an easy area in which to formulate policy. However, it is with some sadness that I support the main amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000048"></a>We must listen to the volume of concern that has been expressed about the absence of something like these amendments at the beginning of the Bill about the objectives of the regulator. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, said that we do not want to be back here in five years&#146; time. In fact, it was only about five years ago that the noble Earl and I were dealing with these issues in debates on the 2003 legislation. Five years seems to be about the time it takes to come back to this kind of issue.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000049"></a>It is rather sad that we need something of this ilk and that the Bill has been allowed to progress as far as it has without this issue being addressed. It did not need to be like that. When we looked at the policy in 2006, Patricia Hewitt and I made it very clear that we  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needed to look at other regulators. Indeed, we brought in the chairman of Ofcom to help us with the design of some of these issues. He chaired a small group for us to help us identify some of the issues that we had to tackle. Ofcom is a good model of how to set out in legislation what is required of a regulator.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000050"></a>I am sure that my noble friend has his briefing on the strengths of Clause 2. I do not blame him for having that briefing; he was not the Minister responsible for this policy area. But as someone who has been there and got the T-shirt, I gently say to him that Clause 2 does not do the job. It simply does not meet the requirements of a regulator. The three things that you need to do in a framework Bill, if you are to satisfy Parliament and the public, is to be clear about the purpose, functions and scope of a body. The Bill does not yet do that job. There are uncertainties about the scope, which we will come to later; there are definitional problems in Clauses 4 and 5, to which I have put down amendments and which we will debate later. However, those definitions are linked into the objectives to the regulator. We cannot get into that detail until we are clear about the regulator&#146;s purpose.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000051"></a>I am sure that there are probably ways in which the wording of the amendments could be improved. All Members of the Committee have indicated a willingness to be flexible about the precise wording, but something of the kind of what is in the main amendments that we are debating needs to be met.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000052"></a>It is very difficult to argue, as the Government are trying to do, that the devil will always be in the detail of regulation and to say, &#147;Trust us. We just need a framework Bill&#148;. I accept that we were always likely to have a framework Bill, but the question is not whether we have a framework Bill with a lot of detail in secondary legislation&#151;most people would accept that that is inevitable&#151;but whether the framework is adequate. The Bill does not have an adequate framework. I shall not go down the path which my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey mentioned; I think parliamentary draftsmen are wonderful. They are quite capable of producing a wonderful beginning to the Bill, drawing on the amount of expertise that we have enunciated today.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000053"></a>I was quite attracted to Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 in the name of my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey&#151;in typically pithy style, they do a great deal to improve the drafting of the Bill&#151;but we need to go a bit further than that. We need a more detailed statement of objectives of the kind that is put forward in the other amendments. While I do not want to quibble about such drafting, I have a bit of a hang-up about the word &#147;promote&#148;. Regulators are not social marketing organisations; they are not marketing organisations at all. &#147;Encourage&#148; and &#147;support&#148; are fine; but I doubt whether it is the job of regulators to go around promoting anything. I agree with my noble friend Lord Harris that it is fanciful to believe that a regulator can totally ignore the policies of the Government of the day. They cannot be allowed to do that&#151;we may have got the wording wrong. A regulator cannot decide to set up an approach that is totally independent

That is not the job of regulators either.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000054"></a>I have enormous sympathy for the Minister regarding the case he will no doubt be asked to argue. I hope that he will be willing to take away the form of words put forward by people who I think are not overly proud of them and see whether, with all the skills that parliamentary draftsmen can exercise, we cannot come up with something that looks like a more suitable framework for taking forward what everybody accepts is much-needed legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08042121000055"></a><a name="80421-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08042121000089"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> I have two reasons for supporting the thrust of the amendments. First, if we do not have some statement of regulatory objectives in the Bill, we are in danger of setting up a regulator which focuses on the narrow objectives of regulation and inspection. We have in front of us a fine example of the splendid influence of the Commission for Social Care Inspection on the development of social care policy, which I certainly would not want to lose.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000056"></a>My other reason for supporting the amendments is their mention of users, families and carers. Family carers should be recognised in the Bill as key stakeholders in the provision and regulation of health and social care services, with the commission given a duty to consult, involve and generally have regard to carers in its work. I know that Ministers have indicated that that is their intention, but the Bill does not mention carers once, which is a grave omission. The proposed arrangements are not sufficiently strong. Using the catch-all term &#147;the public&#148; does not cover it; we have to have something stronger. As we know, carers play a vital mediation and negotiation role. Their lives are considerably influenced by the quality of care services, and regulation should reflect the fact that patients and carers do not exist in a vacuum, but within families, many of which provide a high level of care. Social care policy is finally recognising that carers should be seen as partners in care, consulted and involved. I recognise and rate the Government for their tremendous work on that, but we need something more in the Bill.</p>

I especially endorse the words of the noble Baronesses, Lady Howarth, Lady Cumberlege and Lady Pitkeathley. I am especially concerned that the status and function of the current social care regulator should not be lost or diluted in any way. All three noble Baronesses have pointed to areas where that is likely to happen. We know that that is likely to happen if we are not very careful.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000058"></a>My other point is that it is only by having a very clear statement of the breadth and range of duties of the new regulator can we ensure that such areas as preventive services are included. We have heard many examples of how they are unobtainable now and becoming more so. I strongly support that point, and the point about carers made by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. I am very pleased to have been part

<p><a name="08042121000060"></a>I declare an interest as a chair of an NHS acute trust which, regrettably, was on the receiving end of an improvement notice late last year. I emphasise&#151;although I am sure that the detail may be upsetting for some people&#151;that we need to ensure that not only the actions taken by the commission referred to in paragraph (c) but the process within which the regulator will be operating is very clear. The big issue for my trust, which is important for all issues around patient care, is that the Healthcare Commission knew exactly what it was serving the improvement notice on, but beyond that, it did not know how to deal with it. It did not have the same rigour in ensuring that a step forward for patient care and understanding was made. I agree with everything said about the robustness of the regulators&#146; understanding needing to be in the Bill, but we must also understand the effect of whatever regulation is implemented.</p>

That is an integral part of our debate on the new commission and it is therefore timely that we are discussing this at the start of our Committee deliberations. Given the nature of our discussion, I intend to focus my remarks on the broader issue of the nature of the commission's objectives and functions.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000062"></a>I want to be clear from the outset that an overarching regulatory objective for the Care Quality Commission, with a clear reference to both social care and healthcare, is something with which I have a great deal of sympathy. It is important that we are able to discuss the best approach to setting any regulatory objectives for the commission in the Bill. The contributions that we have already heard today have been a valuable input into that discussion.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042121000063"></a>As the debate has demonstrated, there are a number of models to draw on as to how such regulatory objectives can be set out in legislation. The aim should be to set out clearly the reasons why the commission is there, and its purpose, and to provide us all with a clear, shared understanding of how to gauge how successful the commission is in carrying out those functions.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000001"></a>The model proposed in Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 mirrors the approach taken in the Legal Services Act 2007 for the Legal Services Board. This would appear  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC218"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be an alternative to the current Clause 2 and be linked to Amendment No. 14, which would remove much of Clause 2.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000002"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, have in Amendment No. 4 suggested, I think eloquently, an overarching principal duty for the commission in carrying out its functions,</p>
<ul><a name="08042127000020"></a>&#147;to protect and promote the interests of people who use health and adult social care services, including their families and carers, in relation to the safety and quality of those services.&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08042127000019"></a>This is along the lines of approaches used for the Food Standards Agency in the Food Standards Act 1999, and for Ofcom in the Communications Act 2003. My noble friend Lord Harris in Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 has proposed a general duty also closely aligned to that set out for Ofcom in the Communications Act.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000003"></a>The Bill draws on yet another of the models raised at Second Reading&#151;that set out for Ofsted in the Education and Inspections Act 2006&#151;on the basis that this was probably the most similar regulator to our new commission. As is becoming apparent, noble Lords will recognise that we have each, in our differing approaches, picked up many repeating themes.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000004"></a>It may be helpful to set out the rationale behind the Government&#146;s approach to the key functions of the Care Quality Commission&#151;those in Clause 2&#151;and then come back to some of the recommendations made by noble Lords. In Clause 2, we have set out those key functions: first, by assuring that health and adult social care services are providing care to the levels of safety and quality&#151;words that we heard many times in this debate&#151;that patients and service users are entitled to expect, and in taking appropriate actions where they are not, through the registration and enforcement provisions in Chapter 2; secondly, by providing comparable information to patients and services users through the reviews proposed in Chapter 3; and, finally, through the vital role currently carried out by the Mental Health Act Commission in monitoring the use of provisions in the Mental Health Act.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000005"></a>Moreover, in Clause 2 we have made it clear that in carrying out its functions, the commission must in everything it does have regard to a number of crucial issues in performing those functions. Noble Lords would agree that it is vital that the commission must have regard to the need to safeguard the rights of children and vulnerable adults when it carries out its functions. The commission must listen to the views of those who use services&#151;patients, service users, carers&#151;including representative bodies such as LINks. The commission must also be required to take account of the Government&#146;s five principles of good regulation, under which regulatory activity should be proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted where needed. In relation to the point raised by several noble Lords on Clause 2(4), I echo what my noble friend Lord Harris has said, but we will of course enjoy a longer debate on this issue when we reach Amendment No. 22. Lastly, Clause 2 makes clear that the commission is to carry out its functions for the general purpose&#151;the regulatory objectives&#151;of encouraging improvements in care service, user-focused care and the efficient and effective use of resources.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000006"></a>Many of those current provisions, some of which would be removed by Amendment No. 14, would be reflected to some degree in the alternative model proposed in Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and supported by other noble Lords. While I am very sympathetic to the issues that the noble Baroness is keen to highlight in these amendments, I have concerns about how prescriptive Amendment No. 1 is, when combined with Amendment No. 3, which would require the commission to act in accordance with these objectives. We all want the new commission to practise what it preaches, but I argue that it forms part of a broader system of other players and other mechanisms. I would not want to detract from the roles and responsibilities of those other players&#151;not least service providers themselves&#151;in delivering, for example, high-quality personalised services.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000007"></a>Although noble Lords no doubt support the good intentions behind these and related amendments, they will recognise that there is a balance to be struck here. Setting too many or too specifically worded objectives may dilute the effectiveness of some or all of them, create unintended inflexibility or create difficulty for the commission in establishing its priorities as circumstances change from time to time. Overall, I would not support regulatory objectives that reached the levels of specificity set out in the model of Amendments Nos. 1 and 3.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000008"></a>Linked to those amendments are Amendments Nos. 101 and 109, which suggest mechanisms for ensuring that the commission reports to both the Secretary of State and the public in its annual reviews on how well it is delivering against those objectives. Indeed, Amendment No. 101 would require the commission to tell the Secretary of State how it has taken the views of patients, users and carers into account in its work and how it and those whom it regulates have contributed to the efficient and effective use of resources. I believe that it is more important for the commission to tell the public directly&#151;hence, we have already set out in Clause 79 the requirement for the commission to report annually on how it has carried out all its functions. Of course, the Care Quality Commission will already keep the Secretary of State informed&#151;for example, through the provisions in Clause 49.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000009"></a>It is worth restating that Clause 2 was crafted very carefully to include all the key responsibilities that we felt this new organisation should have, recognising that the commission will operate as just one part of a broader system. I am therefore unconvinced of the benefit of removing the bulk of provisions in Clause 2 as proposed by Amendment No. 14. However, I recognise that Clause 2 may need to be enhanced to be clearer, and I shall look at this matter again.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000010"></a>As I mentioned, I am sympathetic to the cause of setting a clearer, more easily understood purpose for the new commission, but that purpose must allow the commission some flexibility. I would want to reflect carefully on how this could best be framed, but the thinking proposed by my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey in Amendments Nos. 12 and 13, and by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, in Amendment No. 4 is worth exploring further in conjunction with enhancing Clause 2.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000011"></a>I turn to the point raised by my noble friend Lord Patel regarding the rights of detained patients. At this stage, I express my overall agreement with his intention, but I hope that he understands that I will elaborate further on these issues when we reach the group beginning with Amendment No. 19, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, also asked whether the commission would have any route for advising Ministers. As I said earlier, Clause 49 makes it clear that the commission can advise the Secretary of State on aspects of the provision of care.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000012"></a>In summary, I genuinely believe that we are all working towards similar goals here. We are all using slightly different approaches in setting out the primary objectives and functions of the commission but ultimately we all want patients, service users, carers, those being regulated, the commission and, indeed, us, to have a clear, shared understanding of why the commission is there and of how well it is delivering against the overarching aims. With that in mind, I ask noble Lords to permit me to take away the views expressed today with a view to bringing back on Report a revised, clearer approach to the Care Quality Commission&#146;s overarching regulatory objectives, which your Lordships' House will, I hope, be able to support. I reassure noble Lords&#151;and specifically my noble friend Lord Harris&#151;that I am working with the A team, and I shall make sure that they craft their words as closely as possible to meet noble Lords&#146; aspirations. I therefore hope that noble Lords who have spoken to their amendments will feel able not to press them today.</p>

The forceful point that he made in his reply was about the capacity for the new commission to be able to change its priorities to meet the requirements set for it. I have every sympathy, having been a regulator in four different kinds of services. I understand that point, but what the Minister has not addressed and what I hope he takes away is the real concern that that change of priorities might result in the health service taking over social care and social care being lost in the mire of all the other services&#146; demands, which are huge. I hope that the noble Lord will hear that point, as he has not addressed it in his reply.</p>

I am currently busy carrying out the next stage review. We need to stop looking at healthcare and social care as separate entities and start looking at them through patients&#146; eyes. If we achieve one thing, it should be to break the barriers between the two, as the importance of one cannot be at the expense of the other. I strongly believe that and will take that point back.</p>

<p><a name="08042127000015"></a><a name="80421-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08042127000024"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> This has been a lengthy but immensely valuable debate. In summing up, I begin by saying that those of us who chose to put down amendments did so in the certain knowledge that before the ink is dry on this Bill, when it becomes an Act, there will be major change within the health service. Every one of us knew that, so what we proposed to the Committee  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC221"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>did not fall into the trap of being time-specific or inappropriate. The only certainty in the NHS is that there will be change at an ever-increasing pace.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000016"></a>One of the most helpful contributions was that of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, when she repeated the statement that she made at Second Reading that this Bill is not about improving services but about improving regulation in order to improve services. That is a key point; it summarises the need for the Healthcare Commission to have not only functions but objectives, because those objectives will be realised only by other organisations. It cannot achieve them on its own. That is why I went down the route that I did, rather than the one proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, whereby the duties are put on the commission itself.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000017"></a>It is important that those objectives are explicit and are there for all to see. That includes providers who, as the Minister said, have to share those objectives, too. I disagree with him about there being too many objectives and that they are too tightly worded, but then I would.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042127000018"></a>It was useful to listen to the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, about the role of regulators and the key point about regulators providing advice to government. He will, I hope, understand that from where we started with the Bill, getting the duty to provide advice to government seemed a step too far to begin with. Nevertheless, he is absolutely right.</p>
<h5><a name="08042133000068"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000001"></a>I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, about choice being wholly and utterly dependent on resources. If we had gone into that territory, we should simply have proposed a paragraph asking the regulator to perform miracles. It just cannot do that, but it can work with providers to extend the practice of choice within existing budgets.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000002"></a>That picks up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. He is absolutely right to say that no regulator can function wholly outwith the scope of government policy. That is why the list of objectives is as it is. Some of us happen to think that promotion of choice in the health service is a bit ambitious, but it is the stated policy of all the major parties at the moment. There is a difference between the rational expectation that any regulator will work within the framework of government policy and laying it open to being dictated to by the Secretary of State&#151;precisely for the reason that the noble Lord gave. We are talking here about such an immense field that it must be tempting for any Secretary of State to move the regulator's work from one area to another to suit political fashion. I hope that we can pick up on that point.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000003"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked what happens when regulators get it wrong. The answer is: look at what happened to the Financial Services Authority. However, that reinforces the point that we need to ensure that there is independence.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000004"></a>I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. I do not think that we are just talking about functions; I think that we are talking about objectives, but I warmly welcome his response. He will be as aware as the rest of us of the extensive concern expressed by all parts of the lobby about the absence of such provision, but I

Unfortunately, I have a social function for which I have to leave at 5.30 pm and which people are travelling many hundreds of miles to attend. I am obviously in the hands of the Committee.

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000010"></a>I will briefly repeat the point that I made at Second Reading. I make no bones about it: I should like the Bill come into force in 3013 or 4013, not 2013. I am aware that CSCI, which has given us all such good briefings on this, has called the Bill premature. On that basis, it seems more sensible to aim to postpone its introduction for further consideration than to suggest that this bit of it, at any rate, should not happen at all.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000011"></a>Since 2002, we have had a reorganisation of the regulation of social care&#151;probably a justified one. We have also had a re-reorganisation of social care. Now, within five years of starting that process, we are presented with a proposal for a re-re-reorganisation. I do not want to go over all the ground about the cost of reorganisation, although I shall refer to one element in it that was beautifully set out by Sir Ian Kennedy in his speech on the subject that many noble Lords will have read. He is in an even better position than those of us around this table to know about those costs.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000012"></a>This to me is a reorganisation of a reorganisation of reorganisation&#151;re-re-reorganisation run amok. We should leave it longer before deciding that the present system cannot be made to work. The objectives of getting social care, mental healthcare and healthcare to work together can be achieved in many ways short of this proposal. I speak as a veteran of the Government&#146;s attempts to get health and social care to work better together in other aspects since the days of the royal commission on which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and I sat. That is my first point.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000013"></a>My second point&#151;if one is allowed to make a non-partisan political point in this House&#151;is as follows. Let us suppose that the Bill goes through as drafted and let us suppose&#151;heaven forfend&#151;that there is terrible problem, which I imagine would be most likely to happen in a home for the elderly, although it could happen in a mental healthcare home, or, indeed, in the NHS. Let us also suppose that there is a plausible case to be made at that time that the reason that the regulator&#146;s eye was not on the ball was that it was busy re-re-reorganising. Usually, accountability in this area is pretty clear. It is the regulator who is responsible for regulating, but in the circumstances that I have described, what is the regulator going to say&#151;truthfully or not? It will say, &#147;Not my fault. It&#146;s the Minister&#146;s fault. If we had not been busy re-re-reorganising, this would not have happened&#148;. In such situations, it is possible to imagine&#151;heaven forfend&#151;that at the extreme people will have died as a result.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000014"></a>I always appeal to Ministers on grounds of principle, but Ministers collectively should think also of self-preservation in this case. It would be a disaster if what I described happened. They would not be able to say that they had not been warned, because they have been warned in both Houses. Ministers should at least pause to consider&#151;although I do not ask for a decision this afternoon&#151;whether this is truly a wise risk to run at this time. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08042133000015"></a><a name="80421-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08042133000074"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I apologise that I was unable to take part at Second Reading but I strongly support the amendment, because it reminds me very much of my immediate reaction when I heard of the Chancellor&#146;s intention to merge 11 inspectorates into three. It reminds me of a very short regulation that I once found on a military wall, which stated, &#147;A breach of common sense is a breach of the rules&#148;.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000016"></a>When we discussed the merger of the inspectorates of police, probation, prisons and courts into something called the Inspectorate for Justice, Community Safety and Custody, I reminded your Lordships that the proposal was not a good idea because it was a confusion of three separate functions, all of which are required in public sector bodies, all of which are carried out differently and all of which, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said, have different scopes, functions and purposes. Those functions are regulation, audit and inspection. What concerns me is that this proposal repeats exactly the same mistakes as were made in that previous proposal, because it confuses the three separate functions. Indeed, I noticed that in his closing speech at Second Reading the Minister described the proposed new body as being both a regulator and an inspectorate. It cannot be both. Having been an inspector, I know what would be involved&#151;I had to be a regulator as well&#151;and I certainly did not carry out inspection as an audit, because that would have been entirely unclear.</p>

<p><a name="08042133000017"></a>What also worries me about this is what has been hinted at by my noble friend Lady Howarth: the submergence of social care, in this case under health, which is the major player in this proposal. In the same way, I am extremely concerned at what has happened to CSCI, which has been split in two. Half is going under education, as the noble Baroness mentioned,  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC224"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and is in danger of being submerged there under the style of an inspection or audit carried out by Ofsted, while the elderly will remain with the Department of Health together with mental health, which is yet another different function. The loser in all this is social care&#151;the care of children and the elderly, both of whom have mental health needs quite apart from any other needs.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000018"></a>I am meant to be in the Chamber now discussing something to do with young people in care. Until the reorganisation before the re-reorganisation, they were part of an organisation that was designed to look at care holistically, but quite deliberately the Government are breaking that up. This is desperately unwise. That is not to say that it is not a good thing to bring mental healthcare, healthcare and social care closer together in the care of the elderly, but that does not need a merger. The situation that will inevitably arise if you bring three specialist organisations together is that each of them will be weakened by trying to compromise. That lesson is learnt over and again. It is the lesson in IT, for example: big systems crash when you try to amalgamate them. Distributed databases with their own strengths that can be interrogated and can work together are the best way to proceed. The classic example, which we debated in this House only last year, was the very good report on safeguarding children that was led by CSCI. It did not organise everyone but had experts from all the other inspectorates coming together and working for a common purpose.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000019"></a>The amendment is absolutely right. It says, &#147;Hang on. Halt. Throughout Second Reading CSCI was praised almost universally for what it was doing&#151;for the standards it was setting, the paths it was treading and the pioneering it was doing. It hasn&#146;t yet delivered what it was given to do and now you&#146;re breaking it up&#148;. I hope that the Minister, in the same spirit in which he has taken away the previous amendment to look at the question of the purposes and principles, will do the same with this one, as I do not believe that the regulatory impact assessment is a full and proper assessment of all the implications of what is proposed. I hope that in doing so the Government will consider what is being done to social care as a whole by splitting it in two and dividing its expertise, when expertise is crucial in all aspects of social care.</p>

Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, gave me advance warning that he might have to duck out of the debate prematurely and he asked me whether I would listen carefully to what the Minister had to say and respond afterwards.

<p><a name="08042133000021"></a>As I suspect is the case with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, who has just spoken, I am against this merger, as I made clear at Second Reading. I do not think that a merger of these commissions makes very much sense and most of the arguments suggest that it should not proceed. For example, bringing services together does not necessarily mean that you should  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC225"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bring the regulators together. As has often been said, the sectors being regulated are very different and different models of regulation from one to the other may well be appropriate. The merger will be very costly and the savings looked for have largely been made already&#151;fully by the Healthcare Commission, and CSCI is well on the way to achieving the savings that the Treasury has asked of it. The arguments that have often been deployed suggest that we should not go ahead with the merger. No doubt these arguments will feature again as the Committee goes further through the Bill.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000022"></a>However, at the moment we are talking about postponing the merger and I shall confine myself to considerations that suggest it should be delayed, which is what the amendment seeks. Both CSCI and the Healthcare Commission say that from their point of view the merger is premature. If that is the case and that point is taken, the very least one should seek to do is to delay the implementation of the merger, which has all kinds of undesirable features.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000023"></a>I would deploy three arguments for a postponement of the kind sought by the amendment. First, as has been pointed out by other noble Lords, this is the third shake-up of social care inspection since 2002. Inevitably this will be disruptive and undermine continuity in the regulation of these sectors. As Sir Ian Kennedy said in the statement that he issued to the Public Bill Committee in another place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042133000065"></a>&#147;We will see a period of flux. Senior staff will need to be recruited and then appoint others. Managers will be organising awaydays and be locked in meetings over organisational design and conditions of employment instead of meeting the accelerating demands and expectation of patients. Morale in existing organisations will be increasingly hard to sustain. Good members of staff are already leaving, taking with them knowledge that it has taken three years to develop. This huge distraction from the central mission of the regulator to encourage improvement in care, with particular emphasis on quality and safety, is likely to continue for some time. Academic research on structural reform and our own experience in establishing the Healthcare Commission suggest that it will take at least two years for the new organisation to become operationally effective. This loss of momentum will be even more exacerbated if the new organisation, for reasons which are understandable, decides to return to first principles in designing its regulatory approach&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042133000060"></a>Someone else described returning to first principles as reinventing the wheel.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000024"></a>All that sits uncomfortably, says Sir Ian, with an urgent desire for stronger regulation and safer healthcare, as expressed in a number of speeches by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Health. It seems more likely that the policy will, at a critical moment, set back the development of the culture of safety.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000025"></a>My second reason for seeking a postponement is that other models to achieve the desirable end of bringing together the regulation of health and social care while avoiding the cost and distraction of new legislation have been advanced but have not been adequately explored. For example, the health and social care sectors are significantly different, so different models of regulation may very well remain appropriate, despite the new legislation. None of that seems to me to have been gone into adequately.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC226"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000026"></a>At Second Reading, I referred to the National Audit Office guidance on mergers of public sector bodies. I then asked the Minister whether any of the injunctions which the National Audit Office has given to those undertaking such mergers have been complied with in promoting such measures. For instance, have the Government followed the recommendations of the National Audit Office when considering the merger of regulators? Have they undertaken due diligence, cost-benefit or risk analysis, and have they established measurable success criteria for the merger? It would be very reassuring to have the Minister's assurance on those points.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000027"></a>Finally, in February 2005, a Department of Health review concluded that the health and social care inspectorate fledgling organisations needed time to establish themselves independently. Indeed, the review of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is proceeding at the moment. It seems that every other health reform except this one has been put on hold pending the conclusion of his review. Why the exception in this case?</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000028"></a>In summary, merger at this time will be very disruptive when the current inspection regimes are still bedding in. They need more time to establish themselves.</p>

So I have padded it out a little&#151;just to make sure that noble Lords get their money&#146;s worth&#151;by reaching for another quotation from Sir Ian, which strikes me as very relevant to this debate and certainly to the merger of the commissions. In his statement to the Public Bill Committee in another place, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042133000066"></a>&#147;In conclusion, the reasons for the Bill&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042133000061"></a>one might say the merger&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042133000067"></a>&#147;are unclear. The costs are high. The distraction is very considerable. The risk of harm to patients is significant ... We believe that the committee should seek to be satisfied that each of these matters has been properly taken account of and that the concerns expressed here are unwarranted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042133000062"></a>The same question might well be addressed to Ministers: are they satisfied that each of these concerns has been properly taken account of, and that the concerns expressed here are unwarranted? I do not believe that they are unwarranted. The existing commissions need more time to complete their work to establish a continuity of service that in due course can be carried into the new merged commission at a more appropriate time and in a way that permits a smoother transition than this merger, which promises to be very rushed, will bring about.</p>

I support the amendment somewhat despondently, because I do not think it has any hope of success. I feel I need to place on record my serious concerns about where this will take us. Much of what the noble Lord, Lord Low, has quoted from Sir Ian Kennedy illustrates those concerns.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000035"></a>As I said at Second Reading, I was the deputy chair of the National Care Standards Commission. We read, when it was leaked to the <I>Times</I>, that we were to be abolished, and then heard a few weeks later that we were indeed to be abolished and changed. That was before the commission had had the opportunity to put on the ground the services that needed to be put in place to develop good regulation. We managed to do a reasonable job in the following two years, but hoped that the Commission for Social Care Inspection would be able to pick up the baton and develop the commission, which I believe it has done. As that commission itself would say, however, it is in no way yet in a settled position. The commission holds the view that structural change in the regulation of social care and healthcare at this time is premature. It is about timing.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000036"></a>I do not believe that anyone thinks there is no value in looking at this issue carefully and in detail for the future, and I would be delighted to be involved in redesigning services that gave continuity of care to people on the ground. Indeed, I have been trying to look at that in social housing, but trying to get Ministers to understand what the problems are in the spectrum of social housing linked to benefits is extraordinary. The same sort of problems occur in social care, but regulation is not the way to put that right. That is why I keep coming back to the purpose of the Bill, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and, I believe, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000037"></a>I would feel more respect for the Government&#146;s position&#151;for which I do not hold the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, responsible, although he is probably very loyal to his position&#151;if they were to say, &#147;We have to reduce the number of regulators to save money and this is the way we&#146;re going to do it&#148;. That would show that they were doing it, irrespective of the quality. However, to call the new body the Care Quality Commission has all sorts of issues around it.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000038"></a>The second reason why I feel despondent is that I have been involved in the development of the first commission; I originally worked in a children&#146;s department that was then merged into a social services department to become a &#147;holistic&#148; service; I saw reorganisations in different ways in social services about 14 times in 14 years; and I recently had the experience of sorting out CAFCASS, an organisation where, again, a merger was not thought through with regard to services being taken in from the local authority. If the Government are really set on this course under this timescale&#151;and I can see they probably are, although under the amendment it could not be the same timescale&#151;I can only ask them to understand the implications of the merger on the users and providers of services who will find themselves picking up the pieces and, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said, spending far more time in meetings contemplating issues around computers, forms and service delivery than in getting resources to the  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>front line&#151;as we have been doing in CAFCASS in the past few years&#151;so that the users of the service benefit from the resources in the system. That is all I have to add. I support the amendment simply because it would give us more time to look at these issues.</p>

So far there have been only three contributions to the debate but I am still searching for any real reason to support it, other than perhaps saying, if it is not disingenuous of me to do so, that we should not do it at all.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000040"></a>The acute services are now working more closely with social services and the Government&#146;s policy around health and social care is being drawn together. People like me and the staff with whom I work are very keen for the Healthcare Commission to follow best practice in other regulatory bodies associated with the type of care we are delivering.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000041"></a>As someone who has worked through lots of mergers and organisational changes&#151;although not in a regulatory body&#151;I can say that there is never a good time for this to happen. My noble friend Lord Lipsey referred to &#147;this crucial moment&#148;. I have been involved as the chair of a health trust for only two and a half years but I have yet to see a time when this is not crucial. As someone said, the crucial issue here is the improvement of care for patients. I believe we should go ahead with this as soon as we feel it is safe, an issue on which we spent a great deal of time previously. For all the reasons we discussed in the previous amendment, we must make sure that we do this in the best possible way.</p>

<p><a name="08042133000042"></a><a name="80421-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="08042133000082"></a>Earl Howe:</b> With the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has taken us to the heart of an issue which was never far below the surface of our debates at Second Reading&#151;the issue of timing. I believe, as does my party, that there are sound practical and policy reasons for wanting to bring the regulation of health and social care closer together and that a combined regulator makes sense as a matter of principle. I can see that not all noble Lords are necessarily signed up to the principle but, if the principle is accepted, the next question has to be about the practicalities. It is on that issue that we have not yet had a convincing set of answers from the Government.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000043"></a>The purpose of having a regulator of health and social care is, above all, to protect patients and service users from harm. There are all kinds of other good and worthy reasons but it is as quality watchdogs that the Healthcare Commission and CSCI ultimately justify their existence. Abolishing two regulators that are already up and running and creating a new regulator in their place is inevitably a recipe for disruption in the way that services are monitored. You can plan to implement the new set-up in the smoothest way imaginable, but with staff recruitment, organisational design and general setting up, some hiatus between one regime and the next is unavoidable. With that hiatus comes an enhanced risk to patients and service users because managers and employees, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, rightly said, will have their minds on matters other than their core tasks. That is the dilemma faced by Ministers in rolling out the policy they have embarked upon. Or at least it should have  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, I am not aware that the practical implications of accomplishing this merger have ever assumed much salience in ministerial in-trays, and certainly not in ministerial public pronouncements.</p>
<h5><a name="08042133000070"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000044"></a>Any sensible person must agree that the merger needs to be carried out in a way that is least risky and least disruptive to those concerned. Fixing next April as the date when the CQC begins its operational life presents, in my opinion, a hugely ambitious timescale and a hugely risky one. If you talk to the Healthcare Commission and CSCI, they will both tell you the same thing&#151;that they are young organisations and that it is only now that the new systems of regulation that they have put in place are beginning to bite and have real effect. Both bodies have restructured themselves and have made substantial budgetary savings in the process. CSCI is even now in the middle of further rationalisation involving staff cuts and closure of offices, quite independently of the coming merger.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000045"></a>CSCI has modernised its way of working and put in place an estates and IT strategy fit to carry it into the future. Of course, that restructuring has not been without pain; staff numbers will be 38 per cent lower in March 2009 than they were two years ago. So it is not surprising that the prospect of making significant financial savings, which is one of the supposed benefits of merging the two regulators, is hardly now a factor, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said. CSCI has identified a merger dividend of only &#163;5.25 million a year, which, set against the estimated costs of the merger&#151;about &#163;140 million&#151;is not large.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000046"></a>Another reason for the merger cited by Ministers is the need to have a regulator with stronger powers. If you talk to the Healthcare Commission or CSCI, neither of them would say that they need stronger powers. What they need is to be able to maintain the momentum that they have so successfully generated. That prospect is apparently to be denied them. For a period of two years, we will lose the benefit of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s work on areas such as maternity services, the care of those with learning disabilities and infection control&#151;to cite the examples given by Sir Ian Kennedy. We have heard much of what Sir Ian said already, but in giving evidence in another place he went so far as to say that the rationale of the Bill remained &#147;at best unclear&#148;. Coming from him, that statement should set alarm bells ringing.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000047"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, were to press me, I would have to express some hesitation about going quite as far as his amendment goes in postponing implementation by four years. He perhaps needs to go a little further to demonstrate why four years would be an appropriate delay. However, I might well join him on Report if he proposed a slightly shorter delay&#151;a period sufficient for both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI to work together more closely than they do at the moment and sufficient for them to be confident of handing over their respective going concerns in a shape that could be taken forward more coherently than they can now. This is one of the most important questions that we will need to decide, and I only hope that the Minister is in listening mode.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Low, on his behalf. I thought that he deployed some telling arguments&#151;but then I would, because they are arguments that I have deployed at least twice before, and I think that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has, too, as we sat through various bits of legislation setting up different health and social care legislators. Having said that, I think that I am in the happy position of being able to anticipate a lot of what the Minister will say to us in response.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000049"></a>The arguments about the merger could be made at any time. There will never be a time when there is no change going on in the world of health and social care, so why do I think that those arguments are particularly strong now? I have two reasons. First, I share a feeling with the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, who has now twice expressed her impatience for change. When she does so, my immediate reaction is, &#147;Yes, but you are representing the acute healthcare sector&#148;. I am sorry but, as someone who comes from the social care sector, that is how I feel and I am one of thousands of people who feel the same. People in social care are fearful that the lack of parity between acute healthcare and social care has not yet been sufficiently addressed. I am sorry to come back to it but that is the reality on the ground.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000050"></a>The more telling arguments are not the ones that have already been made about the organisational change for the regulators, but those that say that what the regulator is to regulate is going through a period of unprecedented change. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is about to publish his review. I am sure that he will tell us that what the healthcare regulator has to do will not change substantially. That may be so, but immense change is taking place in social care. I shall mention just three things. The first is the implementation of the 2010 procurement directive, which will bring about a necessity for competition in all areas of public funding. That is why even money spent on what is known as Part B, relating to health and social care services, which so far have been exempt, will be open to increasing competition by 2010. If noble Lords care to look, they will find more and more tenders for all sorts of forms of social care. That is having a dramatic effect on providers and that will increasingly be the case for the next two years.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000051"></a>The second major area is the extension of individual budgets and self-directed care, which will bring about a massive change in everything to do with care planning and the care workforce. Increasingly, social care will be delivered by informal carers who have been chosen by people given a budget with which to secure their care. Those carers will not have to be registered in any way. That is a massive change. I honestly think that the Government have underestimated the extent and pace of change in social care.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is not present, but I think that he was quite canny. In the light of those three changes on their own, never mind anything else, I think that it will be early 2013 before we begin to see anything like a settling down of provision. For that reason, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has gone further to the heart of all this than perhaps even he recognised.</p>

<p><a name="08042133000055"></a>Amendment No. 2, as it is written, would delay the Care Quality Commission&#146;s operational start for more than four years. It does not debate whether or not we should have the merger. I have listened carefully to my noble friend&#146;s concerns that the creation of the new regulator is seen as one of a long line of changes. It might be helpful if I talked through the rationale behind those changes.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000056"></a>As the Committee knows, we introduced independent assessment of the NHS back in 1999 by creating the Commission for Health Improvement to support the drive to improve quality in the NHS. Although it did that well, it was felt to duplicate or even overlap with aspects of the Audit Commission&#146;s work and, later, the National Care Standards Commission&#146;s regulation of independent healthcare providers. As a result, in 2004&#151;and this brings me to my noble friend&#146;s word &#147;re-reorganisation&#148;&#151;we created the Healthcare Commission, which enabled more sophisticated assessment of NHS providers and more independent information for patients in the annual health check, as it has been known so far. At that time, however, regulation of the NHS was still new and needed time to bed in, whereas the regulation of social care and independent healthcare was already well established.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000057"></a>Improvements since then, such as the better integration of health and adult social care services and, as we have heard today, more choice for patients and service users, mean that the time is now right to bring the regulatory frameworks together for the benefit of those who use the services. We believe that the common framework will remove artificial barriers between the health and social care systems&#151;that is certainly challenging my review at the moment&#151;and will further encourage joint commissioning of health and social care services. Having one single regulator will be simpler for the public too, especially where people are using services from both systems, as is increasingly the case. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has eloquently described some of the future challenges in social care and some of the long-term conditions.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000058"></a>I strongly believe that the sum of the two commissions is greater than its parts, which is the debate that we have been having today. There is reasonable evidence out there that more integration is better for patients, and a more integrated regulator will probably enhance the quality of integrated service provision. As we will address in detail in response to later amendments on the subject, there are also significant benefits to be gained from bringing the monitoring of functions  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC232"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under the Mental Health Act into a single organisation with health and social care regulation. These include stronger penalties and the fact that the commission will also now be able to take action to intervene where people who may not be subject to compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act are not being cared for appropriately.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042133000059"></a>Given those benefits, let me offer some reassurance about the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Lipsey. We do not intend to implement the full registration system until April 2010, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to establish the new system and for providers and commissioners to familiarise themselves with it. We will not be reinventing the wheel, either. Providers of social care and of private and voluntary health care have been subject to registration for a number of years, and they do it remarkably well. Both the department, in the development of secondary legislation, and the new commission, in developing the criteria, will build on the expertise of the existing commissions and the experience of the social care and private and voluntary healthcare sectors. The system should, and will, build on the Care Standards Act 2000 model to extend to all providers, including the NHS. As part of the transition to the new commission, we are working closely with the existing bodies to ensure business and human resources continuity.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000002"></a>Let me address some of the other issues raised. The first is the eloquent contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Low, concerning the quote from Sir Ian Kennedy, who is a colleague for whom I have had tremendous admiration for what he has achieved to date with the Healthcare Commission. At the same time&#151;probably in the same evidence-giving session on 8 January&#151;we heard from Councillor David Rogers of the Local Government Association, who stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042138000104"></a>&#147;Organisational change always causes some short-term disruption and some loss of focus for a short period. If any change is to be made, everything must be attempted to try to minimise that, but I think the long-term benefits outweigh it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042138000099"></a>It is strongly emphasised that, as we are going through this change, we need to make it as constructive as possible. That was acknowledged by my noble friend Lady Wall.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000003"></a>Earlier, the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, made a point about the Imperial College NHS Trust, an organisation that I have worked in, which has just been through a merger of three separate organisations: two major NHS providers and a university. Ten years ago, you would have said that they were chalk and cheese. That organisation had to merge as quickly as possible in order to have the least disruption to its mission. Those who work in those organisations strongly believe that the sum of the parts is greater than the value of each of them.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, also asked whether the Government have followed the National Audit Office guidance. The implementation team is fully versed in the study being carried out by the National Audit Office following the merger of various bodies to form Ofcom, and we are using it to inform work to establish the Care Quality Commission. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also raised the issue of inspection and  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC233"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>audit. Inspection is embedded in health and social care regulation. The current regulators, whether the Healthcare Commission or CSCI, both audit and carry out inspections.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000005"></a>Some noble Lords, to whom I am very grateful, were also concerned about how establishing the new regulator would fit within the next stage review. I should like to make clear that the review will not lead to changes in the organisational structure of the NHS&#151;I made that commitment in the interim report&#151;but is there to build on reform so far and focuses on what should be the purpose of reform over the next decade: quality and safety, two words that we have used regularly today. The regulatory framework in the Bill is designed to be sufficiently flexible to allow that to happen, and I very much hope that the next stage review will be the vehicle by which we can address some of the concerns raised today.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000006"></a>Given all the hard work and preparation that has already been done for the new commission, a delay could lead to confusion and an inevitable loss of momentum. It would greatly extend the period of uncertainty for the current commissioners&#146; staff. Delaying the implementation of the provision would also defer implementation of the enhancement to the function of monitoring of the Mental Health Act achieved by Schedule 3.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000007"></a>The long-term benefits of the provision far outweigh the damage that a delay could cause at this stage. I hope that I have provided the Committee with enough reassurance that this is really the right time for my noble friend to feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000008"></a><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042138000123"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> In Committee it is open to any noble Lord to make a contribution at any stage&#151;I make that point for the benefit of all noble Lords. I listened closely to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and I wonder if he could deal with two points. I spoke about the huge change that is going on which is due to come into effect in the next two to three years in terms of provision. He said that the structure of the NHS will not change as a result of his review. I understand that, but is it not his intention that a great many more services will be provided by the ambulance service, for example, and by GPs, who are critical to the NHS and who are in a community setting? It is not clear whether they are to be brought under the scope of this Bill. Although he does not intend to change the structure of the NHS, what happens where and who delivers services will change enormously.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000009"></a>The noble Lord mentioned, rightly, that the Government want continuity that builds on all the good work of the existing regulators. He mentioned the Care Standards Act. That piece of legislation that I know and love well&#151;I sat through hours of debate during its passage&#151;was designed for a time when the majority of care services were provided en bloc by public authorities. For example, a great deal of the Act relates to the provision of residential care by public authorities. My point is that, for the foreseeable future, the nature of social care services will change dramatically. Residential care services may well continue, but there will be a massive change in how they are managed, as opposed to commissioned, by individual users. That is

I remain unconvinced and still have a number of queries that I hope that the Minister might be able to take on board.</p>

Medicine is a very exciting field. Health and social care is an extremely exciting field, and change occurs not just daily, but weekly, monthly and yearly. I am sure she will agree that we need a provision that keeps up the momentum of that change. At the same time, if you have providers that maintain change and innovation, we need a regulator that maintains change and innovation. The example that we discussed is more care being delivered from the community, whether that is in a primary community setting or in social care and integrated services. That is something close to me. Many noble Lords will have heard that I do not believe that provision in a hospital setting is the future in meeting some of the challenges facing us in health and social care, given the ageing population, long-term conditions, the success of technology and the conversion of acute illnesses into chronic long-term conditions. We need robust systems out there in health and social care to deal with this integrated model, and the combined regulator is one of the enablers in allowing that to happen, rather than being an obstacle.</p>

In response, I would make two points. I do not believe, and I see absolutely no evidence, that either the Healthcare Commission or CSCI have in any way held up those innovations. I would say the reverse: that CSCI has very much been to the fore in terms of driving them. So I am not sure that that argument stands. My point is that, as the delivery-commissioning management of services increasingly moves towards individual users, the task of regulation becomes completely different from the regulation of large public authorities. It is not necessarily wrong of noble Lords to ask for more time for regulatory systems and processes to be developed to take on board that substantial change.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000013"></a>In her contribution, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has made the argument for us going ahead and doing this. She rightly suggested that I am speaking on behalf of an acute trust&#151;primarily, I am&#151;but it is an acute trust that is now into a phase of reconfiguration of services led by the Government&#146;s community view of services being delivered nearer to home. As a result, the discussion that is going on between us and the commissioners, whether they are the PCT, the GPs or independent commissioners, gives us a view that is wider than dealing with what happens inside a hospital. That is the way forward. When I make comments in opposition to the amendment, I do so on the basis that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC235"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the wider the service goes, the more important it is that the regulator embraces all those services. That is why we are anxious that this should go ahead when it is scheduled to. The very reason why the changes are happening means that there is a time when they should happen, and the schedule reflects that.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000014"></a>People want a regulator that looks at what happens in the hospital, but as less and less goes on inside hospitals and more goes on in the community, the regulator should look across all of that. That is why I and the people I have had discussions with&#151;not just from the acute trust but with PCTs and other commissioners and providers&#151;suggest that the sooner we get on with this, the better.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000015"></a><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042138000127"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I do not for a moment doubt the noble Baroness&#146;s sincerity nor her motivation in wanting the merger to happen, but perhaps she will understand the concern that some of us have that what happens in the community is not extended healthcare; it is social care. That is the sort of argument we wish to have, particularly when much of what will happen in the community in future may well come under the auspices of an acute trust, but that may well be up against services that are being commissioned by individual social care users. Those are much lower level services, not medical-based services in any way.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000016"></a>I feel that I have prolonged my argument, but I remain unconvinced. I look forward to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, taking the baton up again.</p>

When he left, the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, seemed to be in a charitable mood, so I am sure he would want to withdraw the amendment. However, this is an issue about which we may still have more to say. I am glad that the issues have been canvassed, and it is right that we take them away and return to them another day. There is unfinished business here with these two commissions. As has been said, there will always be unfinished business, but it would be beneficial if the commissions were given time to finish their work a little more tidily than they will be able to if the Bill&#146;s provisions go through.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000018"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, that I tried carefully to distinguish between arguments against the merger in principle and the arguments for delaying it somewhat. The case I made was not just a case for scuppering the merger in disguise. I continue to think that there are valid arguments for giving this a little more time. I am not sure that the merger has been fully thought through yet; I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurance that the National Audit Office guidelines have been looked at, but I am not sure that all the alternative models have been fully explored.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000019"></a>There is also the question of disruption. As with unfinished business, there will always be disruption, but the case that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and I, as well as others who have spoken&#151;including the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, I think&#151;would make is that more time would enable a smoother transition and make it possible to minimise the disruption&#151;a degree of which is, I concede, inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000020"></a>Just as we will take the issues back and reflect on what has been said, so might the Minister be glad if he gave the matter a little more consideration. I think back to the ill-starred Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, which we finally put to rest a year ago in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act. Its death sentence was passed several years previously, but it had to have a stay of execution because the administrative arrangements for handing over to successor bodies had not been put in place. I think that there were six stays of execution. I wonder whether the Minister might care to reflect on that and on whether, in due time, wiser counsels might prevail. He might come to the conclusion that, by lengthening slightly the transition period, he might be saved from having to make an embarrassing retreat on the timescale of implementation.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000021"></a>We will certainly wish to return to this matter. Just as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, was in charitable mood in authorising me to withdraw the amendment, so might he have been in slightly expansive mood, perhaps in view of his approaching 60th birthday, in drafting the amendment. I concede to the noble Earl, Lord Howe that four years might be a little too long. I venture to think that there might be a meeting ground for all of us somewhere between the one year that is provided for in the Bill and the four years proposed by the amendment. On behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000026"></a>The noble Earl said: A consistent theme of our Second Reading debate, reprised several times today, was the fear that one area of the commission&#146;s regulatory activities would assume an undue ascendancy over one or both of the others. In particular, the fear was that social care matters could in certain circumstances become the poor relation to healthcare within the commission&#146;s programme of work. The underlying thought here is that the commission will be an organisation whose success in the public mind will be judged largely by reference to those areas of its remit which tend to assume a high public profile&#151;in other words, health&#151;and that, almost inevitably, resources will be sucked into that area of its work at the expense of others.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000027"></a>There are various ways in which one could set about forestalling that possibility in the Bill. We will shortly debate an amendment designed to ensure that adult social care is properly represented on the board of commissioners. I happen to have great sympathy with that idea, not least because it is common sense. Later, we will debate an amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, which would create sub-commissions within the commission&#151;one for health and mental health and the other for social care. I can see where the noble Lord is coming from in that amendment, although I am not sure that I shall be able to support him, as setting up sub-commissions would seem to me to encourage the commission to work in silos. That would not be particularly helpful in bringing the regulation of health and social care closer together, which is what many of us want to do.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000028"></a>Setting that objection aside, neither of those ideas will necessarily ensure that the risk of the poor relation syndrome is diminished. By itself, having a commissioner with extensive previous experience of adult social care, sensible though that would be, would not prevent resources being sucked away from social care regulation and into health care regulation. In the end, what will matter is the spotlight of public accountability. The more transparent the workings of the commission, the more likely it will be that no area of its work will be unduly advantaged at the expense of another.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000029"></a>The amendment proposes that accountability to Parliament would be a way in which to achieve this end&#151;a system of reporting to Parliament not after the year end but before the year begins. At an appropriate moment, a Select Committee would receive the commission&#146;s business plan for the coming year and within that plan the commission would set out exactly how it proposed to allocate its budget between its various activity streams. It would have to stand ready to justify that allocation. Public scrutiny would therefore become the main safeguard against the unfair skewing of resources that some fear. Adopting this idea would also provide a means whereby the influence exercised by the department and Ministers over the commission&#146;s work programme would be healthily counterbalanced.</p>

I understand that argument but, again, I do not see departmental scrutiny in the same light as I do parliamentary scrutiny. Departmental scrutiny takes place behind closed doors and is not a process that exposes a public body to the transparent public questioning that is necessary if we are to avoid the kind of pitfalls that many fear.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000031"></a>I hope that the Minister will understand the motivation behind the amendment; it is a genuine attempt to tackle the widely held concerns that have been expressed without being too prescriptive about how the commission structures itself or sets about its business. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000032"></a><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08042138000130"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I shall add a few words to what my noble friend has said. In his usual way, he has presented the case well. I share his view that the Minister will not be totally enamoured of the amendment, but it is very important that the commission is seen to have the confidence of the general public though transparency, as my noble friend has said. We know that in the cockpit of the NHS are Ministers; our top board in the NHS is composed of politicians, who are ultimately responsible for performance. It is a very political organisation, which affects so many different lives&#151;people at their most raw and when they are suffering. We know at election time that the NHS is an enormous issue.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000033"></a>There is huge merit in introducing this added safeguard. The CQC should be removed from any sort of whiff of interference by the top board. When one is a Minister and responsible for the performance of the National Health Service, it is very painful and irritating to be criticised by a regulatory body. I remember when the Audit Commission was responsible for the National Health Service as well as local government. We dreaded its reports; we knew that it was going to come out with things that needed addressing. In fact, that was very healthy. But for all of us, in individual as well as in corporate lives, criticism is extremely uncomfortable.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000034"></a>However, these things need to be said&#151;and it is interesting that the Government have with enormous skill established Monitor. That is another regulatory body that really is independent. When the department felt that it should be responsible for what was going on in foundation trusts in terms of healthcare-acquired infections, Monitor came in very strongly and said, &#147;No, that is part of our regulation, not yours&#148;. It was that very clear accountability that enabled it to do that, in addition to having a powerful chairman appointed and a very effective board.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000035"></a>This amendment would ensure that the commission was totally independent. It is still of course accountable to Parliament. I like the way in which the ombudsman regulates and the fact that it has a select committee to which it reports. There are mechanisms that we know work, which enhance the reputation of the regulator, and we feel that this is an issue that needs addressing. Clearly, we would like the commission to report directly to Parliament.</p>

This reflects the debate that we have had time and again.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000037"></a>I want to make some very small points. First, none of us speaking in this debate who are anxious about the changes are averse to change. My history is full of change management; it is what I do. It is when change lacks clarity that it is a problem&#151;and the problem about this change goes back to the debate that we had several hours ago in this Room about objectives. I am still unclear about the objects and direction that this regulation is going to take, which is why I seriously support this amendment, because it would give clarity to outlining which way forward is going to be taken right at the beginning of a year. In any event I hope that by the end of the discussions on the Bill we have a clearer set of objectives, although that may not deny the need for this amendment.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000038"></a>This amendment would give a little reassurance to the many people out there who are seriously concerned, because services are all about resources. Indeed, as we know, the Bill is all about resources. The resources will go to the strongest challenger unless the Bill contains something that says they must be balanced. That is why I support the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000039"></a><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0006.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08042138000132"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> I also support this amendment, which would help to ensure greater transparency in the way that the Care Quality Commission allocates its resources across the three core areas of its remit of health, social care and mental health. Both the outgoing social care regulator and the Mental Health Act Commission have expressed particularly strong concerns that their area of work risks being submerged, as we have heard many times already today and will many times again, or that their work will be deprioritised, given the much greater political attention devoted to mainstream health services. They say this not out of professional insularity but because they know that it would impact negatively on the life chances of those who are most vulnerable to abuses of their human rights and who require the greatest level of support to enjoy independent living. The amendment would guard against that as the CQC would need to account to Parliament annually on how it divides its resources and effort across the three core areas.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000040"></a>Moreover, the amendment would require the CQC to set out how it intends to involve people who use health and adult social care services, including their families and carers, in drawing up its programmes of work. We cannot afford to leave user involvement to the discretion of the new commission. If we want a user-focused regulator, we must insist on this now so that it is embedded in the CQC&#146;s plans from day one. </p>

It will be incredibly difficult to balance healthcare inspection against social care inspection because ultimately there will be limited resources. In inspecting, there are services clearly above the line and those that are clearly below the line, but it is those in the grey area in between that are particularly difficult and it is the patients or users and their carers

I shall never forget my experience of being involved in prosecuting what was then called an EMI home and, working with the police, the incredible difficulty of getting evidence of what we suspected was really going on. In fact, what we discovered was even worse than we could ever have suspected.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000042"></a>The other advantage of having a declaration of a work pattern ahead of the year is that it acts as a warning shot to services that they will be under scrutiny. The healthcare, social care and mental health services will all be looked at. Therefore, not only will the regulator have to ensure that all parts are looked at adequately but the services themselves will have to address the way that they interface.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000044"></a>That argument in its most populist form can be expressed by considering what has happened in the case of revealing the expenses of Members of Parliament. That has had a huge influence on the debate and it has also had a major effect in Scotland, where the new regime is in place. I use that only as a populist example but it is an indicator of what happens in all conditions where transparency is the rule of the day. I believe that in many ways this amendment would be extremely helpful to Members of Parliament in the other place in that, when referring to constituency issues, it would give them the opportunity to draw a distinction between expenditure in the whole area of social care, which appears to be at some risk under the provisions of the Bill, and expenditure in the area of acute care, which in my view at the moment appears likely to take the lion&#146;s share of resources. Therefore, I greatly welcome the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000045"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042138000135"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> Amendment No. 5 would place a duty on the Care Quality Commission to report to Parliament each year setting out its proposed activities for the future financial year and how it intended to allocate its resources. I agree that the commission, as an independent body, must be held accountable for its activities. I also appreciate the concerns here to ensure that the commission will take account of its objectives, the importance of patient and public involvement and the importance of treating health, social care and mental health services equitably when it is allocating resources and developing its forward plans. However, there are a number of reasons why I do not believe that the amendment is needed.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000046"></a>First, I agree that it is important that the Quality Care Commission sets out how it intends to use its resources. Of course, Clause 79 of the Bill already requires the commission to report annually to Parliament on how it has exercised its functions and what it has found as the current commissions do. These reports often include a forward look at plans for the coming year. The commission will, of course, also develop its business plan each year as the current commissions do. The current commissions also make their plans  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>publicly available and I see no reason why this would not continue to be an appropriate mechanism for setting out the body&#146;s plans in the future. In addition, Clause 77 requires the Care Quality Commission to publish a programme of the reviews, studies and other similar activities it intends to carry out in the following year.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000047"></a>On the specific proposals in the amendment, we have already spoken about the objectives. The commission will need to have regard to its objectives in everything that it does, so its business plan will set out how it will fulfil its objectives. That is what a business plan is for.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000048"></a>I disagree that it would be appropriate to ask the commission to distinguish between what resource it intends to allocate across health, social care and mental health. We are creating the Care Quality Commission to take an integrated approach to regulation as far as possible. Asking it to attempt crudely to allocate resources in this way would run counter to that approach.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000049"></a>Finally, throughout the passage of the Bill there has been considerable debate on the involvement of the public and those who use care services in the work of the commission. We will be debating the issue at length later, I am sure, but at this stage I agree that we would expect the commission to make its methodologies on this publicly available. On the point of transparency, Clause 2(3)(f) makes reference to best practice and that the CQC should be transparent in its regulatory action. As I have explained, the new commission will make publicly available all the information suggested in the amendment about its planned activities. Given this and the pressures that there are already on parliamentary time&#151;as we have rehearsed, we do not want to come back here and re-debate the Bill in two or three years time&#151;I do not believe that additional requirements to report to Parliament are necessary.</p>

Subsection (1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042138000110"></a>&#147;The Commission must from time to time, or at such times that the Secretary of State may specify by order, prepare and publish a document&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="08042138000100"></a>and so on. That is our concern, because the Secretary of State is specifying. We would like to give the commission more freedom and accountability to Parliament, rather than the Secretary of State. Subsection (2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042138000111"></a>&#147;Before preparing a document&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042138000101"></a>this relates to special reviews that we will discuss later&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042138000117"></a>&#147;the Commission must consult ... the Secretary of State&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042138000055"></a>That is our concern. We feel that the Secretary of State, not necessarily the present Secretary of State, but a future one, could heavily influence the commission regarding when it produces the documents and how it does that. Many of those documents will be unpalatable and, therefore, the Secretary of State could lean on the commission not to produce those documents either at the time of its choosing or with the content that it chooses.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, was right that the case for the amendment should be viewed in the same context as that for the first group of amendments that we debated today. It is all about giving the commission a better sense of independence and a better way of justifying what it does from year to year.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000059"></a>I heard what the Minister had to say and was not completely convinced. My noble friend Lady Cumberlege has already made some powerful points on that score. Clause 79, to which the Minister referred, is, as he will realise, a clause which provides for ex post facto reporting of the commission&#146;s activities, not reporting in advance. The key to my amendment was the idea that reporting in advance would enable the public to be reassured that the commission&#146;s work was not going to be hijacked in any way. By the time that a year is finished, it is too late.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000060"></a>I of course understand that we are all looking for an integrated approach to regulation, as the Minister pointed out, but that surely does not mean that the commission will be unable to distinguish between its various streams of activity. Clause 79 certainly implies that the commission will be required to distinguish between its streams of activity in presenting the reports for each financial year. So I was not totally persuaded by that point.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000061"></a>Nevertheless, there is much to reflect on here; I shall do just that between now and Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000065"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am sure that the Minister feels like he is facing yet another over of bowling on the same wicket, but in a slightly different style. Amendments Nos. 6 and 9 go back to the issue that we have talked about all afternoon; that is, ensuring appropriate representation of social care in the CQC.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000066"></a>In the previous amendment, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, sought to attack the issue in a different way. Amendment No. 6 is predicated on the belief that it is people and the experience that they bring to an organisation, especially in its formative stages, that set the culture and priorities of that body. I return to the matter that I raised earlier: the advert for the chair of the CQC. It was evident from that advert that the social care was certainly not to be included with anything like the same status as healthcare. That has set many fears running throughout the world of social care.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000067"></a>It is always difficult for the Opposition during debates on Bills such as this to argue at one and the same time that an organisation should be independent and that it should seek to make lots of representations about how it should be formed and what it should do. I think that it is legitimate to go as far as we do in the amendment, and probably not much further, in determining who ought to be the members of the commission, for the reasons that I have already outlined.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000068"></a>It is inconceivable that the CQC could do its job effectively were it not to have in its membership someone with extensive experience of social care, local government and the history of the development of social care up to this point. I remind the Committee that the advert for the chair did not mention the need for the chair to have any experience of local government or the independent sector.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000069"></a>There should also be a small governing body that consists of non-executives. It is quite clear from the advert published in March that the model used was that of a strategic health authority, because it took the health service model of having a mixed board of executives and non-executives. That is not standard practice in social care and does not reflect the governance structure of many of the bodies that the CQC will be regulating. Throughout social care, no matter what size the body, it is the norm for there to be a non-executive body&#151;trustees, board members or whatever&#151;to set the strategic direction of an organisation and provide a line of accountability. The body then employs executives to implement that.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000070"></a>There are parallels. The Audit Commission, for example, has a board of commissioners. They set standards, strategy and objectives; they set the budget; they monitor performance; they are responsible in law for accountability; and they govern the actions of the body within its statutory remit. That governance model is appropriate to the body that we are setting up

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000071"></a>I anticipate one argument that may be advanced by the Minister in his attempt to resist the amendment: why do we not then say that there ought to be members who represent the different strands of users within social care? That is unnecessary. It is entirely possible for someone who comes from a social care background to understand issues common across all social care groups. I do not believe that all social care needs are the same or that all client groups necessarily have the same priorities. I have worked for most of my life with older people and I understand that issues to do with them are distinct and different from issues to do with adults with physical or learning disabilities, and they are wholly different from those which apply to children. But those distinctions are of a different order from the distinction between healthcare and medical care, which are presaged on a separate basis of need and decision-making. It is therefore possible to have one member who comes from a social care background.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000072"></a>Amendment No. 9 proposes that there should be a children and adult rights director. I simply refer the Committee to the earlier speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in which he made much of my case for me. CSCI has done outstanding work over the past few years on children&#146;s issues, but the majority of what it had to do with children has been taken off to Ofsted. Nevertheless, there remains a whole raft of social care issues relating to children and it is important that in this body there is someone with the expertise, knowledge and understanding to work on children&#146;s issues. People who work in children&#146;s issues have to maintain a separate set of relationships with, for example, schools, CAFCASS and adoption agencies; it is a different world to any other part of social care. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, made the case effectively when he mentioned the safeguarding of children work that is done by CSCI. To lose that&#151;and there is a huge danger that it could be lost&#151;would be a disaster.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000073"></a>It is important that from the very beginning there is someone in this body who understands a rights-based approach to social care and who has the knowledge and the power to stand up to the sometimes powerful and overwhelming cases made by health and, in particular, acute health services for attention. We need people who, as they are in social care, have the experience and the wherewithal to sit within the body and to keep asking the questions which are difficult to answer, not least because they generally have a long lead-in and are difficult to measure within a short space of time.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000074"></a>I fully expect members of the Committee to say that this will be too restrictive on the new commission. I do not believe it will be. In many ways the proposal is essential to the body doing its job properly and to it having the right amount of standing within the social care world, which it certainly does not have at the moment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000075"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08042138000144"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I am anxious to get on and get home, which means that I shall be brief. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has made the arguments on the two amendments and I wish to add only two points. The Government should learn from their experience in these areas, in particular from CAFCASS where the first board had few people, if any, who really understood the nature of the task. That was obviously a disaster. It is absolutely crucial that a board has within it people who understand the nature of the service it is delivering. That does not mean that it has to be totally made up of those kinds of people. I helped to regulate meat hygiene, which is a bit different. After regulating meat hygiene, food standards and telecoms, I am absolutely clear that the difference is that people who understand about quality and protection&#151;which become ingrained within you if work in these fields&#151;need to be on boards such as these because such issues are often seriously overlooked.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000076"></a>I shall speak to the other amendment in my name. Roger Morgan, the children&#146;s rights director at the Commission for Social Care Inspection, has been continually concerned about the rights and care of children in hospitals. That does not mean that he thinks that hospitals are getting it all wrong, but that there is no one with inspectorial overview or who is able to talk with children about their experiences and, consequently, to draw out issues that might be useful for the whole of the health service. He has tried very hard to keep that bridge, but that has been more difficult since he has been at Ofsted, which has a strong educational pull. Therefore, it is vital that the new commission appoints a children and adult rights director who can focus on those issues and talk to users right across the spectrum, draw out their thinking, feed it back into the commission and, I hope, change services.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000077"></a>I have things to say about the advert and the appointment. The post was mentioned earlier and I do not know whether that relates to Amendments Nos. 7 and 8. I know that the Minister said that he would look at the issue at some point. Maybe he can then tell us where we are on all this.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000078"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08042138000145"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> I support the amendments and I share with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, the unfortunate experience of CAFCASS having a board that was originally made up of people who, as the result of a deliberate policy decision, knew nothing about the issues. I hope that that will serve as an awful warning to the Government. The other thing that we might draw from the CAFCASS experience is the necessity and value of separating governance from management. I commend that to the Minister, because if you mix the strategic focus and the development of policy with delivery, you will get into trouble. I hope that we can keep those two things separate and ensure that the requisite experience, not just of current practice in social care, but of its history, can be embedded in this new body.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000079"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08042138000146"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> This is a strange group of amendments, in that three completely separate issues are being addressed. The first relates to someone or some people with definite experience in social care  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services. The points in relation to that were clear and well made. I suspect that any commission will fail unless the various key elements are represented by people who have &#147;been there and done that&#148;.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000080"></a>I want to pick up on the second part of Amendment No. 6, relating to whether the board is non-executive or mixed. I am well aware of, and have served on, NHS boards where there is a mixture, although most of my experience has been serving on boards which have been entirely non-executive. There may be a case&#151;of which I am not entirely convinced, I have to say&#151;for most health service boards having a mixed structure of executive and non-executive members, given that they are subordinate bodies that report up a management line and implement things down a particular set of tram lines. This board is very different. It is about setting a strategy, philosophy and style. The interests and ways of operation of the executives of that body and those of non-executives who set the overall strategy are distinct. I cannot see a case for this body having a mixed board of executives and non-executives.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000081"></a>Amendment No. 9 raises a completely different set of issues. I have a lot of sympathy with it. It is perhaps not as precisely drafted and defined as Amendment No. 6, but the principle is clear. In most of the areas that the new commission will regulate, one is talking about people who are very vulnerable. In some instances, they are transitorily vulnerable by virtue of an illness or catastrophe which has befallen them, but in far more cases they will continue to be vulnerable for a variety of reasons. There is a great danger in healthcare and social care, and certainly in mental health care, of over-professionalisation of the way in which those interests are addressed. For that reason, one must ensure that something is built into the new commission, either by this kind of amendment or something else, to act as a counterweight to some of the professional voices which will be heard about a particular style of care, whether it is healthcare or social care.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000082"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08042138000147"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I simply want to make a correction. Foundation trust boards are mixed; they do not report up the line; they are entirely responsible for the work of their trust; and if it all goes wrong, they will simply be sacked by Monitor, which is the regulator and the only body above a foundation trust board. My understanding is that an awful lot of private sector boards are exactly the same: they are mixed and they are ultimately responsible for the operation of the organisation. Mixed boards work very well. What one needs is absolute clarity on the part of the executive and non-executive directors about their role. So long as one has really good selection procedures, it is a good model.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000083"></a><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80421-gc0007.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08042138000148"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out various matters relating to the constitution of the commission. It makes various provisions necessary to establish the commission and to enable it to carry out its functions independently and competently.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000084"></a>I have great sympathy with the proposal that social expertise be reflected on the board of the commission. The commission will need to be composed of members  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC247"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from a variety of backgrounds to ensure that it can discharge its functions effectively. We fully recognise this and made it clear in the information made available by the appointments commission to potential applicants for the posts of shadow commissioners. The shadow chair, when appointed, will be involved in the recruitment of commissioners and will be in the best position to assess what combination of skills and expertise would be most useful to help the commission realise its goals across its full range of functions. I anticipate that there will be members with social care expertise.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000085"></a>It is arguable that the background of the commissioners is less relevant than their collective responsibility to ensure that the commission fulfils all its statutory responsibilities. These include substantial responsibilities in the social care field. The commission will be held accountable for how it discharges them.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000086"></a>The amendments also propose that all members of the commission be appointed on a non-executive basis. The wording that we have adopted in Schedule 1 is exactly the same as that used in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, under which both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI are comprised of non-executive members. It is our intention that the same model will apply for the Care Quality Commission.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000087"></a>Amendment No. 9 proposes that the commission appoint a children and adult rights director with specific responsibility for embedding a rights-based approach. It suggests that they would be an employee and also a member of the commission, which seems to contradict the principle in Amendment No. 6 that the commission should have only non-executive members.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80421-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="80421-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000088"></a>That aside, I have to disagree that the amendment is necessary. The commission will already be under a duty to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children and vulnerable adults under Clause 2. We have also ensured that the proposed registration requirements are consistent with requirements in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000089"></a>As a public authority, the commission will be under a duty to act compatibly with the Human Rights Act. At Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Patel of Bradford referred to the excellent work that the Mental Health Act Commission has done in its project, Human Rights: Making It Real, to embed a human rights ethos into the work of the commission. This work has also been embraced by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. There is nothing preventing the commission from taking a similar approach. Indeed, I shall encourage it. As I said at Second Reading, we are working with the Mental Health Act Commission and other commissions to ensure that the Care Quality Commission learns from the culture and ways of working that they have developed.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000090"></a>Again, while it may be tempting to specify that there should be board members with specific remits in relation to the particular functions or responsibilities that the commission will have, I do not agree that this would add anything over and above what we have already committed to. The commission may or may  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC248"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column GC248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not decide to have specific members leading on particular issues for the board. I believe that there are arguments both for and against that approach. It can mean the difference between the compartmentalisation of a particular issue and the integration of that issue into every aspect of the organisation&#146;s work and culture. There is also nothing to prevent the board appointing experts to give specific advice where it is needed and to provide additional expertise. Indeed, the Bill as drafted specifically provides for this. Fundamentally, though, as an independent body the new organisation should establish the division of responsibilities and the organisational structures it decides it needs to best carry out its statutory functions, rather than imposing something centrally.</p>

<a name="80421-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042138000091"></a>Having given our reasoning for not specifying particular posts on the board and clarifying that Schedule 1 provides for a non-executive board, I hope the noble Baroness is now content to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I wish to take issue with one point. Amendment No. 9 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042138000115"></a>&#147;The Commission must also appoint a Children and Adult Rights Director, who is to be an employee of the Commission&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08042138000102"></a>Where on earth does that suggest that it should be a board member? It does not. We need an understanding of what a member is because it will be important for all kinds of amendments further down the line.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0804218000011"></a>I am today placing in the Library of the House copies of the report of the annual meeting to review the Compact held on 13 December 2007.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0804218000012"></a>The annual meeting looked at the successes of the Compact and the challenges for the coming year. The Joint Compact Action Plan for 2008-09 sets out a programme of work designed to:</p>
strengthen relationships and partnerships at national level, to deliver the national Compact;strengthen relationships and partnerships at local level, supported by local and regional compacts and action plans;increase understanding of the role of the Compact in promoting equality and community cohesion;strengthen the independence, voice and campaigning work of the sector; andensure the Compact and Codes are fully up to date in a changing legislative and policy environment.
<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0804218000013"></a>Following the annual meeting, we have drawn up a more comprehensive implementation plan, to support the Joint Action Plan, with the Commission, Compact Voice and key delivery partners. This is available on the Compact website at <a href="http://www.thecompact.org.uk">www.thecompact.org.uk</a>.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0804218000014"></a>This year the Compact will celebrate its tenth anniversary. The Government are committed to ensuring the Compact is stronger than ever. It remains integral to better partnership working and better decision-making. We need to ensure that the Compact becomes embedded in our day to day thinking, and that it becomes a story of change to drive better outcomes for communities and the people they serve.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0804218000015"></a>The independent Commission for the Compact is working with Compact Voice and the Office of the Third Sector, to oversee the operation of the Compact. I have appointed Sir Bert Massie as the new Commissioner for the Compact, who will push for greater compliance with the Compact. I have also pledged an increased investment to the Commissioner for the Compact of &#163;6 million over the next three years and nearly &#163;1 million to Compact Voice, which represents the sector interests. This will ensure that we can drive forward better partnership between government and the third sector.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0804218000016"></a>The next Compact annual meeting will hold partners to account on delivery of the actions in the Joint Compact Action Plan. The Commission, Government and the sector will report to the next meeting. As part of the Compact annual review 2008 report, the Minister for the Third Sector will report on progress in meeting the Government&#146;s commitment to three-year funding for the third sector.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0804218000018"></a>I am today announcing the outcome of the recent consultation on Public Law Family Fees. The consultation published on 19 December 2007 and the consultation closed on 11 March 2008. One hundred and eleven responses were received from local authorities, law professionals, the judiciary and other stakeholder bodies.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0804218000019"></a>After careful consideration of these, my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has decided to proceed with the increases proposed. The statutory instruments were laid before Parliament on 9 April 2008.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0804218000020"></a>During the course of consultation, the Government introduced an adjustment into the local government finance settlement figures to make visible the sums attributable to these proposals.  The purpose of this adjustment was to ensure that a valid comparison could be made between 2007-08 and 2008-09 for each authority&#146;s grant increase. The authorities generally now recognise that funding has been made available within the revenue support grant.  Indeed, the total of &#163;40 million is likely to exceed the total fees payable because it assumes that the maximum fee is paid in each case.  In reality, some cases following the new &#147;Public Law Outline&#148; procedure (implemented this month, introduces revised judicial case management procedures to be introduced in all family courts) will be resolved at earlier stages and pay a lower fee.  I therefore believe that we have responded in full to those responses that objected to the proposals on the basis that it was not clear that authorities had been funded, or that they had been insufficiently funded, to pay these fees. </p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0804218000021"></a>The second main theme of the responses was that authorities would be improperly  influenced by financial considerations and would not always act in the best interests of children.  Local authorities are under a statutory duty to protect children at risk of significant harm. Both the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services, in their responses to the consultation, confirmed that local authorities are not influenced by cost considerations in their approach to initiating proceedings or in their decisions about appropriate pre-proceedings work.  The practical effect of the statutory duty in this instance is to require authorities to ensure that adequate budgetary provision is made to pay the necessary court fees, and to ensure that individual decisions are not affected by budgetary considerations.  In practice, most local authorities pay court fees from a legal department or similar central budget, rather than from a children&#146;s services budget that is the responsibility of individual social workers making decisions on the ground. With the cost of court fees being a small proportion of the overall cost of child care proceedings.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that the proposals do not in fact create a risk that local authorities will neglect their statutory duty causing children to be harmed.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0804218000022"></a>These fee increases are necessary to ensure that the family courts are properly funded and are designed to fit with wider reforms on child protection proceedings. They are a further step in our strategy to ensure that the system of court fees is fair and sustainable, and they reflect the long-standing policy of governments of all persuasions that statutory fees should generally be set at a level that recovers the cost of the service provided (but no more).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0804218000038"></a>The DDRB has recommended that the national salary scales for all salaried doctors and dentists, and the top and bottom of the salary range for salaried general medical practitioners, should be increased by 2.2 per cent for 2008-09. For general dental practitioners (GDPs), the DDRB has recommended a 3.4 per cent increase in the gross earnings base. The DDRB intends this to result in an increase in GDPs&#146; net income of 2.2 per cent.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0804218000039"></a>With regard to independent contractor general medical practitioners (GMPs), the DDRB has recognised in its report that there are significant, unwarranted variations  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS145"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column WS145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in GMP income caused solely by the operation of the minimum practice income guarantee (MPIG) regardless of the workload and patient care provided by individual GMPs and their practices. It notes the evidence presented to it that GMP income varied from &#163;54.72 per patient (where there was no MPIG) to &#163;120 per patient (where there was MPIG). In making its recommendations, including the 2.7 per cent uplift to a GMP&#146;s global sum, the DDRB acknowledged, and therefore clearly intended, that the practical implication of their recommendations was that most practices would not receive any increase in their global sum. This is predicated on any increase in global sum being offset against the correction factor in MPIG. The department estimates that implementing these recommendations means the 6 to 7 per cent of GMS practices without any MPIG would receive an increase in their global sum payments of 2.7 per cent in 2008/09. A further 2 per cent of practices will receive some extra increase in payments as their current correction factor will be less than their increase in global sum.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0804218000040"></a>In addition to any DDRB recommendations, we have guaranteed to the profession that once the costs of implementing the recommendations of the DDRB have been agreed with the British Medical Association, the Government will ensure up to 1.5 per cent of new investment is available across all practices for providing more services or improving the quality of care and provision to existing patients.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0804218000041"></a>The DDRB&#146;s pay recommendations have been accepted in full by the Government, without staging. However, in taking forward the DDRB&#146;s recommendations on GMP pay there remain issues that will require further consultation with the BMA before they can be implemented and that will delay payments to GMPs.</p>

The proposed three-year package is now subject to consultation by members of all the trade unions covered by Agenda for Change. It includes:</p>
acceptance in full of the 2008-09 NHS Pay Review Body&#146;s (NHSPRB) recommendations for a 2.75 per cent pay rise for staff on Agenda for Change from 1 April 2008;2.4 per cent headline award in 2009-10; 2.25 per cent headline award in 2010-11; andadditional changes to the pay structure in years two and three that would give extra financial support for the lowest paid workers, allow quicker progression up the pay ladder and increase the earning potential for hundreds of thousands of staff.

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0804218000051"></a>The constitutional crisis in Zimbabwe continues as President Mugabe persists in his ambition to steal the election. It is over three weeks since the elections were held but the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is yet to announce the presidential results. More worryingly President Mugabe and his ZANU(PF) party have unleashed a campaign of violence against those ordinary Zimbabweans, sixty per cent of them, who in spite of everything voted against him. Political refugees from the rural areas that were once President Mugabe&#146;s heartlands but have had the courage to express their opposition peacefully through the ballot box have been pouring into urban centres to receive medical treatment and support. Local and international  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS147"></a><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column WS147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NGOs are highlighting these abuses daily. Evidence that they are taking place is irrefutable. I believe all would join the Government in condemning absolutely these acts of violence which are cynically intended to punish people for the choices they have made and to intimidate them into submission should any second round of the presidential election be called.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0804218000052"></a>Meanwhile in spite of numerous legal protests by the opposition, the Electoral Commission has begun a recount in 23 constituencies. No one can have any faith in this recount. The ballot boxes have been kept in uncertain conditions. The Electoral Commission has seen 13 of its number arrested in a clear effort to threaten and punish those who did their job independently. The count itself is proceeding at a ludicrously slow rate. This only serves to fuel suspicion that President Mugabe is seeking to reverse the results that have been published, to regain a majority in Parliament, and to amplify his own count in the presidential election. If that is the case, then what we are witnessing is a charade of democracy. We can have little confidence that whatever is ultimately announced as the presidential election results will not have been sullied and contaminated by rigging during this recount.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0804218000053"></a>We continue to engage intensively to resolve this crisis and our action is focused in three areas. First, we continue to work to support all those working for democratic change in Zimbabwe. In spite of the challenges it faces, civil society in Zimbabwe remains committed to democratic and peaceful change. We applaud and support its efforts.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0804218000054"></a>Secondly, we continue to work with states in the region. We believe they are still best placed to apply pressure on President Mugabe and those who surround him, many of whom recognise that it is time for change. I welcome the statements of the African Union and of the Southern African Development Community calling for the presidential results to be released. That SADC states met in an extraordinary session in Lusaka and discussed Zimbabwe and its crisis for over 13 hours shows their concern at what is happening and the threat that it poses to the stability and security of their region. But, as the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, it is important that African leaders do more to engage directly in this crisis to help resolve it. The reaction of South African dockers to the direction to unload arms they believed destined for Zimbabwe shows that ordinary Africans do not condone the way in which President Mugabe is clinging to power and beating his own people to death to ensure he retains it. If President Mugabe and those who keep him in office will listen to anyone, they will listen to their peers in the region and in Africa more widely. But if they will not, Africans and their organisations should be clear in their public condemnation of what is happening and should withhold their recognition of President Mugabe&#146;s regime. His actions pose a threat to democracy and to the values that

<a name="80421-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0804218000055"></a>Thirdly, we are working through the international community as it remains united in standing up for democracy, it reinforces the confidence of democratic forces, and speaks with a clear voice about the value not just to Zimbabwe but to the whole region of following the will of the people. At the UN Security Council session in New York last week, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister joined other voices from Africa, Europe and Latin America, along with the UN Secretary-General in calling for the election results to be released and in condemning the delay and violence. The UN Secretary-General has called for international monitors to observe any second round in Zimbabwe. We support that call and underline, as SADC leaders themselves did when meeting in Lusaka, that SADC observers must return now to observe the recount. They should be present in Zimbabwe until the election results are announced, so they may witness and ideally prevent the violence that is now occurring.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0804218000056"></a>The European Union, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and many other states have called both for restraint within Zimbabwe and for credible results now to be released. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister, my noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown and I continue to engage in intensive private discussions with African leaders and others with influence within Zimbabwe and the region. Our message is simple. Zimbabwe is on a knife edge: inflation is incalculable, life expectancy the lowest in the world and human rights abuses commonplace. Those metrics will all deteriorate if President Mugabe is allowed to steal this election. But if a government who reflect the will of the people are allowed to emerge, Zimbabwe can begin the painful journey to recovery and once again become a full part of the international community.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0804218000057"></a>Britain has always supported the Zimbabwean people. We are the second largest bilateral donor. We spent &#163;45 million last year on support for the poorest and most vulnerable Zimbabweans. Our support helped feed up to three million people and provided treatment for more than 30,000 HIV/AIDS patients. That support will continue. It has become even more necessary in this period when President Mugabe has unleashed his youth militia on the people. But when there is positive change on the ground in Zimbabwe and a government who are prepared to introduce sound governance and respond to the needs of ordinary Zimbabweans, Britain will play a full part in supporting recovery and development. It will be a huge task. But the Zimbabwean people will have the full support of the UK and the wider international community. The UK and other donors are ready to give that support when there is a return to real democracy and good governance within Zimbabwe.</p>

<a name="80421-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0804218000058"></a>I am sure the whole House will join the Government in committing themselves to working tirelessly for that day.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_336"></a><a name="08042112000586"></a>MTHR studies found no epidemiological association between short-term mobile telephone use (less than 10 years) and cancers of the brain and nervous system. The report noted that the situation for longer exposure times is less clear and recommended work to assess whether exposure to mobile telephone radiofrequencies in the longer term increases the risk of developing brain and nervous system tumours. A cohort study to investigate a wide range of potential effects including brain cancer is under way at Imperial College, London.</p>

Taking an approach where the name of a clinic reporting an incident is not made public, the HFEA has worked with clinics to encourage greater reporting, particularly of lower risk incidents or those that are &#147;near misses&#148;. This is to ensure that lessons learnt from such events can be circulated to other clinics, so avoiding a repeat elsewhere in the sector.</p>

We have seen the International Organisation for Migration's (IOM) recent assessment that more than 5.1 million people are now displaced, of whom 2.7 million are displaced inside Iraq. The IOM also estimates that more than 75 per cent of internally displaced people do not have access to government food rations, nearly 20 per cent do not have access to clean water and 33 per cent cannot obtain the medicines they require. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate data on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, and the figures quoted by humanitarian agencies vary. For example, UNHCR has recently reported that the total number of displaced Iraqis is around 4.4 million, of which 2.4 million are displaced inside Iraq.</p>

In March this year, DfID announced a further &#163;15 million in humanitarian assistance for vulnerable Iraqis, including a &#163;1.5 million contribution to the IOM. This money will support humanitarian operations, including efforts to fill the gaps in the Government's food distribution system, repair water and sanitation structures, and rehabilitate

<a name="80421w0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_382"></a><a name="08042112000662"></a>It is a priority for the UK Government to alleviate humanitarian suffering among displaced and vulnerable Iraqis. This is the reason the Department for International Development has recently announced a further &#163;15 million in humanitarian assistance. The money will go to the UN-led Consolidated Appeal for Iraq, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). This takes the UK Government's overall humanitarian assistance contributions for Iraq to &#163;147 million since 2003. DfID's contributions have supported the provision of food, financial and legal aid to displaced and other vulnerable Iraqis. It has also supported the rehabilitation of hospital water and sanitation structures in Iraq and the upgrading of health and education facilities in host communities and countries. In addition, the UK is a major contributor to the European Commission (EC). Last year, the EC allocated &#8364;50 million in support of Iraqi refugees in the Middle East region. This included &#8364;9 million to support Syrian public health services in areas with large Iraqi populations, and &#8364;26.7 million to build capacity in the Jordanian education sector to accommodate Iraqi refugee children.</p>

<a name="80421w0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_383"></a><a name="08042112000663"></a>DfID's contributions to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) support the protection of Iraqi refugees in the Middle East region. By registering with UNHCR, refugees obtain improved legal protection in countries that have not signed up to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention. UNHCR is continuously increasing its outreach efforts to register more Iraqis in countries such as Jordan and Syria. UNHCR also provides food and financial assistance to prevent destitution among the refugees. Other protection measures include UNHCR support to safe houses for victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable women and children in Syria.</p>

We have also improved water supply to 60,000 people in al-Amtahiyah, and constructed a water training centre in Basra to increase the skills of Iraqi engineers in water treatment and leakage repair.

Individuals can also take action within their own homes that both reduces their impact on the environment and provides financial benefits by reducing their energy bills. The Government have recently launched the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT), which obliges energy suppliers to install energy efficiency measures and promote reductions in carbon emissions for households. Under the CERT scheme, many energy companies offer free and discounted loft and cavity wall insulation. Further to this, the 2006 Pre-Budget Report announced a stamp duty land tax relief for new zero-carbon homes, and Budget 2008 announced that this incentive would be extended to new flats. Budget 2008 also provided further incentives to choose eco-friendly transportation by announcing significant reform of vehicle excise duty.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_601"></a><a name="08042112000981"></a>The decline in new planting is due to a number of factors including the implementation of the response to the 2002 Sustaining England's Woodlands review. This included the introduction of the new English woodland grant scheme in 2005, which placed increased emphasis on the sustainable management of existing woodland rather than the creation of new woodland.</p>

These figures, which include areas restocked by natural regeneration, are for the commission's own land and the area of woodland receiving grant aid from the Forestry Commission. This area would include land that had been restocked after clearance of windblown trees and cleared through normal harvesting activities.</p>
