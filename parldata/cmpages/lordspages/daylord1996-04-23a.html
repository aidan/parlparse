<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether legal aid was awarded to Mr. Andreas Pavel to sue Sony for breach of patent rights; and, if so, where Mr. Pavel resided at the time of the award; how much was awarded; and under what circumstances.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Mackay of Clashfern): </B>  My Lords, Mr. Pavel was not legally aided for the proceedings in the court of first instance. He was, however, granted legal aid to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the Patents County Court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-01_para0"></a>As to Mr. Pavel's place of residence, the Legal Aid Board is prevented by Section 38 of the Legal Aid Act from disclosing information provided to it in connection with an application for legal aid. The legal aid costs of the appeal will only be known once the bills have been taxed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble and learned Lord understand that it seems very strange to ordinary people in this country that a German citizen living in Milan can sue a Japanese-based company through British courts and manage to obtain, as I understand from the Daily Telegraph, &#163;0.5 million in legal aid? Is the noble and learned Lord aware also that the judge concerned in the final decision expressed serious reservations about the length of time that both counsel spent dragging out the case for their own financial benefit? Is that not highly undesirable? Will the noble and learned Lord look into the matter? I understand that the money may not yet have been paid. Will the noble and learned Lord take the necessary action to withhold the payment of that money?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, there are a number of aspects in relation to the current aspects for legal aid which I regard as necessary to be reviewed. Your Lordships will know that I issued a Green Paper suggesting fairly considerable changes to the system. I am reviewing the responses to that document at present with a view to bringing out a White Paper as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-01_para1"></a>As regards this particular case, the criticisms to which the noble Lord referred in the Court of Appeal related to the proceedings in the Patents County Court when no legal aid was granted. It is interesting to note what <P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Justice Aldous, who gave the leading judgment, said. I shall not weary your Lordships with all of it, but he said a good deal about the length of time that the proceedings had taken in a county court set up to deal swiftly and reasonably cheaply with patent matters. He spoke about how long it had taken and he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr. Pavel ended up needing legal aid". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words when he started the proceedings, he had some money. By the time they had finished, he required legal aid. That is the substance of the matter in relation to that particular court. The criticisms of the Court of Appeal were really levelled at what had taken place in the Patents County Court and the failures there.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-01_para2"></a>Needless to say, I wish to follow up this matter. The last but one sentence in the Lord Justice's opinion is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, some alteration is necessary if the purposes of the Patents County Court are to be achieved". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is a sentiment with which all your Lordships will agree. The question is how to achieve that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, will my noble and learned friend tell the House how much was paid to that man by way of legal aid?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, nothing was paid to this man. In due course the money will be paid on claim to his lawyers, who are practising in this country. I cannot tell the House the precise amount until the claims have been submitted. The case has been concluded only fairly recently.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend not agree that British taxpayers resent having to foot bills for people who do not live in this country? I understand that the Legal Aid Board is absolutely independent. Its terms of reference are quite obviously wrong and is it not high time that they were changed? Under no circumstances should people like the person in this case be afforded British taxpayers' money.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the terms of reference of the Legal Aid Board are fixed by legislation which is passed by Parliament. That is what I am seeking to review in the Green Paper that was published and in the responses which have come in to that Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-01_para3"></a>The question of who should be entitled to legal aid is difficult. The courts of this country obviously have jurisdiction in the matter and the precise outcome of the Green Paper will be awaited. I am not certain that all your Lordships have yet had an opportunity fully to respond to it, although the formal period for consultation has been concluded.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his detailed and long reply to my initial Question. I was, of course, aware that Mr. Pavel did not require any legal aid when he started his action and he would not have <P>


<a name="column_1013"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>required any legal aid if he had won, but he lost the case. I am still mystified as to how a German national who is not living in this country--as far as I know he has never resided in this country--can sue a Japanese-based company. Is he just using our legal system because it is a rather generous one from which he can obtain money for legal fees?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I have no doubt at all that our system of law is an extremely good one. From that point of view one would seek to have recourse to it. Mr. Pavel came to this action in the Patents County Court at his own expense. That is an important fact to keep in mind. He lost in the Patents County Court and by that stage, as the judge said, he needed legal aid for reasons which I have sought to explain. He then applied for legal aid. Before legal aid was granted obviously the Legal Aid Board had to seek legal opinion upon whether or not Mr. Pavel had reasonable prospects of success. The legal aid was eventually given. It is on that basis--as I understand it--having regard to the financial criteria laid down under the Act of Parliament and the opinion on prospects of success, that legal aid was granted.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What part they took in discussions leading to the Unidroit Convention on stolen and smuggled antiquities, why they have not signed the convention, and what measures they will take to restrain the sale in Great Britain of antiquities illegally excavated in and exported from other lands.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the United Kingdom was represented at the meetings to discuss the draft convention. While the convention's aims are laudable, the Government have not signed because its scope is too wide. All members of the UK antiquities trade subscribe to a code of practice agreeing not to deal in illegally excavated or exported antiquities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, first I thank my noble friend for that Answer. I accept that there are difficulties with the Unidroit Convention, but are the Government aware of the enormous scale of the looting of historic sites worldwide, and the colossal scale of the traffic in looted antiquities? Are the Government aware that London is a significant clearing house for this trade, whatever the code of practice may state? Will the Government look further into this and will my noble friend consider consulting the British Academy for its views on the matter?
<P>


<a name="column_1014"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether the scale of looting to which my noble friend referred is so colossal, but the antiques unit of the Organised Crime Group at New Scotland Yard has recently seized antiquities from Egypt, China and Turkey. I understand the police have established that the Chinese and Egyptian antiquities were illegally exported and that it has been established that some were stolen. The Turkish antiquities are still under investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-01_para4"></a>With regard to my noble friend's supplementary question about the British Academy, the Government do not seek advice from the British Academy. Expert advice on archaeological matters is sought from the British Museum. However, if my noble friend can give me a good reason to consult the British Academy I shall pass on that information to people who are more knowledgeable on this subject than I.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, what is the length of the limitation period under the Unidroit Convention during which action can be taken to recover objects which have been allegedly stolen or exported? Is it true that it is as long as 50 years?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, as regards the limitation period, a most unsatisfactory situation arises with that part of the convention dealing with stolen property as the provisions affect ownership. Bona fide purchasers and their heirs will not be sure that they have good title possibly for 50 years, or for 75 years, or in certain cases, for ever.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-01_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, does the timescale involved affect the British decision to refuse to return the Elgin Marbles?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   No, my Lords.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I sympathise with the Minister's noble friend's opposition to the illegal exporting of stolen treasures. Does she not agree that were we to sign the convention, it would be desirable to have in conjunction with it--as is the case in France, the United States and Canada--some anti-seizure legislation, because the risk under the convention is that a host country such as the UK, which hosts loans of art works from a second country, may have legal action taken against it to seize the works of art? To give specific examples, the Hermitage in Russia would be reluctant to loan its Impressionists to this country for fear of writs from the Germans. The Taiwanese would fear writs from the Chinese and the Israelis would fear writs from the Arabs. As a country, we must have protection from such action. Would the noble Baroness and the Government consider looking at the two together?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I totally understand the noble Lord's question. I point out to him that we support the principles of a European convention to provide a standard for the protection of archaeological sites and artefacts throughout Europe. The UK ratified the first European convention; and signed the revised one. However, we are currently considering whether we ratify the present form.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Gowrie: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend remain her usual robust self and refuse to sign this particular convention? While I have considerable sympathy with the aims of my noble friend Lord Renfrew in respect of antiquities, is it not the case that the convention is drawn so widely as to define cultural objects pertaining to literature, art or science, thereby effectively forbidding the trading in, and therefore the collecting of, cultural objects of any kind?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I accept what my noble friend said as he has a particular interest in this matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Derwent: </B>   My Lords, as a past chairman of the London and Provincial Antique Dealers' Association, I thank the noble Baroness for her caution about the convention. The definition is so widely drawn that it is fairly clear that the legitimate trade will move into countries which have not signed the convention. Is the noble Baroness aware that under the terms of the convention as drafted no owners of a work of art or their successors in perpetuity could ever be sure that their ownership might not be challenged?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the Government have not signed the Unidroit Convention. They have no intention of doing so. Therefore, the trade need have no fear of losing business to other countries.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that more and more government papers come out with initials. We have UNESCO, IMF and various other initials. What does Unidroit stand for?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to tell your Lordships that the full title is the International Institute for the Harmonisation of Private Law. It was founded by Mussolini.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, while accepting fully the point made by my noble friend Lord Derwent and my noble friend Lord Gowrie, the ex-chairman of Sotheby's, will the Minister confirm that at present it is legal to import into this country antiquities which have been illegally excavated overseas and illegally exported from their host countries? Is not that at the root of the present difficult situation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right. It is not an offence to import objects which have been illegally exported from another country; but under an EC regulation the UK cannot issue an export licence for export to a destination outside the European Community for an object which has been illegally exported from another member state. Under an EC directive such an object may be requested back by the source state.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, how many other countries in the European Union have not signed the Unidroit Convention?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, quite a few.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Molloy </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy on the future of Lappel Bank, the rare bird haven on the River Medway in Kent.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the Government decided to exclude Lappel Bank from the Medway estuary special protection area because the Lappel Bank was essential to the continued commercial viability of the port of Sheerness. Lappel Bank, though a habitat for migrating birds, was not important for any rare species listed in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive. We await the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case referred to it by this House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. He has indicated that he is aware that Lappel Bank is well known throughout Great Britain and on the Continent. It was designated to protect special wild birds. Indeed, the decision by Mr. John Gummer to abolish it was challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. I am quite sure that this House will not rule that that Royal Society should not be listened to.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-02_para0"></a>I understand that this House referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, but I have heard no result. The Minister is very kind and helpful. Many people have written to me about this issue. Will he agree that whatever the Government do, they should listen to the voice of the British people? The British people want this area preserved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, we decided that the Medway estuary should be divided into 4,681 hectares for the birds with 22 hectares for the people. That seems to me a very generous decision in favour of the birds.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe: </B>   My Lords, among the people who offer the Minister advice, is he aware of the concerns of the people of Sheerness? They require to work and find employment in that area.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, absolutely; and that is the reason that the Lappel Bank was excluded from that area.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give an indication of the European Commission's interest in this matter?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the European arrangements for designating the special protection areas for birds are Europe-wide for migratory species because they are a Europe-wide asset. We thoroughly support the efforts being made in Europe to designate safe areas for these birds. We also support the exclusion of certain limited areas which are necessary for the development of their adjacent human communities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, the Minister might have told my noble friend that this site was also worthy of protection under the RAMSAR and Berne Conventions as well as any European directive that may exist. <P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, Lappel Bank is now destroyed. Since it was excluded from this special protection area for economic rather than environmental reasons, do the Government agree that they have to bear some responsibility for compensation? Will the Department of the Environment discuss some method of compensation with English Nature?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, whether or not compensation arises is now a matter for the European Court of Justice. We shall wait to see what it says.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-02_para1"></a>Should compensation arise, there is no defined way in which compensation can be paid. That would be a matter of negotiation at first instance with the Commission. I imagine that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds might propose that we flood the entire Romney Marsh; we might propose to dump 22 hectares of estuarine mud on the Lodge at Sandy, Bedfordshire; and somewhere there would be a compromise. However, we cannot discuss any form of compensation at present.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, whatever the rights or wrongs of this specific site--there may be a balance to be sought as regards jobs--it seems to fall into a general pattern of setting profit before the preservation of the wildlife of this country. There has been a 50 per cent. reduction in song thrushes in this country over the past 25 years. What do the Government propose to do about that and about the other 23 birds now on the endangered list? We had only eight on that list 15 years ago.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, in the context of the Question, that is a totally ridiculous assertion and indicates the value that the party opposite places on jobs for the people of this country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister argue that the exclusion of 22 acres helped business? What proportion of the income gained are the Government willing to pay as compensation? If it did not raise any more income, then surely there is no point in the exercise.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the 22 acres were required as a vital part of the development of Sheerness. They now play a part in the commercial life of the port. In due course, if not now, that land will result in increased taxation for Her Majesty's Treasury, which is always desirable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-02_spnew26"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister reply to the question which I put to him? I asked what he was doing about the 23 species of bird which had declined by 50 per cent. over the past 15 years with the serious loss of songbirds, larks and so forth.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60423-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, that has nothing to do with the Question.

<A NAME="60423-03_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to ensure the continuance of the independent pharmacy in view of the recent referral of resale price maintenance to the Office of Fair Trading.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  My Lords, the review of resale price maintenance on medicaments being undertaken by the Office of Fair Trading is a matter for the director general. Representations concerning the viability of independent pharmacies and other aspects of the review should be made direct to him.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for that reply. Does he agree that the community pharmacist plays an important part in both the social fabric of this country and in the National Health Service? People are now recommended to seek advice from their community pharmacist and 94 per cent. of the population trusts the advice received. Does the Minister think it important to retain the availability of that service for people who are unable to get to supermarkets whose aim is to transfer most of the business to themselves?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that my noble friend appreciates that the director general has a duty to monitor and review the supply of goods exempted from the general prohibition on resale price maintenance. Clearly, the existence of the present exemption would reveal that there is good reason for there being such an exemption. I entirely agree with my noble friend that community pharmacies have an important part to play. As she rightly emphasised, the aim of improving health promotion is something which the Department of Health encourages.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para0"></a>Beyond the essential small pharmacies scheme, of which I am sure my noble friend is aware, which would protect pharmacies which may not have sufficient prescription business to be viable, the Government are bound to await the outcome of the review by the director general.

<A NAME="60423-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, until recently I was a member of the Council of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, so I have an interest to declare. I am also chairman of the Office of Health Economics so I have a pharmacy interest. In addition, is the noble and learned Lord aware that as an economist I am, and have always been, implacably opposed to resale price maintenance? I deplore the extent to which it continues, albeit apparently illegally, despite the efforts of the OFT.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para1"></a>Having said that as background, I ask the noble and learned Lord whether in this case one should reflect upon whether items of medicine, even general sales list medicines, should be treated as ordinary items of commerce. That is the central issue here. It relates to the continued existence of the independent pharmacist but there is the general question of whether one would like to see in shops price headlines such as "Get your insulin cheap today". One sees that in the United States. Is it an appropriate environment in which medicines should be traded? Have the Government reflected upon it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, if the Government have reflected on it, then at present I do not believe they are prepared to reveal that. They are bound to allow the director general to carry out his examination to see whether the present exemption should be continued.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para2"></a>Yes, of course there are powerful arguments over the matter. That is why there has been an exemption in the past. I invite the noble Lord, given the strength of his views, to make them known to the director general.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, has the noble and learned Lord noticed that my method of making my views known to the director general is to express them at this moment?

<A NAME="60423-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, will my noble and learned friend confirm that I am correct in thinking that the Office of Fair Trading is reviewing whether there have been sufficient changes in the market for non-prescription medicines to justify asking the court for leave to apply for a full hearing? Is he aware of the statement made by the supermarket chief executive in the Sunday press condemning the fact that the Office of Fair Trading was taking some time over the matter? He said that it was not a complex matter. However, it is a complex matter and it is important that it should be considered thoroughly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, it is a complex matter and the OFT anticipates that it will take until September to complete its review. I should have thought that in the circumstances that was entirely reasonable. My noble friend is right in saying that the director general is considering whether there is prima facie evidence of material change in the relevant circumstances since the exemption granted by the Restrictive Practices Court in 1970. It is not that I am unwilling to give an answer but, given that there is a statutory procedure to be followed, I am sure that it <P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para5"></a>This Motion invites the House to agree that the Second Reading and remaining stages of the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations, etc) Bill should be taken on Thursday of this week. Your Lordships will be aware that the Bill gives effect to the announcement on 21st March by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister of arrangements leading to all-party negotiations in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para6"></a>Her Majesty's Government regard it as of the utmost importance that the momentum of the peace process should be maintained. I hope that I am right in thinking that that view is generally shared by your Lordships' House. There are of course varying shades of opinion about the detailed contents of the Bill; but I think I am right in saying that the main thrust of the Bill commands widespread support and agreement that it should be enacted in time for the election in Northern Ireland to take place as planned on 30th May so that the negotiations may begin on 10th June.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para7"></a>The House will be aware that from the very beginning the Government have been operating to an extraordinarily tight timetable, and I have been more than grateful to your Lordships for the patience and understanding which have been shown in the Government's adumbration of their plans. Equally, I know that some noble Lords will regret that it is necessary for such an important Bill to be taken through all its main stages in this House in a single day. It is a regret that I share.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para8"></a>The House rightly sets great store by its function as a revising Chamber for legislation. Indeed, that is a function that is not obviously compatible with the speedy passage of a Bill. After all, our Standing Orders safeguard our procedures and provide that legislation is customarily considered to a timetable which allows the fullest opportunities for scrutiny. It is only right, therefore, that those Standing Orders should be set aside only by the wish of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para9"></a>I have, however, made it clear, not only this afternoon but on previous occasions, that there is widespread support for the intention to hold elections in Northern Ireland on 30th May. In order for that to be achieved, the necessary powers for the returning officer to make arrangements for polling must be put in place very soon. I hope I am right in thinking that your Lordships would not wish to prevent that timetable being met.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para10"></a>It might also be asked why it was thought necessary to allow longer for consideration of the Bill in another place than is proposed for this House. I hope the reason for that will commend itself to your Lordships as a pragmatic and sensible one under the circumstances. The presence in another place of representatives of all the main Northern Ireland parties whose interests will be directly affected by the provisions of the Bill made it desirable that, of the short overall period available for the parliamentary proceedings, more time should be spent in another place. Perhaps this is a little self-regarding, but I hope your Lordships will acknowledge that I am usually among the first to defend the interests of this House, both as Leader of the House and in a personal capacity. I suggest that on this occasion the particular circumstances of the legislation are such as to make this the most sensible way to proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-03_para11"></a>I have no doubt at all that it will be possible on Thursday for those noble Lords who wish to take part to give the Bill careful consideration. If your Lordships should see fit to amend the Bill, another place will of course consider those amendments in the usual way. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60423-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, my noble friends and I are of course prepared to do anything to facilitate the peace process in Northern Ireland. <P>


<a name="column_1022"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1022</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We support the principle of this Bill and will play our part in carrying it on to the statute book. I understand what the noble Viscount the Leader of the House said about the timetable; namely, the need to hold elections on 30th May so that talks can commence on 10th June. Nevertheless, I must express our serious disquiet about this Motion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para0"></a> As the noble Viscount indicated, this House is a revising Chamber or it is nothing. As he very fairly said, Motions of this sort are not compatible with that position. Yet we face a situation whereby we are confronted with another Business Motion, the second in 20 days, under which we are being asked to suspend our rule that no two stages of a Bill should be taken on a single day--indeed, to pass all stages of the Bill on Thursday of this week. Even the modest proposal that we made that there should be a second day to discuss this matter; namely, Friday of this week, was turned down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para1"></a>The House will recall that we debated a similar procedural Motion relating to the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Bill on only 3rd April. My noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, in indicating that we have no intention of opposing the Bill, nevertheless expressed his concern that the House was to be deprived of the opportunity of discussing it with the degree of care that this House always applies to the consideration of legislation particularly when, as on this occasion, it could affect the interests of many law-abiding members of the public. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, also expressed some of his concerns about the timetable that the House was being asked to accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para2"></a>On that occasion the Government did not find it possible to answer the questions put by both noble Lords. I suspect that they would have been very surprised on that occasion to learn that, even then, the Government were considering proposing a similar procedural Motion on another Bill less than three weeks later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para3"></a>The Government's argument on both occasions has been the same; namely, the need for urgency. Yet it is now clear that the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Bill could have been introduced many weeks earlier. Had that been done, the Bill could have received proper consideration. The same applies to this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para4"></a>As the noble Viscount the Leader of the House indicated a few moments ago, the Prime Minister made a Statement on 21st March which was repeated by the noble Viscount in this House, outlining the electoral process to be followed. Since the Bill, as ultimately published, followed the outlined system so closely, it is my view--and, rather more importantly, the view of my noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham, who is responsible for Northern Ireland policy in my party--that it could have been published and its early stages gone through before the Easter Recess. However, as I have already said, the House will have to consider every stage of this Northern Ireland Bill on Thursday.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para5"></a>We have one day to consider the Bill and, as the noble Viscount the Leader of the House was frank enough to confirm, the House of Commons will have three days. <P>


<a name="column_1023"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1023</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I am bound to say that I did not find the explanation he gave as to why there should be that remarkable distinction all that persuasive. Of course, there are Ulster Unionists and others in the House of Commons who wish to discuss the Bill in detail; and of course we understand the parliamentary arithmetic of the present House of Commons. Nevertheless, it seems more than mildly surprising that a House that sees itself as a revising Chamber should have one day to consider the Bill whereas the House of Commons is to have three.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para6"></a>On matters of this sort we are very much in the hands of the Leader of the House. Following a similar dispute some years ago on a similar procedural Motion relating to another Bill, the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, intervened and insisted that this House should be given more time to consider the Bill. That was done. I am extremely sorry that similar action has not been taken on this occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para7"></a>The problem is a simple one. The overwhelming majority of Ministers sit in the House of Commons. Inevitably, their principal concern is to meet the interests of Members of the House of Commons. I do not think that they apply their minds a great deal as to how this House will react to a restricted timetable. Indeed, when my colleague, Mr. Alan Beith, was consulted by the Home Secretary on the contents of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, the matter of its consideration by this House was not even raised by Mr. Howard. Similarly, it was not raised when this Bill was first discussed with my noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham. It came up only later when it was learnt that some of us were very unhappy about the arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para8"></a>I hope that the noble Viscount the Leader of the House understands our serious disquiet about the manner in which this House is being treated. If the House wishes to maintain its reputation as a serious House of Parliament, which is the last bastion of protection of the public interest against unreasonable behaviour by the Executive, it cannot afford simply to accept in a mood of humble acquiescence Business Motions of this character. I hope that the noble Viscount will register our concern and do his best to meet it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the unhappiest Member of the House is the noble Viscount the Leader of the House, who has had to come before us with this procedure. As he himself said, it would not be his wish in normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances. The noble Viscount will be aware that when the proposition was put to us our reaction was not overwhelmingly to accept it, but to recognise that this is a serious matter, not only in the context of the Bill, but in relation to the stature of this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para9"></a>Discussions have taken place. Among those with whom I discussed the matter was the spokesman for Northern Ireland matters on this side of the House, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. Unhappy as he was that we were being invited to agree to the procedure, his first reaction was that, if it could be done, then he would not stand against completing it in one day. But the Leader of the House should recognise that it is not a normal day. It is not a normal Thursday. <P>


<a name="column_1024"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1024</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We need to conclude reasonably early because we are meeting on Friday. In addition, an important Unstarred Question remains on the Order Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para10"></a>While no one would want to inhibit any Member from using the opportunities that may present themselves during the day, a tough point might be reached at a time when it may be recognised that it would be detrimental to attempt to proceed with what the House will agree to today. In those circumstances I hope that the usual channels, who will be present at the appropriate time, could meet to resolve how best to deal with the remaining stages. Let us hope that they are reached in good order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para11"></a>It may be that at 9 o'clock, 9.30 or 10 o'clock we would need to make a judgment. In those circumstances it is not unreasonable to ask the House to agree to the terms of the Motion. However, the Leader of the House ought to be aware that the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, are good House of Lords points. If anything can be done to give earlier notice and to be more generous with time, that would be to the benefit of the House and to the Leader of the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I support the sensible suggestion of my noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton, that should debate on the Bill proceed at some length on Thursday, the Leader of the House might see fit to arrange for the debate to be concluded on the Friday. The whole House will recognise that that would be a sensible way of responding to a difficult situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para12"></a>I wonder whether I might ask the Leader of the House to provide us with more information regarding the timetable of events. I am thinking, in particular, of the deadline to be met to enable the electoral process to commence in good time. This House, and the whole of Parliament, needs a clear idea of when Parliament has to conclude its deliberations on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-04_para13"></a>We all recognise the difficult situation that exists regarding the Government's negotiations on Northern Ireland. We all hope that the discussions will be concluded successfully. We need to recognise that for that to happen the negotiations need to continue on the basis of mutual respect among all parties. One of the difficulties that we are faced with is the way that the Government are constraining parliamentary consideration of the Bill. It suggests that the Government have some contempt, some lack of respect, for the very institutions of their own Parliament. I hope that in his explanation of the constraints of the timetable, the Leader of the House will demonstrate that the Government have taken all possible steps to ensure that there is adequate time available for parliamentary scrutiny of this important Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, I should like to ask another slight timetabling question of my noble friend, the Leader of the House, because it is quite obvious that the House will want to put down amendments to the Bill as, indeed, it did to the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Bill which, as we have heard, we passed the other day through all its stages in one day. On that occasion the powers that be arranged for a <P>

The House adjourned during pleasure for the issue of manuscript amendments, and again, if my memory serves me right, between the Committee stage and the Report stage. Will my noble friend the Leader of the House say whether that will be the case on Thursday, as it was with the previous Bill?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-05_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, for his support for the policy, which has never been in doubt either from himself or, indeed, from the party which he represents. Equally I am delighted to try to reassure him--I am sure under the circumstances, in view of his remark, somewhat inadequately--that I wholly support his contention that this is a serious House of Parliament. I think that that was the phrase he used. It is a phrase that I have used, in particular, in response to various inquiries in a similar vein over the past few months from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, who also sought my reassurance along the same lines.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para0"></a>Looking at the timetable which has been pursued, both in another place and here, in terms of the Government's legislative programme, I have no doubt that if the noble Lord, Lord Harris, looks, which I know he does, at the amount of time given to consideration of the Government's mainstream legislative programme--though it may not perhaps be particularly tactful on my part to remind another place of this--he will see that your Lordships' House can take a certain amount of pride in the serious consideration and thorough examination accorded those Bills brought forward by Her Majesty's Government in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para1"></a>At the risk of perhaps sounding more than usually patronising on the subject, I believe that your Lordships deserve congratulation on that. My noble friend, the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, has been under some pressure, because of your Lordships' insistence on scrutinising the Government's legislation, somehow to begin to live up to the timetable which he had intimated to our colleagues that your Lordships would be able to sustain during the course of the current Session. I hope that that, at least, will give, in the generality if not in this particular, some reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, who I think it may be fairly said has played more than his usual part, even by his high standards, in ensuring that so far the generality of the Government's legislation has received its proper scrutiny in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para2"></a>It is fair to say that this is, indeed, an exceptional case. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Harris, will realise that after the Statement to which he referred, and the Statement that I repeated in your Lordships' House on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, there was necessarily a period of consultation with the Northern Ireland parties. It was important to see whether it would be possible for a mutually agreed election system to emerge from that consultation. As it turned out, it proved to be impossible to agree that. Under those circumstances, as foreseen in the original Statement, Her Majesty's Government had to decide what was likely to be the most acceptable compromise. That is what we <P>


<a name="column_1026"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1026</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have endeavoured to produce. That has inevitably taken time. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, will recognise that since we had already, with the approval of his party, and, in particular, his noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham, set a date for elections--a date that was requested by the Dublin Government--it would be sensible for us to try to achieve whatever timetable seemed the most expedient, even at the expense, which I recognise, of proper scrutiny in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para3"></a>I hope your Lordships will forgive me for having taken so long, but the objection of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, as he recognised, is a serious one. I resist it only with the greatest of reluctance, as I hope I made clear during the course of my opening remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para4"></a>I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, for his suggestion, which was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. If your Lordships were to agree, I think that it would be extremely sensible, should it become apparent during the course of next Thursday's proceedings that proper examination of the Bill could not be concluded in the time available, that perhaps the usual channels should take counsel together and give further thought to how the Bill could subsequently be considered. The noble Lord pointed out that the House will be considering other matters on Friday and that there is an opportunity there. I am grateful to him for that suggestion, if the House will go along with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, and, in a slightly different context, my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale asked some timetabling questions. In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, this legislation has to be on the statute book by the end of the present month if the returning officer in Northern Ireland is to have the time to perform his task according to statute. Therefore, I hope that he will accept that we are under considerable time constraints in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para6"></a>I can best answer my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale by telling him that since the Bill is expected to be passed by another place some time on the evening of Tuesday, 23rd April--that is, today--a text of the Bill will be available in the Printed Paper Office on the morning of Wednesday, 24th April--that is, tomorrow--in a form passed by the other place. If the other place sits late and the Bill is unamended, then the Bill in the Printed Paper Office tomorrow morning will be another place's print of the Bill. Otherwise, arrangements will be made for a House of Lords' print of the Bill to be available. But in either case, the Bill as printed by this House will be available in the usual form on the morning of Thursday, 25th April.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para7"></a>It might be for the convenience of your Lordships if I also add that the Public Bill Office will accept amendments in advance of the Second Reading of the Bill, should any of your Lordships wish to put down any amendments. Until any Lords' Bill is available, any amendments should as a matter of convenience relate to the print of the Bill coming from another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para8"></a>The provisional list of any amendments received will be placed in the Printed Paper Office on the morning of 24th April and supplemented or replaced as necessary. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>A provisional Marshalled List will be available in the Printed Paper Office on the morning of 25th April and a Marshalled List will be available from 2.30 p.m. Any further amendments tabled before the conclusion of the Second Reading debate will be circulated as manuscript amendments on separate sheets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Viscount sits down, perhaps I may clarify one point; namely, if any part of the Bill remains unattended to on Thursday, Friday may be the obvious time to deal with it. However, when the usual channels meet, there may be other circumstances, of which I am not aware, to indicate that, in view of the fact that the noble Viscount has said that the deadline is Tuesday, the remainder of the Bill could be dealt with in this House if not on Friday then on Monday or Tuesday of next week. If it is not possible to deal with the Bill on Thursday and any part of the Bill which is left must be dealt with on Friday, then so be it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-05_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I am sure that the noble Lord will understand that it will be difficult to go beyond Friday. I am grateful to him for accepting that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, perhaps my noble friend would deal with one point. If the discussion of the Bill is taken on Friday, that will diminish the time available for discussion of the Finance Bill, which is set down for Friday. As your Lordships know, some noble Lords feel that it is a great pity that the most important Bill of the year should in any case be debated on Friday. I ask my noble friend to say that, if the Northern Ireland Bill obtrudes into Friday, then another separate day in the following week will be found for the Finance Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-05_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I hope and believe that my noble friend raises an entirely hypothetical question which we may not need to address. I keep my fingers crossed that we shall not need to do so, but if the situation envisaged by the Opposition Chief Whip arises on Thursday, clearly we shall have to bear that point in mind. I hope that my noble friend will accept my assurance that we shall do so.

<A NAME = "60423-05_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: During the Second Reading debate, I agreed to reflect on the criticism made by my noble friend Lord Renton, and agreed to by others, of the drafting of Clause 1. Clause 1 operates by amending paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the 1993 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para16"></a>As I said at Second Reading, it is not practicable always to proceed by re-enacting the provisions of previous statutes in a revised form. Nevertheless, we accept that, as a result of government amendments made at Report in another place, Clause 1 is now particularly difficult to read. We therefore propose to replace Clause 1 with a new version which re-enacts paragraph 5, with the amendments we proposed incorporated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-05_para17"></a>I ought also to record that Amendment No. 1 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 24A, 25A and 26. It is my intention to respond to them after they have been presented by the proposers. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  The amendment proposed is to leave out Clause 1 and insert the new clause as printed on the Marshalled List. I call Amendment No. 2, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, and Lord McIntosh of Haringey.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I wonder whether it would be better if we were to follow what my noble friend Lady Blatch indicated and obtain agreement about the replacement of Clause 1 in the way that she proposed, before we consider any amendments that we might make to the replacement clause.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I should like to support that suggestion. We do not wish to take a final decision on Amendment No. 1, as clearly that cannot be done until Amendments Nos. 2 to 30 have been considered and decided upon one way or another. Particular amendments have been grouped with Amendment No. 1 because they refer to the only substantive changes which the Government have made to the clause in the course of the redrafting exercise. If it were for the convenience of the Committee, I should like to speak to my amendments which have been grouped with Amendment No. 1 before going on to propose Amendment No. 2.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. Perhaps I should just indicate, for the convenience of the Committee, that it would be the normal procedure to deal with the amendment in the way in which I have just put the Question. But, as always, it is in the hands of the Committee and, if it is for the better convenience of the Committee to deal with it in that way, of course it is not for the Chairman to stand in the way of such a proposal.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, the Chairman, for that observation. Clearly, I only speak to the grouped amendments rather than move them. They will be reached in due course.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para0"></a>I am grateful to the Government for taking account of the objections which the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and I, and others, raised to the drafting of Clause 1. I was so confused--I will not say incensed--by Clause 1 as drafted that I went away immediately and redrafted it in the terms which have now appeared on the Marshalled List. I am glad to see that, apart from a minor question of numbering, my interpretation of what Clause 1 did to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 of the 1993 Act was correct. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, had also taken the initiative of preparing a new version of Clause 1 as a Keeling schedule which was, I have no doubt, a more appropriate way of dealing with it than the way in which I dealt with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para1"></a>We now have Amendment No. 1 on the Marshalled List and we can now deal with amendments to it properly and seriously. We are grateful to the Government for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para2"></a>This is an opportunity to refer to the substantive change which the Government have made by way of subsections (7) and (8) of Amendment No. 1. The Committee will recall that the original Clause 1 provided that the order designating countries under what is commonly called the white list should come into effect using the negative resolution procedure. The Committee will also recall that, as was referred to on Second Reading, the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee criticised the procedure and said that the affirmative resolution procedure was more appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para3"></a>I am glad to see that the Government have taken some account of that and that they have continued their welcome practice of taking serious note of what the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee says and, on the whole, of incorporating its conclusions into legislation. However, they have not applied the affirmative resolution procedure to all orders under this clause, but only to the first order made under the paragraph. Subsequent orders are to be made by annulment; in other words, by the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para4"></a>The procedure that is proposed is unsatisfactory in two ways. First, it is unsatisfactory that only the first order should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. It is a terrible temptation for any government to use the first order only to put on the list those countries, if there are any, about which there is no controversy and to leave the more controversial countries to subsequent orders, which will have a lesser level of parliamentary scrutiny. There are some indications from leaked documents that that may be the case, so the status of countries added to the list is surely no different whether they are added now or later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para5"></a>Secondly, the Government's proposals are too prescriptive. They allow for too much parliamentary scrutiny in uncontroversial cases involving when a country might be removed from the list. A country might be removed from the list when, for example, through a coup d'etat, other internal disturbances or any serious, changed political circumstances, such as the outbreak of civil war or anything of that sort, it suddenly becomes dangerous, so that applications for asylum might justifiably be made and be made very quickly. <P>


<a name="column_1031"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1031</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In such circumstances it is surely important that the Government should have the power to remove that country from the list very quickly. I suggest that it is appropriate for that to be done not by a negative resolution procedure, which would take 40 days or whatever, but by administrative order by the Secretary of State. There is no need for parliamentary scrutiny when we are looking for swift protection for those who are at risk of persecution or torture in their own countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para6"></a>The proposed amendment to the clause is unsatisfactory in two ways. It does not provide for enough parliamentary scrutiny where parliamentary scrutiny is needed, and it provides for too much scrutiny when the prime need is for direct action. It is for those reasons that we are not satisfied with this amendment to the clause which has been made in the course of the redrafting. We hope that the Government will reconsider the way in which they have approached this issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord gave the impression that we have not gone as far as the Scrutiny Committee invited. We have fully accepted the recommendations of the Scrutiny Committee; putting to its members the case why there should not be affirmative resolution of subsequent additions; they accepted our case and we have accepted their recommendation in full.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_time0"></A><H5>3.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I did not mean to suggest they had not. I meant to suggest that the result is still unsatisfactory.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   These amendments were originally tabled in my name. They were intended, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said, as an attempt to involve the affirmative resolution procedure for every order--not just for the first order, but for all subsequent orders also. May I briefly add to what has already been said about the reasons for these amendments?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para7"></a>We know that the Bill suggests that people who satisfy certain conditions shall be subject to a fast-track procedure. One of those conditions is that they come from a country which, in general, is not likely to persecute them. There are certain other conditions that we shall be discussing later in today's debate which concern, for example, the lack of a passport, or possession of an invalid passport or invalid papers, or other factors which suggest that an appeal for asylum status might be fraudulent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para8"></a>I turn now to the provisions on the so-called white list. The Government are suggesting that those who come from countries on the white list, countries not normally associated with persecution, will be subjected to a fast-track procedure which is a very fast-track procedure indeed. It would involve 10 days in total for the consideration of an application and seven days for its preparation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para9"></a>What is more troubling is that that might be associated with what is called "the immediate arrival procedure", which means that in future asylum seekers may be interviewed on the day of their arrival. <P>


<a name="column_1032"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1032</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Somebody coming into this country seeking asylum from, say, a country like Pakistan or Ghana would have an immediate interview, possibly within hours of his or her arrival, and would then have seven days in which to prepare a case. As far as we know, the only information about the procedure for preparing a case is in a leaflet, provided by the Home Office in the English language only. Many of those seeking asylum will not speak English. One might say that probably most will not. They are therefore at a huge disadvantage. They are unlikely to have the time to find people to help them. They are supposed to produce evidence within seven days. Those who are victims of torture will find obtaining adequate medical evidence in a short period of time next door to impossible. Those, the most serious of all asylum seekers, may be the worst off under the fast-track procedure. Therefore, we have tabled this amendment in the hope that each of those cases will be considered separately and carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para10"></a>I do not want to make much reference to countries on the so-called white list because many of them are countries in the Commonwealth, but I am obliged to refer to two, one on the white list and one not. The country on the white list at the present time to which I am referring is Pakistan, a close friend of this country and a country with many things to its credit, but one of the things not to its credit is its record on human rights. There is a great deal of evidence most recently from Amnesty International's report on Pakistan for 1994-95 to say that torture and other forms of inhuman treatment are still quite frequently used in Pakistan. Amnesty International documents 67 cases in 1994 through to the end of that year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para11"></a>In addition, there is a specific level of persecution directed at those who have a religion other than that of mainstream Islam; namely, Awami Moslems and Christians. Awami Moslems and Christians in certain areas of Pakistan are subject to considerable persecution, sometimes amounting to torture and other inhuman behaviour, and yet that country is on the white list at the present time. Frankly, once a country is on the white list it is not easy to take it off, though it raises difficult diplomatic problems for our Government which would be clearly overcome if the matter was subject to Parliament. It is easier for this House or another place to raise questions about the white list status of another country than it is for Her Majesty's Government to do so because it does not arouse the same diplomatic problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para12"></a>The other country to which I want to refer briefly is no longer on the white list. There were rumours that it might have been. The noble Baroness may tell us that that is not so, in which case I do not want to suggest it. I am referring to Nigeria where, currently, people who worship as Christians are under the most extreme forms of pressure and persecution, as many right reverend Prelates in this Chamber will know. Most recently the case arose of a man who, while attempting to conduct a church service, was seized, taken into custody, so seriously beaten that he was almost unable to retain his reason afterwards and only with a great deal of difficulty and by bribery was able to leave the country. In the past <P>


<a name="column_1033"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1033</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>some of those people have been returned to their countries of origin, with well attested cases of extreme pressure being brought to bear upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para13"></a>Because I do not want to delay the Committee, let me say that the purpose of Amendments Nos. 24A and 25A--amendments which will make all orders subject to affirmative procedure--is to allow this Chamber to consider with care and in detail the case for putting countries on the so-called white list. The arguments in relation to the other sub-paragraphs which relate to invalid passports and fraudulent papers are subject to being upheld.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-06_para14"></a>It is my concluding thought that it is one of the fundamental obligations of this place in upholding the traditions of this country as a beacon of liberty throughout the world to ensure that every last man or woman who wishes to worship freely, who wishes to stand up for freedom in his or her own country, is treated as genuine. We should therefore have procedures which do not allow us to negate their appeal if they are among those who deserve to be asylum seekers; they are heroes in their own country and we should respect them.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before dealing with the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, I should like to refer to the Government's replacement of Clause 1 and say how much I welcome it. As it stands in the Bill, the present Clause 1 is a notorious example of legislation by reference. It would have taken hours to go through all the previous legislation and redraft the clause in our own mind. Attempting to understand amendments to it would have been formidable. I am grateful to my noble friend as, I am sure, are others.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh said, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, drafted a Keeling schedule which would have been extremely valuable. But of the two alternatives--the one the Government have chosen and the Keeling schedule--the Government's choice is the better.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para1"></a>Though I disagree with the amendments tabled to the new Clause 1, we are now able to understand them. We would have had an awful time disentangling their effects if the new clause had not been introduced. In the broad, what the grouped amendments seek to do is fairly straightforward. I draw attention to the fact that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, have different methods of dealing with the situation. I do not believe that there is much difference between their methods and that of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para2"></a>I was fascinated by the complaint of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, that there would be too much parliamentary consideration which may involve delay. It is unusual to hear the Opposition complaining that Parliament is being given too great an opportunity. I hope that, on consideration, he will not press that view.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para3"></a>I was rather surprised to hear the designated countries referred to as "white" countries; that could be misunderstood. However, if we are to have designated countries, we must give careful consideration as to which countries should be designated and which should <P>


<a name="column_1034"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1034</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cease to be designated. The feelings not only of the governments, but also of the peoples in each of the countries concerned are extremely sensitive in relation to whether or not they are included on the list. We must not rush the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para4"></a>I prefer the Government's method of dealing with the situation. It gives a certain flexibility and opportunity for quick action. Annulments can be obtained, if there is a will to expedite, without waiting 40 days, which is the maximum period allowed. That may give some consolation to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. However, on the whole question of allowing immigrants into this country perhaps I can make a broad point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para5"></a>There are too many countries in this world in which there is too much oppression affecting not merely a few thousand people, but many hundreds of thousands of people and perhaps more. To say that we ourselves, among all the countries of the world, will be the most hospitable, the kindest and the most receptive of all those who are oppressed in their own countries, will lead to this country being flooded beyond what is reasonable for the people who already live here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para6"></a>I address those remarks--with the deepest respect because I am a churchman--to the right reverend Prelates on the episcopal Bench. I understand their feelings as Christians. But we have a duty to be sensible in this matter and not to allow a flood of immigrants to deprive our own people of some of the government services and financial help to which they are entitled. That is what will happen if we are over-benign in this important matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-07_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   First, I join with the noble Lord, Lord Renton, in relation to the drafting of this clause. I also thank him for his remarks at Second Reading on that point, to which I believe the Government listened.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para7"></a>The changes which have been introduced are very much in the spirit of the Renton Report on the preparation of legislation, to which we are all indebted. Therefore, in thanking the Government, I thank the noble Lord also.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para8"></a>I am also happy to confirm what the noble Baroness said; that is, that the Government have adopted the changes recommended by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, for which I thank them. I thank the committee also; we are always deeply in the debt of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. It does a job for which the House is very much the richer. I am happy to say that it is beginning to make us the envy of another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para9"></a>However, it is fair to say that there is no committee in the House with which any of us will agree on absolutely every point. The procedure that the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee has recommended for the first order referred to in the Bill is the affirmative procedure. The Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee is expert on procedure. However, inevitably, it cannot be deeply expert in the subject matter of every single Bill that comes before it. I say that without the least suggestion of criticism because it cannot possibly be otherwise.
<P>


<a name="column_1035"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1035</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para10"></a>The affirmative procedure which the Committee has recommended for the first order is appropriate for a case where there is doubt in the mind of the House as to how the powers will be used in a general procedural way. I think I am right in saying that there is very little doubt in the mind of the House on that point. It is all too clear exactly what it is intended these powers should do. The doubt which will arise in respect of orders under this clause is a rather different one. It is a doubt about the appropriateness of the Home Office's assessment of the country concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para11"></a>Before I deal with that point I should like to refer to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, about numbers. It is not appreciated as widely as it should be that in the past year the number of people leaving this country exceeded those entering it by 5,000, and of those entering the country 30 per cent. were British subjects returning home. Therefore, the question of a flood of applicants--whatever one may think about it--for the time being must remain hypothetical.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_time0"></A><H5>4 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am reluctant to interrupt the noble Earl, but it is important to get this straight. The noble Earl is dealing with the situation as it is now; the amendments deal with the future and, potentially, will increase the number of people seeking asylum here by a very considerable amount. The comings and goings in the past are interesting, yes, but it is necessary to consider what will be the effect of these amendments on comings and goings.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-07_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   These amendments would extend the ability to make an application to what the Government believed to be appropriate in 1993. I do not believe that in 1993 the Government were quite as careless of this point as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has suggested. He has, however, by his intervention, given me a moment to find some figures that I was trying to lay my hands on.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para12"></a>A Written Answer which I received from the noble Baroness last December gives the number of applicants per million of population. Those were: the United Kingdom, 1,000; the Netherlands, 1,900; Germany, 2,100. Therefore, it would be a mistake to suggest that if there is a flood we are in any way unique in being its recipients. There are others who are receiving, and indeed accepting, a great many more applicants than we are.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para13"></a>One can go too far on the hypothetical principle. It always used to cause my father intense panic that although we could know that the sun had not exploded seven minutes ago we could not know it had not exploded now. That always struck me as a little theoretical, and so, frankly, does that intervention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para14"></a>We are concerned here with the Home Office's assessments of countries. Designations for the list--and I share the reservations of the noble Lord, Lord Renton about calling it a white list--will depend on the assessment of the Home Office as to how safe a particular country is. Since, also, in dealing with asylum claims, people are sometimes taken to be lying because they do not share the assessment of the Home Office about the safety of the country, it is important that there <P>


<a name="column_1036"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1036</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be parliamentary input into assessing the accuracy of the designation, especially as there are many people--some of them present in the Chamber now--who have a depth of knowledge of other countries to which the Home Office collectively does not aspire.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para15"></a>For example, in the case of Turkey the Home Office wrote in a refusal letter:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Turkish Government is exploring ways of allowing greater expression to the Kurdish cultural identity". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That may cause great surprise to my noble friend Lord Avebury.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para16"></a>Take the case of Nigeria, to which my noble friend Lady Williams referred. Another Home Office refusal letter stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There have been no reports of persecution or atrocities against the civilian population". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I really must say, "tell that to the Prime Minister". The Prime Minister--and I heard him myself--described the death of Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa as "murder committed with the sword of justice". I have listened in this Chamber to the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker of Wallasey, replying to a Private Notice Question from the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, that that was not the Foreign Office's assessment of Nigeria. I cannot help thinking that the Foreign Office is rather more competent to assess the safety of foreign countries than what is, by definition, a "home" office.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para17"></a>Take the case of Zaire. Another refusal letter states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State is satisfied that these factors and the continuing inter-party negotiations strongly suggest that opposition parties are allowed to function freely". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not the account of Zaire that I hear from most quarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-07_para18"></a>It is important that we in this House should discover what the assessments of countries are and should be able to give them critical scrutiny. For that reason I support these amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-08_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   I too would like to offer my thanks to the Government for the redrafting of Clause 1, which now stands in a very much better form. I also welcome subparagraph (7) which allows for an affirmative order in the initial determination of those countries which are to be designated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para0"></a>However, I must question the logic of an affirmative procedure for the first order but not for subsequent orders. Both the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, have pointed out the importance of scrutiny of any countries which go on this list. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, made the same point. If it is important that they are scrutinised under the first order surely it is equally important that at any subsequent stage countries which go on the list should be subject to the most careful consideration by this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para1"></a>The amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, has my support for that reason. I cannot understand an argument which says that scrutiny is important in the one case but not in other cases. It is perfectly possible that the Government will, at a future stage, want to place a country on the designated list. There may be a number of reasons for <P>


<a name="column_1037"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1037</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that. One reason could be that the number of applications for asylum from that country have a high level of rejection. That is one possible reason for a country being included on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para2"></a>For precisely the reasons given by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, it is important that in those cases a country should receive very careful scrutiny. I would hope that the Committee would look very carefully at the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and ask why there should be this distinction between the first order and any subsequent orders. While I am on my feet, perhaps I may respond to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, not least because some of them were addressed to this Bench. I speak with the greatest respect for the noble Lord who served with distinction in another place for a constituency in which I served as archdeacon. Therefore, we have many shared experiences from that time. I ask him to reconsider the use of the word "flood" to which the noble Earl, Lord Russell, has already made reference. The figures that I have in front of me of applications for 1995 show that some 27,000 applications were decided, of which 21,300 were rejected, leaving (if my arithmetic is right) some 5,700 which were accepted--that is to say, granted either full recognition of refugee status or given exceptional leave to remain. I cannot accept that a figure of 5,700 in one year can in any way be regarded as a flood. I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is making that we need to look at the effects of this legislation on future numbers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para3"></a>The anxiety of this Bench, as I know of others in the Chamber, is that this legislation should continue to afford the most careful scrutiny to every applicant for asylum. That is the heart of our anxiety. We do not believe that this legislation in any way is going to open floodgates: if anything, it is closing such gates as they are, a little more tightly. Our anxiety about this is that the most careful consideration should be given to each individual case. If we express resistance to certain clauses in this Bill, it is on those grounds.

<A NAME="60423-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My noble friend Lord Russell tempted me to intervene in this debate by mentioning two countries in which the Parliamentary Human Rights Group (of which I have the honour to be chairman) have taken a particular interest, and they are Turkey and Nigeria. I have visited Turkey on four occasions in the past five years until the Turkish Government banned me from entering the country in August 1994. I have been unable to get back there since despite writing to the new Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz who is credited with a greater degree of transparency by the Government, as exemplified by the quotation from the letter which my noble friend read out in which the Home Office claimed that the Turkish Government were exploring ways of extending greater cultural identity or privileges to the Kurdish minority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para4"></a>I sent an analysis to the Minister in the other place, Mr. David Davis, who deals with Turkey, drawing his attention to the similarity between the remarks that were <P>


<a name="column_1038"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1038</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made by Mr. Yilmaz when he presented his government's programme to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, and the remarks that were made by his predecessor, Mrs. Tansu Ciller in her speech to the Turkish Grand National Assembly on 30th June 1993. I asked him whether he thought that it was more or less likely that Mr. Yilmaz would be able to give effect to the undertaking which he had given; for example, on freedom of expression and greater observance of human rights, than Mrs. Ciller had when her Government possessed a majority in the Grand National Assembly, whereas Mr. Yilmaz, who is dependent on the votes of the two Opposition parties of Mr. Ecevit and, the largest of all the parties; namely, that of Mr. Erbakan, the Islamist Welfare Party, neither of which are particularly disposed towards the liberal parts of the government's programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para5"></a>The opposite is happening. Writers are still being imprisoned, and on 31st May one of the largest trials ever of intellectuals is taking place at the state security court in Istanbul, where 94 writers and intellectuals are to be put on trial for thought-crime offences. Mr. Yasar Kemal, the most famous writer in Turkey, was recently on trial; Mr. Besikci, has had extra years of imprisonment added to those already imposed on him. At yesterday evening's meeting of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, we heard from two very distinguished intellectuals from Turkey, Mr. Haluk Gerger, the writer, and Mr. Yurdatapan, who has recently been down in the south-east of Turkey investigating the present situation there.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para6"></a>He spoke in particular about an incident in which 11 people were murdered in a minibus, which is alleged by the Turkish authorities to have been committed by the PKK, the armed opposition. But on investigation, it turned out to be almost certain that it was committed by the state security forces themselves. I shall not go into detail about the evidence, but it is fairly substantial. I believe that it is going to be presented to the European Convention on Human Rights by some of the next-of-kin, who, very courageously, attended press conferences and who gave evidence to Mr. Yurdatapan.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para7"></a>So very far from Turkish human rights showing any sign of improvement, it is in fact deteriorating. I personally cannot understand why, if one looks at the figures of Turkish asylum seekers coming to the United Kingdom, the rate of refusal has increased from 6 per cent. in 1990, to 92 per cent. in 1995 and that is without any designation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para8"></a>What are we to do? Are we to say that nobody from Turkey is ever going to be granted asylum here irrespective of the nature and extent of the violation of human rights in that country? I shall certainly be devastated if there is an intention of putting Turkey on the list for designation. I hope that the noble Baroness can assure us that the Government have no such intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para9"></a>I now turn to Nigeria, which is the other country which my noble friend mentioned. I was equally astonished that there was ever any intention of putting Nigeria on to the list except that we knew from the internal briefing document which had been produced by <P>


<a name="column_1039"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1039</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Home Office for assessing applications by persons coming from Nigeria, how far short of reality its perception was in looking at the political and human rights condition of the country. There were so many glaring omissions in the document which we pointed out to the Home Office, and as a result, it was withdrawn and replaced by one which was slightly more accurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para10"></a>If one is going to produce documents of that kind, it would be better to look at the experience of other countries who seem to be more efficient at it than we are, particularly the Canadians and Americans, whose documents are always well referenced, whereas those from the Home Office are full of mere assertions and generalities. I appeal to the noble Baroness, quite separately from this debate, to have a look at the matter and to see whether, if the Home Office is to give advice of this kind, it should be based on much more accurate assessment of the human rights conditions in the countries of origin which, as my noble friend said, is more reliable when it comes from the Foreign Office than from the noble Baroness's department. I cannot understand why it is not possible for information to be transferred across in that way or why the noble Baroness and her department cannot look at some of the evidence which is available from other sources, such as the US State Department, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para11"></a>In Nigeria at the moment we have a situation where not only have very serious human rights violations been taking place, but when the Commonwealth attempts to send a group of very distinguished Ministers to see General Abacha to discuss these matters with him, he refuses to admit the delegation. The British High Commissioner returned to Abuja at the end of January. He has not seen the Head of State since that point, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, told the meeting of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group the other day. I believe that none of the other representatives of the European Union gets to see General Abacha. He does not want to listen to representations on human rights. I understand that the only British authority who has been able to get an audience with him since the beginning of this year was the local representative of Shell. That tells one something about the relationship between that company and the Nigerian regime.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-08_para12"></a>I entirely share the view that the powers that we are granting here to put any country on the designation list are extraordinarily broad, and we should safeguard the position of the House and another place by looking very carefully at these proposals if they come before Parliament in future. If Turkey or Nigeria were ever considered to be suitable countries for designation, I would certainly wish to be here and to speak extensively on that subject.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps I may say a brief word on procedure. Clearly, I have caused some trouble by grouping my later amendments with this one. My intention in grouping Amendment No. 26 with Amendment No. 1 was to draw attention to the only point where the redrafting of the amendment had been substantially changed. It was my intention to persuade your Lordships that we should debate now only the <P>


<a name="column_1040"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1040</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>redrafting of Clause 1 and the issue of parliamentary scrutiny. All the other issues which noble Lords have debated, with the exception (I am glad to say) of the right reverend Prelate, can much better be debated in later amendments. I suggest humbly to the Committee that, having made this mistake, it would now be best for the Minister to wind up on those two issues.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Does the noble Lord understand that the points we have been making necessarily arise from what we see as the insufficient nature of the Government's concession on the affirmative procedure?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not believe that I do. I believe that the noble Earl has, very properly and honourably, moved on to substantive issues relating to Clause 1 which can be debated in considering later amendments or that Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill. I am afraid that on this occasion I do not agree with the noble Earl. But I have caused confusion by the grouping that has been agreed, and therefore I am utterly humble about this matter. I suggest that when other noble Lords have said what they wish to say about those two issues, it is better for the Minister to wind up on those matters and to move straight on to Amendment No. 2. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Renton has said, neither I nor the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has moved any amendments. We cannot do so. Only one amendment is before the Committee, and that is Amendment No. 1.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Shepherd: </B>   As a member of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, I should like to speak in response to what has fallen from the noble Earl.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para0"></a>The support received by that committee from every quarter of the Chamber is very helpful in its approach to what may occasionally be complicated and difficult legislation. The fact that now the Government more often accept its proposals is even more gratifying. The committee has to operate within a very short period of time. Following Second Reading, the committee obtains the first memorandum from the department and has to put it before the House within two or three days of the Committee stage. Therefore, it is not able to look at the Bill in very great detail. It can go only to the heart of what concerns it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para1"></a> In this particular case, what concerned the committee was the very wide power sought by the Secretary of State. The policy of the Bill is not a matter that enters into the deliberations of that committee. Therefore, the kinds of points raised by the right reverend Prelate do not enter into the thinking of that committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para2"></a>When the committee looked at the Bill, apart from the powers, it wanted to know what it ought to say to the Chamber. That committee reports to this Chamber, not the Government. The Government have responded on the basis that the noble Baroness is a Member of the House and no doubt has been able to obtain a copy. But it is a report to the Chamber, not the final word. Noble Lords who are members of that committee can vote according to their views as a consequence of the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para3"></a>The reason why the affirmative procedure was recommended in regard to the initiation of first orders was that at least the Chamber would have some idea of <P>


<a name="column_1041"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1041</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the countries that would be placed on one list or another. If there are additions, on that basis one may say that an affirmative order should equally follow. We thought that, having established the basic principles, that would be enough. However, I remind your Lordships that that committee was reporting to this Chamber. It seems to me that over the years there has not been much difference between the affirmative and negative procedures. Here, one can obtain a negative procedure debate fairly quickly. I am not aware of any occasion when the business managers have found reasons to prevent a debate subject to the negative procedure. Of course, in another place the position is very different. It is not for the committee to do anything in regard to procedures in the House of Commons. As far as concerns this Chamber, the negative and affirmative procedures are basically the same in terms of debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para4"></a>The fundamental problem that has become clear in this Bill is that whatever one does between the negative procedure and the affirmative procedure, one will not be able to amend the measure. For example, one will not be able to remove Nigeria, Pakistan or Turkey from one list. One will have to reject the whole order in order to eliminate one country. I can see grave difficulties in terms of relationships with some countries who we recognise do not have as good a procedure as we have in order to deal with their problems but progress is being made. We do not wish to aggravate it perhaps by asking a Minister to say something that might put our friends in those countries at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para5"></a>I wonder whether, before an order is made in this Chamber, the matter should be sent to a committee appointed by the Leader of the House. It will take evidence why the names are on the list, satisfy itself as to that matter, and report to the Chamber that it has conducted an investigation whether those countries should go on the list. I believe that the procedure for debate, be it affirmative or negative, will prove to be very difficult, certainly to get to the truth. In view of our great history, I believe that we should look at a procedure whereby these matters, which may be very delicate, can be considered quietly and perhaps in privacy, with a report to the Chamber on its views on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para6"></a>I shall support this matter. I believe that whatever is done in this field should be done with as much parliamentary surveillance as possible. But one recognises that whatever one does, one will be hamstrung. One may have a debate and speak one's mind, but at the end of the day if the Government will it, the particular order will be passed, whether it should or should not. If a committee were appointed by the Leader to look at these matters, perhaps not too formally, we would be discharging our duty to a greater extent than is now proposed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dean of Harptree: </B>   I also welcome the new clause, in particular subsections (7) and (8), which have just been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd. I am also a member of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. I find it encouraging that the Government have accepted in toto the recommendations made by that committee.
<P>


<a name="column_1042"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1042</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para7"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon said he did not understand the logic of adopting the affirmative procedure for the first list and the negative procedure for any changes. I suggest that there is very good logic here. One is dealing with the concept of designated countries that move into a fairly new area. It is important that this Chamber should have an opportunity to discuss the principles that lie behind the designation. The adoption of the affirmative procedure for the first list gives the Chamber an opportunity to discuss these matters. It also gives Her Majesty's Government an opportunity to explain to noble Lords the logic and reasoning behind the placing of countries on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para8"></a>When it comes to changing the list, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has said, quick action is very often required. There may be a coup d'etat or a change of circumstances in a country which could endanger the life of an individual or a group of individuals. Quick action would certainly be needed, but I suggest to the noble Lord that this would be a very significant matter for the country concerned and Parliament should have the opportunity, if it so chose, to discuss the matter. Of course, the negative resolution procedure would give this House that opportunity.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It is my intention to speak to Amendments Nos. 24A, 25A and 26, mainly on the understanding that that is what I believe we have been discussing for 50 of the last 54 minutes, and in the hope that when we come to Amendments Nos. 24A, 25A and 26, we will not have this debate all over again.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para9"></a>As has already been said, we have accepted the reasoning put forward by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee for the initial order under Clause 1 to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, with subsequent orders by the negative resolution procedure. The new version of Clause 1 implements that recommendation in full. I am grateful to my noble friends for what they have said about that. I can assure the House that the first designation order will be comprehensive and will contain all the countries considered suitable for designation at that time. To remind the House, the countries we are currently considering as being suitable for designation are Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ghana, India, Pakistan, Poland and Romania.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 24A and 25A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and Amendment No. 26, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, go much further. Amendments Nos. 24A and 25A propose that the affirmative procedure is adopted for all changes to the designation order; namely, whether countries should be added to the list or removed from it. Amendment No. 26 is similar. That amendment would prescribe the affirmative procedure for the first and all subsequent designation orders which add countries to the designated list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para11"></a>The designation procedure must be sufficiently flexible for us to be able to make amendments quickly. If I may be forgiven, I should like to employ an <P>


<a name="column_1043"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1043</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>argument which I believe was used by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and with which I wholeheartedly agree. There may well be occasions when we want to remove a country from the list very quickly indeed. There is a slight difference between us, because I am tempted to accept that there should be no procedure at all; but I believe that Parliament would still like to know whether a country was to be removed from the list. However, it can be done quickly, particularly if the case for removing the country from the list is uncontentious. But to subject this procedure to the affirmative procedure would--or could potentially--cause very real problems in the future. I believe that this argument was an argument accepted by the scrutiny committee, and I am grateful for what the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, said about that. As I have said, there may be sound reasons for needing to add a country to the list quickly--for example, as a result of a sudden influx of unfounded applications. That is another reason we put to the scrutiny committee, which agreed that flexibility was important.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para12"></a>The negative procedure is already used for extending visa requirements to additional countries and for making other changes to the Immigration Rules. As the debates in both Houses on the benefit changes earlier this year demonstrated, the negative procedure is capable of providing effective parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para13"></a>Designation will not of course result in automatic refusal of asylum claims, and it will not result in the denial of an appeal right. That is a very important point to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para14"></a>As I have said, I would have no objection to the proposal in Amendment No. 26 that the Secretary of State should be able to remove a country from the designation list without any parliamentary approval, but I simply cannot accept the amendment as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para15"></a>As I have said, the Government have implemented in full the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. However, Amendments Nos. 24A, 25A and 26 depart from the committee's report and are, for the reasons I have given, undesirable and unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para16"></a>On some of the points that have been made during the course of debate, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, referred to procedures for considering claims from designated countries. I hope that we shall actually resort to accuracy in the course of our debates. I said it at Second Reading, but I shall say it again now: we envisage that applications from nationals of designated countries will be considered under the short procedure, and in relation to those who apply on arrival, they will be interviewed on the day of arrival if the applicant is fit and well enough to be interviewed. The applicants then have a month--not a matter of days, but a month--in which to submit additional information before the case is considered. It is not the case that the case will be completed from the start to the end of appeal within 10 days. Cases are unlikely to take anything less than two months, even under this new procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-09_para17"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, has played with figures--and I suppose that one can make almost anything of the figures--but it is irrefutable that, in <P>


<a name="column_1044"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1044</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1988, there were 3,998 applications for asylum in this country. In 1995, there were 43,965. We can talk as much as we like about how many leave the country, how many are dealt with in this way, that way or the other way; the truth is that when 43,965 applications are made, they have to be dealt with; they have to be processed; and they go into the appeal system. Noble Lords will remember that I said there was a backlog of 84,000 cases. That is the arithmetic. That is the time-consuming part, and that is why we have increased by eight times the number of people dealing with applications. That is why we have made available a great deal more money to speed up the process. However, it is not just to be tackled from one angle; it actually needs to be tackled by the system for dealing with the asylum applications as well.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am very sorry that the noble Baroness thinks that I have played with figures, since the figure on which I relied most heavily was supplied by herself.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   What I was saying was that the noble Lord used figures in a context which I believe was quite different from the context in which my noble friend Lord Renton used them. My noble friend Lord Renton said that we have a problem. My noble friend Lord Renton, in the way in which he used the figures, said that the numbers were escalating and that it was causing a problem. That is why we have a Bill before the House. If the noble Lord is taking issue with the fact that the asylum applications are running at around about 43,000, 44,000 or 45,000 applications a year at this moment, then I would be pleased to hear his evidence for that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness for a little illumination. My understanding is that a case has to be prepared and dealt with within 17 days of receiving the Home Office notice of refusal of an application. If that is incorrect, would the noble Baroness tell me on exactly what grounds it is incorrect? That is the information I have received from a number of quarters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am saying that the Home Office, in that sense, will be dealing with them. Under the new system, the first substantive appeal will be heard, and people, on arrival, as I have said, will have their cases heard and they will be given a month to provide the information before their cases are properly, fully considered. Then the timetable starts, and if they go into the accelerated procedure, then the time table starts to count; and if they go into the other part of the procedure then of course the accelerated time table will not apply.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   For the clarification of the Committee, perhaps I may say that the understanding is that the 30 days to which the noble Baroness was referring apply from the moment when somebody first attempts to get asylum. The 17 days that I was referring to are when the procedure for appeal starts. I just want to make it clear that I believe there was a misunderstanding between us. I was not deliberately using an inaccuracy; I would not wish to do <P>


<a name="column_1045"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1045</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, and it would be inaccurate and impolite to the noble Baroness to do that. I hope that I have not done that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Baroness is talking about the appeal stage, and I am talking about the fact that there will be a substantive consideration of the case following arrival and, in preparation of that case, they will be given a month in which to provide information in relation to that case. Then of course it goes, if it is appropriate, into the accelerated appeal procedure. In speaking to the amendment, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said that the designated list would be a matter for the opinion of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. It will not be a matter for his opinion. He may well have a view that a country should be added to the list but whether or not it is added will be a matter for Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para0"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, and his committee took into consideration the fact that we intend to put together all those countries which we consider to be potential candidates at the first stage under the affirmative resolution procedure. Therefore, it is highly probable that following that, single countries will come forward for consideration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. Perhaps I may ask her for some clarification. She said that the decision about countries will be a matter for Parliament and I am very grateful to her for that. She then went on to say that all the countries will be dealt with together in one order. How then could Parliament exclude one country but not another?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I have given the names of the countries which we are considering at the moment as candidates for the affirmative resolution procedures following Royal Assent of the Bill. The order will then come before this Chamber and another place. If either House then has very serious reservations about the case being made for any one of those countries, so serious that there is grave concern about the whole package being allowed to go through, although it is not normal and usual I suggest that the House should think seriously about its power to reject the list until it comes forward in a form which is acceptable to Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para1"></a>It is open to Parliament to do that. The noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, is right to say that it will not be possible to cherry-pick off the list and say, "We do not like this", or, "We do not like that", but it will be possible to say that the list is not acceptable to Parliament until something is done in relation to the country which Parliament finds is an unacceptable entry on the list.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-10_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, I thank her very warmly indeed for those remarks.

<FONT SIZE=3>Office is not liaising effectively with the Foreign Office. That liaison goes on all the time. Certainly in the course of drawing up the list, we have liaised with the Foreign Office. I have named the current candidates for the list. Earlier candidates which were also considered for the list were Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, all of which have been dropped from it. I should put on the record that Nigeria, Algeria, Sri Lanka and Turkey have never been considered for that list. Using the expertise, information and intelligence of the Foreign Office, we shall update continually our views on those countries. Therefore, if it is proposed to add a country on to the list following the initial group of countries that Parliament will be invited to agree, it will be important that the Home Secretary puts to Parliament written assessments of those countries which in his opinion are suitable candidates for addition to the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para3"></a>I advise the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that we are liaising very closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the very complex situation in Turkey.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para4"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may read from the report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. I was privileged in that a Bill which I took through Parliament was the first candidate for the services of that committee. I have always found it hugely helpful, as I am sure does the House, to have the benefit of its work. Page five of its report states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe that in order to ensure the maximum flexibility, only the first exercise of such powers should be subject to affirmative resolution. Subsequent uses of the powers should be subject to negative procedure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para5"></a>The next part is very important and I am extremely happy to respond to it. The noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, has made the point that it is the House which is being informed about these matters. The report continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The House may wish to seek an assurance from the Minister that the first list of countries under each power (which alone will, if our recommendation is adopted, be subject to affirmative resolution) will be as comprehensive as possible, so as to facilitate debate on the principles governing the compilation of the list. Subsequent negative procedure would allow the House to debate the issues again when necessary".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is a very important point which I take extremely seriously. When the first list is brought before Parliament, we shall debate all the issues and present information to Parliament to try to persuade it that countries should be added to the list. The criteria and principles which underlie our reasons for compiling the list in the first place will be an important pointer in relation to any subsequent additions to the list. I hope that the Committee will not accept Amendments Nos. 24A, 25A and 26.

<A NAME = "60423-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I preface my remarks on this amendment by saying how grateful I am to the Minister for the way in which she wound up the debate on the original amendment, in particular, for her comments on <P>


<a name="column_1047"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the possibility of finding an accelerated procedure for removing countries from the list and, indeed, if I heard her correctly, for her suggestions about the way in which this Chamber may wish to consider individual countries within the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para7"></a>Amendment No. 2 returns to the substantive clause as now redrafted and refers to a particular point which is not covered elsewhere. I am not sure that it was dealt with during consideration of the Bill in the Commons. In my later amendment, Amendment No. 4, which refers to the possibilities of persecution in one part of a country, we criticise the use of the words "in general" as a criterion for inclusion in the designated list. Of course, other considerations are included in the Immigration Rules which we must make sure are included in the consideration of each individual case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para8"></a>I remind the Committee that the Immigration Rules, which have been published and debated in this Chamber, are, according to the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, required to be in conformity with the 1951 convention. Therefore, any question of changes to the Immigration Rules must be taken very seriously. They are not statutory, but they have an independent authority which makes it impossible for the Government to change them if there is any conflict with the 1951 convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para9"></a>In addition to referring to the possibility of persecution in one part of a country, the Immigration Rules refer also to the need for consideration of age, beliefs, way of life and/or medical condition. The important point is that the Immigration Rules require that the particular facts of the individual case should be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para10"></a>Our concern throughout the whole of the consideration of Clause 1, with its fast-track procedures, designated list of countries and the vast extension of what used to be the definition of applications which are without foundation, is that it is not possible for there to be individual consideration of particular cases or the particular facts of the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-10_para11"></a>The Immigration Rules provide that the consideration of an application should take into account the practicalities of an individual case. Account should be taken of the fact that persecution may not simply be carried out by the government in the originating country but could be carried out by forces which that government cannot control. That could happen, for example, in Kashmir; it is certainly happening in Liberia at the moment, and probably in a large number of other countries. Therefore it is essential that we should not have the criterion, which is implied in the whole concept of the designated list, of general political stability, but that there should be the option of consideration of the particular facts of the case. Amendment No. 2 states that we have to be sure that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"individual consideration has been given by the Secretary of State to the merits of the person's claim for asylum". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope that I can help the noble Lord as I believe that his anxiety is unfounded. In support of Amendment No. 2, it has been suggested that an explicit provision is required to make clear that a certificate cannot be issued under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the 1993 Act unless an asylum claim has been individually considered. The amendment is superfluous. It is already the case, in the 1993 Act and in the Bill as drafted, that an asylum seeker can only have his application refused if he does not meet the criteria set out in the 1951 convention. Those criteria have been incorporated into immigration law under Sections 1 and 2 of the 1993 Act. Nothing in the 1993 Act, or in this Bill, detracts from that principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para0"></a>It follows, therefore, that the application has to be considered against the convention criteria before a decision can be taken on whether the applicant is or is not a refugee. The certification procedure, which is the subject of Clause 1, comes into play only after the Secretary of State has concluded in the light of such an assessment--that is, against the convention criteria--that the applicant is not a refugee. It is at that point that the 1993 Act provides a mechanism for assigning manifestly unfounded applications into an accelerated appeal procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para1"></a>Therefore, the Secretary of State first examines the application against the convention criteria. Only if it fails those criteria does he go on to consider whether it falls under any of the criteria for certification set out in the expanded version of paragraph 5 which Clause 1 of the Bill will insert into the 1993 Act. Given that the amendment seeks to correct a non-existent problem, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not think it is a non-existent problem; indeed, later amendments refer to the necessity for us to have regard to international obligations other than the 1951 convention. We shall debate those in due course. I do not wish to trespass on that. However, in so far as we have so far only been considering our obligations under the 1951 convention, I am prepared to say that I shall read carefully what the Minister has said and consider what action to take at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para3"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: Amendment No. 3 asks that nothing in the relevant paragraph should apply to those who have been tortured, or might reasonably expect to be subjected to torture. At the Report stage in another place an all-party amendment was moved to take torture victims out of the scope of the proposed legislation. The amendment was narrowly lost. Following that debate, an all-party group met Home Office Ministers. Subsequently Home Office officials met the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. I know that nothing was said at those meetings to offer reassurance that torture victims would not be disadvantaged by Clauses 1 and 2. I very much hope that the Minister will accept this amendment, or perhaps find more effective words to meet its intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para4"></a>The continued practice of torture is one of the most shocking examples of the fact that evil and barbarity continue to flourish in the world. The comfortable world owes those who have suffered torture the chance to rebuild confidence and health and to find fresh opportunity to live in a peaceful and just surrounding. We are part of that comfortable world and we should take our proper share of the neediest who seek asylum. I regretted that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, used the emotive word "flood". To refer back to a famous remark of Mr. Reginald Maudling, the numbers that we have heard about today hardly constitute the difference between a flood and standing on dry land.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para5"></a>The Committee should take seriously the consistent evidence of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is impossible to help rehabilitate survivors of torture if they are frightened and uncertain whether or not they are to be returned to face further persecution". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I have led five ecumenical delegations to the Home Office on these subjects. Last autumn we met Mr. Howard. He told us that he believed that asylum seekers saw Britain as a soft touch. It became clear to me that a major motive in introducing this Bill was to run up a signal that Britain has a harsh regime which will make it difficult for asylum seekers to find refuge here; in other words, to stop them applying here at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para6"></a>The argument that Britain is a soft touch would persuade us that the number of applications for asylum in the United Kingdom has risen because other western European countries have strengthened their asylum procedures. I believe it is more likely to be true that the increase in applications here is due mainly to the close historical or cultural ties that the applicants' countries had through the years of the British Empire. Six countries accounted for almost half the asylum applications in Britain in 1995: Nigeria, Somalia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Ghana. Those are countries where serious questions about human rights have grown in the past few years. Canada takes asylum seekers from mostly those same countries. In Canada 70 per cent. of such applications are recognised but in Canada the first decisions are taken by an independent body. Those historical ties may result in some substantial costs to this country in receiving asylum seekers. However, it is worth remembering that the same historical ties played a large part in making this country rich.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para7"></a>I asked Mr. Howard how an asylum seeker could pursue an appeal if benefit were withdrawn. He replied that an asylum seeker could pursue an appeal from outside the country. For asylum seekers an appeal right from abroad is useless. It is useless to those in most need of it; those who have already been returned to a country in which they fear persecution. We are talking about many of the most vulnerable people in the world. If one had suffered torture, one would use whatever means one could to escape, including obtaining false documents, and one would have a natural fear of officialdom. That would inhibit one, on the day of arriving in a strange country, where people spoke a language one might not understand, from telling one's whole story truthfully. In other legal fields such trauma is allowed for. I think of rape cases where it is quite properly understood that trauma will prevent someone from telling the truth, perhaps for a long time, until the victim feels much more secure with the people to whom she is speaking.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para8"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will take seriously the report of the Glidewell Panel. The panel has received evidence from a wide range of those individuals who have close experience of immigration and asylum matters. Here are two of its comments:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are not convinced that the clauses, when implemented, will guarantee protection for those asylum seekers with a well-founded fear of persecution. We urge the Home Office to take account of other human rights criteria when determining claims for exceptional leave to remain, particularly the 1984 UN Convention against Torture". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para9"></a>One of the points the Glidewell Panel makes deserves close attention. It states that the 1993 Act had effectively created a "culture of disbelief" in the whole Home Office machinery--a culture of disbelief about the legitimacy of claims to asylum. It states that that is the reason for the rapid and dramatic decline in the proportion of asylum seekers granted refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. Those figures are then used to justify the belief that most asylum seekers are "bogus".
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para10"></a>I take exception to the word "bogus" whenever it is used in this context. I feel very angry when I read that word in a newspaper like the Daily Mail. I feel even more deeply disturbed when I read in Hansard of another place the Secretary of State for Social Security using the word "bogus" repeatedly, unsupported by any evidence. I have been glad to note that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has avoided using that word in your Lordships' House. The word is finding its way into a wider and more damaging situation. One of the submissions made to the Glidewell Panel was from Newham, a borough that I used to know well. Sajida Malik of the Newham monitoring project told the panel of her own experience of that climate of fear while working with children in schools in the borough of Newham. She says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I was horrified by the things I heard young children talking about. For example, when we raised the issue of asylum seekers and refugees they talked about them in the context of being bogus--welfare scroungers, beggars, dirty and disgusting". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Home Office figures for 1990-95 show the total number refused both refugee status and exceptional leave to remain. In 1990 the figure was 17.5 per cent. of the <P>


<a name="column_1051"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1051</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applicants. In 1995 it was 78.9 per cent. Those figures do not prove that there have been more bogus applicants. Rather they prove that the gateway to entry has been drastically narrowed by deliberate policy and by encouraging the culture of disbelief.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para11"></a>One further comment seems to me to be relevant to the amendment. I believe that the use of the categories contained in Clause 1 is likely to be self-defeating. Rather than speeding up the process it is highly likely to increase the time spent on cases which require substantive consideration. I hope that noble Lords will read the evidence presented to the Glidewell Panel by the chief adjudicator on page 13 of the report. If most of the initial listings on the fast track have to be adjourned, it will take longer overall. The Bill obliges the adjudicator to take fast track cases first. If a large number is adjourned, other asylum cases will be put back. So will standard immigration cases. The adjudicator is obliged to set a date for hearing within five days, but a log-jam could easily mean that the date he has to set will be 12 months or more away.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para12"></a>This debate should not be about numbers but about justice. The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture insists that individual cases must be dealt with on an individual basis with thorough examination of statements and claims. The fast track approach is inappropriate for those who claim to have been victims of torture or in danger of torture. Such cases should explicitly be taken out of the scope of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I support the amendment. It seems to me that torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, or the threat of it, are the ultimate and appalling acts that people do to their fellow human beings. I should declare an interest. Until a year ago I was director of the Refugee Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para13"></a>Anyone who has met persons seeking safety in this country who may have suffered from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment will know that the normal human reaction is not to be able to talk about it--certainly not immediately, and possibly not for quite a long period of time. I remember meeting some of the Bosnians who had been held in Serb detention camps. They came to Britain under a Home Office scheme. One or two felt able to talk about the most terrible things that had happened to them. Many others were not able to speak; and sometimes weeks later they felt more confident and could talk about their appalling experiences. Some of the victims of such treatment may feel that they can never talk about it because it is too awful; they may have difficulty in coming to terms with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para14"></a>One has to envisage that background against the intentions of the Bill. My fear is that anyone who finds it hard to describe his experiences will have difficulty in obtaining justice under the Government's procedures. For the reasons I have given, if an individual cannot say, "This is what happened to me. This is the threat. This is the reality of what I suffered", it will be difficult for him to persuade officials of his circumstances in such a way that the decision is made for him to stay in this country.
<P>


<a name="column_1052"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1052</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para15"></a>There is a dilemma there. I appreciate that in the fullness of time those individuals may suffer simply because of their inability to describe and express their experiences. However, in a number of instances, given time and less pressure to state their situation quickly, they may find it possible, perhaps through a professional adviser, a lawyer or another adviser, to begin to explain what has happened to them so that their case may be put for them to the Home Office by their lawyers or advisers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para16"></a>I am anxious that anyone who has been subjected to torture, or the threat of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, be given enough time to have his case put for him and properly considered. If we are to subject to further problems people who have already suffered in this way, I fear that a fast track process will deny justice to those victims of torture, or those who fear torture, even more than that process will deny justice to other people. It is for that reason that we must be enormously concerned about the Bill's implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para17"></a>The amendment may apply quite properly to persons fearing torture or inhuman or degrading treatment who may not otherwise qualify under the 1951 Geneva Convention. Nevertheless, this country has properly signed other international instruments concerned with torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. An individual may fear torture or inhuman or degrading punishment, even if he is outside the convention. In such instances it is surely proper that other international conventions that we have signed should be brought to bear. That is one of the aims of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-11_para18"></a>I trust that as a country we would not willingly send anyone to another land where there is a high risk that he may suffer in some of the ways suggested in the amendment. My fear is that the procedures which the Home Office adopts and which are in the clause may well have that outcome, even if it is not intended. That is why I see the amendment as at least one safeguard to prevent that happening.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Norfolk: </B>   I put my name to this amendment because more and more torture is experienced and takes place in the world. The provision should be spelt out in the body of the Bill. The right reverend Prelate moved the amendment extremely well and I have nothing to add.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   This is an important short debate and I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for the way in which he moved the amendment. I wish to add two thoughts to what he and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said. First, victims of torture are often those most likely to fall victim to two of the subsections of Clause 1; that is, they are likely to travel with fraudulent or false documents. If they come from countries so savage that they are willing to use torture for judicial reasons, it is unlikely that they would be able to leave with their documents in proper order. Almost by definition, they are likely to be the most genuine of refugees when they fall short of the provisions of the subsections of Clause 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para0"></a>Secondly, I urge the amendment on the Committee because, as the noble Duke said, it is crucial that the provisions in the amendment be spelt out on the face of <P>


<a name="column_1053"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1053</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Bill. We may receive well intentioned assurances, but the Bill will go forward into legislation and be with us for all time, as governments, administrations and Home Secretaries change. Therefore, it is crucial that we single out victims of torture as a special category, if only to give a lead to other countries to treat them as special cases. I add that many of those who suffer torture do so for upholding the very ideals in which we most believe.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   I rise to underline the point that behind the amendment is the contrast with the shortness of time allowed under the fast procedure. The noble Baroness gave us an indication of that: a month to first determination and a possible 17 days afterwards. There is a contrast between that shortness of time and the difficulty that people who have been tortured have in expressing experiences that they have been through. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has already made the point, but it came home to me particularly as I was recently reading an account written by one of the hostages in Lebanon. In the preface to his book he mentions the intense difficulty he had in articulating his experiences. If that is true for someone who is well educated and articulate, it is likely to be just as true for someone who is less well educated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para1"></a>In looking through the briefings, I was struck by an account of a young Tamil who had been tortured. I was struck not least because I know Colombo and Sri Lanka well and was in Colombo last November when Tamils were being rounded up and taken to local police stations. The account describes how a young Tamil was rounded up by the local police in an earlier event. He was detained, kicked, punched; his hands stamped on; his body repeatedly burned with cigarettes; his head frequently smashed against a wall; he was hit with rifle butts and with a PVC pipe filled with something weighty; he was stabbed with bayonets and on some occasions tied to a door and beaten. That is what one means by "torture". That victim's brother bribed the police to free him and he eventually escaped to the UK. His first claim for asylum was refused and it was only after that refusal that medical reports were received. The medical and psychiatric reports brought out the torture to which he had been subjected. Had he been put through the fast-track procedure, time would not have allowed all that to emerge.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para2"></a>Behind the amendment lies the fact that people who are the most likely of all to be returned to situations of immense distress are those who may find it most difficult to articulate their case in the short term and with the fast-track procedure. That is why we press the amendment. I support the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool.

<A NAME="60423-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   I wish to add my personal experience to the debate. Sometimes when one sees first-hand accounts of such experiences, they strike a deep chord. This is a crucial amendment. I can think of three people whom I know to be particularly articulate; one is a practising physician and scientist; one a pure scientist <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>working in my field and one a university teacher. All are highly intelligent. Of the two women, one was subjected to rape and one to sexual abuse. The third was simply tortured. What struck me about all three individuals is that it took them many months before they were able to come to terms with any of the aspects of their treatment and before they could talk about it. It is interesting that one of the people who went on to do a PhD with me ended up publishing over 70 internationally recognised papers. She has proved to be an extraordinarily useful member of society and I wonder what would have happened had she not had the opportunity of asylum. Had she been "fast-tracked", I am sure that it would have been impossible for her to seek refuge as she did.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   Members on all sides of the Committee are, I am sure, keen to have a system that welcomes asylum seekers to this country in a sensitive way, particularly those who have suffered or fear torture. It must be a terrible experience. I am sure that that is constantly in the Minister's mind as we go through the Bill. So it was with great sadness that I listened to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool because I feel that the Government's motives are truly honourable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, is right that it is important to have these provisions on the face of the Bill. One reason I believe he is right is that drawing attention to the subject may do something to improve the standard of burden of proof that is at present required by the Home Office. The proper standard of burden of proof is, I understand, that set out in the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Keith, in Siva Kumaran: that the applicant's fear of persecution should be well founded means that there has to be demonstrated a reasonable degree of likelihood that he will be persecuted for a convention reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para3"></a>At present, the adjudications that we are getting on the subject of torture require a good deal more than that. Take, for example, this refusal letter:

It is the word "conclusive" that clearly indicates a mistaken requirement of the standards of burden of proof. Again, let us take this letter of refusal:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The scarring on your back shows evidence of injury, but the Secretary of State is of the opinion that this does not show the cause or reason". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I am afraid that it is literally as well as proverbially true that scars do not speak. Scars cannot by themselves show the reason for which they were inflicted. The normal formulation of expert witnesses is that the scars are entirely compatible with the applicant's story. That satisfies the standard of proof set out in Siva Kumaran. That seems to me to be the appropriate standard for which adjudicators should look. I hope that the passing of the amendment will make that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para4"></a>It is well known to the Committee that I do not believe that the Department of Social Security is a soft touch. I believe exactly the opposite. But its requirements on believing an applicant on burden of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>proof are a great deal more appropriate than those we find in the refusal letters. The following is a commissioner's ruling of 1985:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The tribunal may reach this conclusion even though the only evidence is that of the claimant himself. There is no rule of English law that corroboration of the claimant's own evidence is necessary. In some cases a tribunal may rightly think that they cannot act on the claimant's uncorroborated evidence, either because it is self-contradictory or inherently improbable, or because the claimant's demeanour does not inspire confidence in his truthfulness. It is seldom safe to reject evidence solely for this last reason". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
One reason for passing this amendment is to tell that to the Home Office.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I hope that the amendment will be given careful consideration. I am not sure whether its drafting is perfect--indeed, I have some doubts as to that. But the important point, as was stated by the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, is that if we accept this amendment or something like it, we insert the word "torture" into the Bill, and thereby draw the attention of those who will have to administer the legislation over the years to the significance of cases of torture. Therefore I hope that, whether or not the Committee decides to accept the amendment as it stands--on which I am more than prepared to listen to the argument of my noble friend the Minister--I hope that she will look very sympathetically indeed upon an amendment that includes the word "torture".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-12_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   Several noble Lords have cited tragic situations involving the torture of asylum seekers. We are debating Amendment No. 3, which has two parts. If I understand it correctly, sub-paragraph (b) would allow claims not from those asylum seekers who have suffered torture but from those from countries with a "recently documented record of torture". I wonder why those people are included in Amendment No. 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-12_para5"></a>On another point, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool inferred that Canada took many more asylum seekers than we do in this country. I suggest that that country is somewhat larger than ours, and that the population is considerably smaller. I wonder whether we should be comparing this country with Canada.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, asked a question about the second part of the amendment; namely, where these people would be if the amendment were passed. The answer is that there would still be very good protection to make sure that only genuine applicants for asylum are accepted into this country. All the amendment states is that the procedures in Schedule 2 to the 1993 Act, which extend the range of fast track procedures, would no longer apply to such people. Therefore I do not think that the noble Baroness's intervention in any way diminishes the case that has been made for this amendment.  
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-13_spnew1"></A><B> The Duke of Norfolk: </B>   There is no need to go into matters such as scars and the medical evidence of torture. When I served with a group of Soviet forces in East Germany a well-known torture was to stand the <P>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1056</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prisoner outside, pour a bucket of water over him and let him freeze for a bit. That is torture, just as much as whipping and bashing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Torture is a difficult and emotive subject on which to exercise judgment dispassionately. It is an abhorrent practice and one which we all condemn.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para0"></a>There is nothing between ourselves and the supporters of these amendments on what the object of our policy should be. The Government attach very great importance to ensuring that victims of torture who come here for refuge should receive protection. Moreover, such people engage our international obligations. That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. Torture is almost by definition a form of persecution and a person who has a well-founded fear of torture is very likely to qualify for asylum under the terms of the 1951 convention. If, exceptionally, he does not meet those criteria, he may well engage our obligations under other instruments, such as the European Convention on Human Rights. In short, a person who has a well-founded fear of torture is granted either asylum or exceptional leave.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para1"></a>Amendment No. 3 relates to Clause 1. We do not believe that it will help to identify and deal speedily with genuine victims of torture. But we do believe that it could be widely exploited by people seeking to evade the accelerated appeal procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para2"></a>Amendment No. 3 would prevent a certificate from being issued if the country of origin has a recently documented record of torture. But what does a "recently documented record of torture" actually mean? There are, for example, very few countries indeed where there are not from time to time allegations of brutality by members of law enforcement agencies. But that is very different from saying that torture is systematic and widespread, or that a particular asylum seeker would be at any risk of torture if removed. On the face of it, that part of the amendment alone would suffice to prevent the issue of a Clause 1 certificate in a high proportion of cases and without any real basis in a substantial risk to the applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para3"></a>The amendment would also prevent a certificate being issued if the applicant "shows a reasonable claim" that he has been tortured. The meaning of these words is very unclear. We believe that that formula would open up a claim of torture to exploitation by the unscrupulous, in the same way as our asylum procedures in general are at present exploited by those whose claims are not genuine. For example, asylum seekers from designated countries would have an incentive to include a claim of torture in their application as a mechanism for circumventing Clause 1, and that would considerably reduce its effectiveness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para4"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 16. Sub-paragraph 4(a) allows a certificate to be issued under Clause 1 if a claim does not show a fear of persecution on one of the grounds specified in the 1951 convention. The amendment would prevent a certificate under sub-paragraph 4(a) if the claim showed a fear of torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. We agree that a person who claims a fear of torture will normally have <P>


<a name="column_1057"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1057</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done enough to avoid a certificate under sub-paragraph 4(a). However, we oppose the amendment because it departs from the precise wording of the 1951 convention. It is that convention which has been incorporated into United Kingdom immigration law and which should be reflected in the drafting of this Bill. We do not consider it would be appropriate to import terminology not contained in the 1951 convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para5"></a>It is important to remind the Committee that the Bill deals with asylum procedures. It is quite true that if people do not qualify under the asylum procedures, we still have an obligation to conform under other international obligations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   Is the noble Baroness saying that under other rules in the proposed legislation tortured people will be adequately covered? Have we not received abundant evidence of people who have quite clearly been tortured but who have been sent back to their own countries? In the light of all that evidence, it is surely not sufficient to say that the provisions here will be adequate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   We want to do everything possible to make sure that genuine applications are properly considered. Indeed, one of the problems that we have at the moment is that many applications are not genuine from the very beginning. Such applications make it difficult to give time to genuine victims of torture.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para6"></a>Much has been said during the course of this debate about people who simply cannot express their claim of torture. If they do not, or will not, express it, it is impossible to consider it. Unless a claim of torture is made, it cannot be properly considered. We are trying to arrive at a situation whereby a genuine claim of torture is properly considered and, if genuine, is well-founded at the first stage of consideration. A substantive claim will then go on either to receive asylum or to be considered if it does not conform precisely to the 1951 convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para7"></a>That was the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, who is attempting to transport other international obligations into the Bill to widen the criteria of the Bill itself. We want to keep the criteria of the Bill totally and absolutely consistent with the 1951 United Nations Convention, so that exceptional leave to remain or other international obligations are invoked if the case does not fit entirely within the asylum procedures. The intention is that genuine victims of torture should be picked up by the system. I hope that nothing I have said detracts from our genuine desire to see that such cases are properly considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para8"></a>
One has to say that mistakes have been made in the past, and no doubt will be made in future; but we want to minimise the possibility of mistakes being made. The term,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which the amendment would insert into sub-paragraph 4(a), is taken from the European Convention on Human Rights. We are of course bound by our obligation under the European Convention in the asylum field, as in other areas. If an applicant's case engages our obligations <P>


<a name="column_1058"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1058</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under the European Convention but not the 1951 Convention, then it is our policy to grant exceptional leave. The European Convention already provides an avenue of redress for the individual through the European Commission and Court of Human Rights. For those reasons we believe the amendment to sub-paragraph 4(a) to be both unnecessary and inappropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para9"></a>All sides are agreed about the aims of the policy. We all agree that the objective must be to identify genuine victims of torture. Achieving that objective depends on having in place proper practices and effective training for our caseworkers and our interviewers. We need to concentrate on these practical issues rather than on legislative measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para10"></a>In my written response to the Second Reading debate I referred to the very great importance and weight which is attached to any evidence of torture, especially when supported by a medical certificate. Caseworkers already have access to the guidelines for the examination of survivors of torture which have been prepared by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. But we want to be absolutely sure that our arrangements are as effective as we can make them and that they attract confidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para11"></a>That is why, following a meeting between my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Home Office and a cross-party group of parliamentarians, we asked officials to meet the Medical Foundation to discuss ways in which our procedures may be further improved. The meeting which took place recently was constructive. We are following up a number of suggestions made by the foundation, and I hope that we shall be able to report more fruitfully at a later date. The Government believe this to be the right response to concerns of this nature, and one which will achieve the results we all desire.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para12"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool talked about the Glidewell Report and referred to a lack of belief. First of all, I do not accept what the right reverend Prelate says. The fall in the recognition rate in the late 1980s, which was referred to, and in the early 1990s, coincided with a massive rise in the level of exploitation of the asylum system by people who were not refugees. The level of claims rose from 4,000 in 1988 to 45,000 in 1991. Since 1992, the recognition rate has remained reasonably stable at between 3 per cent. and 7 per cent. But the number of cases granted asylum in 1995 was more than double the number granted in 1979--1,295 compared with 525. And the number of cases granted asylum or exceptional leave in 1995 was 5,705--the fourth highest annual figure ever recorded.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para13"></a>It would be equally wrong to suggest that we have tightened up our interpretation of the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees which, in any event, is determined ultimately by the courts, not by the Home Office. We also use a discretionary grant of exceptional leave where the convention criteria is not met in individual cases but where there are compelling compassionate circumstances to justify leave to remain outside of the normal immigration rules. In 1995 16 per cent. of all decisions were grants of exceptional leave to remain.
<P>


<a name="column_1059"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1059</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para14"></a>Other reference was made to time constraints. The time constraints only come into play after there has been substantive consideration of the claim when time is given to gather evidence and to collect evidence such as medical certificates. The concerns expressed could be an argument: what does one do if somebody does not talk, does not make the claim for torture or does not explain why they believe they have been tortured? If they do not do it, the concerns expressed could be an argument for never reaching a final decision, never actually coming to a decision in a case for a refused asylum seeker, just in case, at some time in the future, when they do feel more at ease, they are able to reveal that they had been a victim of torture.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-13_para15"></a>I have to suggest that that particular suggestion and that particular system would be unworkable given the number of people who claim a fear of torture and a fear of persecution, and those who have a well-founded fear of it once the substantive case is heard and it is heard again at appeal.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60423-14_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Liverpool: </B>   I believe that on all sides of this Committee there is a wish that torture should be on the face of the Bill. That is an important issue and principle. I am certain that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has a genuine intention to protect. But I remind her that she said no doubt mistakes have been made. It is precisely our concern that the fast-track procedure makes it more likely that mistakes would be made in the future. If the Government are concerned at the drafting of sub-paragraph (b) of the amendment, it is open to them--if the Committee agrees to the amendment--to bring an amendment to that to find a more effective wording, but I believe it is right that we should seek the opinion of the Committee and I ask that the amendment be put.

<A NAME="60423-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 15, leave out ("in general").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 4 is the third of the amendments to the redrafted Clause 1. It is an attack on the wording which is central to this part of the Bill; namely, that in the judgment of the Secretary of State:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is in general no serious risk of persecution". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para4"></a>We debated this point on Second Reading. I am aware that the wording has not been invented by the Government but is part of an international agreement between officials in the European Union. However, that does not make it any less dangerous. It is extremely dangerous for us to accept that the judgment as to whether there should be a fast-track procedure for an asylum application is that there is "in general" in any particular country a risk of persecution.
<P>


<a name="column_1062"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1062</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para5"></a>Persecution does not happen in countries in general. It happens to people in particular. It happens particularly to minority groups in countries in which there is no risk of persecution in general to the majority but where there is a very serious risk to the minority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para6"></a>Before I start to give examples, let me ask the Minister these questions. What does "in general" mean? How would it be interpreted? Does "in general" mean that 75 per cent., 90 per cent. or 95 per cent. of the people in a particular country need fear no risk of persecution? Is it a matter of the severity of the persecution? Would it mean that the risk could involve detention but not torture? Is it a matter of whether there is persecution not of groups but of individuals? All those questions, to which there are and can be no adequate answers, reveal the inadequacy and danger of the phrase "in general".
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para7"></a>A number of noble Lords on earlier amendments--indeed in the debate on the clause itself--referred to particular countries in which there is severe persecution of minorities. Perhaps I may give just a few examples. I refer to Pakistan and to the persecution of the Ahmadi population, and, in parts of that country, of the Christian population. In India people in Kashmir and people of the Sikh nation risk persecution, detention and even torture. In Romania, Bulgaria and unfortunately several Eastern European countries, there is persecution of the Roma or gypsy people. All of those are examples of persecution of minorities in countries of which it is fair to say that there is in general no serious risk of persecution. Yet for those people who are in the minorities who are persecuted the issue is as severe as it could be.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para8"></a>I appreciate that the difference here is not between an application being rejected outright and being dealt with properly, but between the fast-track procedure and the more normal procedure. Of course, as soon as we have declared that there is in general no serious risk of prosecution in a particular country that starts to be believed by the immigration officers and it sets the state of mind with which they look at applications from that country. Inevitably, that means that people who are genuinely being persecuted in those countries will be less likely to gain asylum.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para9"></a>Look at the effect on appeals of the designation of such countries. It is still true of course--I acknowledge this, and thank the Government for it--that there must be individual consideration by the adjudicator on appeal, but if that is the case, surely there are going to be that many more appeals. Where then do all the arguments for the saving of time and staff, which lie behind the whole thrust of this Bill, find their justification?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para10"></a>Judge Pearl, the chief adjudicator, giving evidence to the Glidewell panel, pointed out the possibility of a perverse effect, and said that the provisions might actually make things worse. He described to the Glidewell inquiry the situation with regard to appeals--as I was there I heard him myself. There are 2,200 appeals into the system every month and they are settling no more than 700. In other words, there is a net addition of 1,500 appeals every month to the numbers under consideration. He said that if we are going to <P>


<a name="column_1063"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1063</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prioritise, as we are required to do, appeals by those who fall under the categories described in Clause 1 of this Bill--they are very wide categories, much wider than the phrase "without foundation" which was used in the 1993 Act--not only will there be a slow-down in the number of appeals; there will be a standstill. They cannot go backwards, but there could be a standstill in the consideration of appeals for those not subjected to the fast-track procedure. That cannot be a sensible way to deal with the undoubted problem of an increase in the number of applications and an increase in the number of appeals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-14_para11"></a>On Second Reading we had a very considerable debate on the issue of delays and who was responsible for them. I do not think it appropriate, although I have many answers to the Government's arguments, to embark on that debate again in Committee and on a specific amendment. For the practical reasons that it will not save time or money, or solve the delay problem that the Government have identified, and for reasons of principle in that there is a real distinction between actual persecution of individuals and a general risk of persecution in a country as a whole, I believe that the amendment deserves the favourable consideration of the Committee. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and to explore, if I may, the Government's intention with regard to the words "in general". The noble Lord referred in particular to India. Perhaps I may detain the House for a moment with one or two personal reflections about when I was in India at a conference conducted by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation with regard to the launching of the new Indian Commission on Human Rights. That is a very welcome development and many of us are pleased that there is such a commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para0"></a>One of the issues which has particularly concerned the Indian Commission on Human Rights is the number of people involved in peaceful and non-violent activities--there are also violent activities--with regard to the issue of the future status of Kashmir. In a public report the Indian Commission on Human Rights drew attention to its concerns about the way some people who supported the different constitutional settlement in Kashmir had been detained and in some cases very badly treated in police stations in that area. That is not a piece of evidence from somebody from outside that country, but from a concerned local citizen--someone, if I may say so, at a high level of standing in the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para1"></a>The other personal observation I want to make concerns a country also on the white list; namely, Romania. Perhaps the Minister will tell us a little more about the force of the words "in general" in that regard. In my capacity as a director of an organisation called Project Liberty, which is concerned with building democratic institutions in Eastern Europe, I have visited Romania on many occasions. Unquestionably, it is a country which is struggling its way towards democracy, and I would not want to suggest anything that would discourage that, but there is one substantial group of Romanian citizens which it is widely agreed has suffered serious disadvantages and in some cases <P>


<a name="column_1064"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1064</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely bad treatment at the hands of the Romanian police. That is the so-called Roma, the gypsy minority population in Romania.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para2"></a>Many organisations in this country, specifically Amnesty International, the Refugee Council, and others, have been concerned about the treatment of Roma people in Romania. This is a matter that has been raised also, as the noble Baroness will know, in the Council of Europe on more than one occasion with regard to the attempt to try to build up a new treaty on the treatment of minorities. I would therefore be extremely grateful if the noble Baroness could say something about countries which are "in general", I agree, countries which cannot be associated with systematic persecution, but where there may be a particular minority, religious or ethnic, which cannot be regarded as being treated in a way that we would regard as appropriate for full citizens. I would particularly like to draw her attention to the cases of the Kashmiri dissidents in India and the Roma people in Romania, without delaying the House by giving details of some extremely harrowing instances of treatment in both cases.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Perhaps it might save time if I spoke on this amendment to the question of Bulgaria on which I have a separate amendment later. It relates to the problems of minorities, which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has raised and upon which my noble friend Lady Williams has now expanded in referring to the particular case of the Roma, which is not unique to Romania but also extends into Bulgaria.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para3"></a>I could not understand why Bulgaria should be put on the designation list when I thought about the human rights problems that exist there. They have been clearly identified by the US State Department and by Human Rights Watch and many others. I remind the Committee that Human Rights Watch said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ethically motivated violence and the failure of the authorities to provide redress for victims of such crimes continued to be a dominant human rights problem in 1995. The Roma minority continue to be the target of much police violence. Reports of xenophobic attacks and mob violence intensified during 1995, and the police and prosecutors failed to take forceful steps to bring the perpetrators to justice". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para4"></a>Human Rights Watch drew attention also to the restrictions on the free expression and association of people identified as ethnic Macedonians. The leaders of the United Macedonian Organisation, OMO Ilinden, were banned from meeting and that ban was upheld by the courts. It mentioned that 45 religious organisations have been refused registration since 1994 when a new law was passed forbidding non-profit-making organisations from operating without official permission. The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee says that there is a "religious witch-hunt" against certain minor sects. It cites cases of police searches for religious literature and even of individuals being dismissed from their posts because they belonged to the wrong faith.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para5"></a>Judge Alexey I Ivanof of the Regional Court of Sofia, testifying before a congressional committee on 27th November 1995, said that although Protestants had been part of Bulgaria for over 150 years, they often feel as though they are second-class citizens.
<P>


<a name="column_1065"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1065</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para6"></a>When I sent a copy of the annual report of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee to the Minister who deals with human rights, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, asking for his observations and drawing his specific attention to the closure of a Moslem group, the persecution of the Roma and the restrictions placed on religious groups, and suggesting that the OSCE's High Commissioner for National Minorities should take a look at the position, he made no comments about the substantive allegations that appeared in the report. He remarked that, since the HCNM's mandate was to give early warning of minority problems which may lead to conflict, his omission to visit Bulgaria made it appear that he did not consider that it was the case; that there was no likelihood of the persecution of minorities there escalating into an actual conflict.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para7"></a>I pointed out that the HCNM took a much broader view of his mandate; that he had visited 11 countries in the spring and summer of 1995 and that he went to Bulgaria in 1994. I emphasised too that the important question was whether or not the allegations made by the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee of discrimination against minorities such as the ethnic Turks and Roma were true and whether the perpetrators of racist violence were seldom, if ever, prosecuted, as alleged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para8"></a>The Minister replied that he did not wish to cast doubt on the committee's findings, nor to dismiss as insignificant the problems that minorities experienced in Bulgaria. He suggested that I pass the information on to the HCNM which would pursue it in confidence. In other words, he was saying that the case made out was not proven and needed to be examined. If that is the case, it is difficult to imagine why Bulgaria should be included on the list and whether or not the proposals should have been kept in abeyance until further and better particulars were obtained.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para9"></a>Some of the matters raised are susceptible to verification without a great deal of research. The facts in regard to the persecution of the original Moslem community under their chief mufti, Fikri Sali, are that he was unceremoniously dismissed by the government and replaced by a gentleman called Nedim Gendjev, who had been the leader of the Moslems during the communist regime and the faithful stooge of the dictator Tordor Zhivkov. He did not dare put his own name forward as the chief mufti, but was appointed as the President of the Supreme Religious Council by a national conference convened by irregular means on 3rd November 1994. A former sergeant major of the Labour Corps, Hadji Basri Hadjisherif, was appointed chief mufti. Those people had no religious training whatever and neither did the journalist named Dobroudjaliev who was appointed director of the Islamic Institute.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para10"></a>The government therefore swept away the hierarchy of the Moslem faith that existed after religious freedom had been restored in 1989, and replaced it with the people who had been the stooges of the old communist dictatorship. I should like to know whether the kind of situation that we face in Bulgaria, where there is no doubt at all that religious and ethnic minorities suffer serious persecution, means that there is no persecution <P>


<a name="column_1066"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1066</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"in general". Because the persecution applies only to the ethnic Turks, the Roma, the Sinti, to certain Moslem groups and Protestants, does that mean that the persecution that they suffer is specific and not general? Have the words "in general" led to the placing of Bulgaria on the list?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para11"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could deal with that point in her reply. It may save time later on if we know precisely what the connection is between the words "in general" which appear on the face of the clause, and the decision to place specific countries like Bulgaria on the designation list.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   One of the difficulties, I suspect, that we shall encounter as we go through the course of the day, is that there is a great deal of repetition in relation to some of the subjects. Specific amendments are tabled discussing specific countries, and I shall do what I can not to continue to go over that ground for the purposes of responding to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, with regard to the point made about oppressed minorities within a country. However, for the moment I shall address the argument in relation to the words "in general".
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para12"></a>Clause 1 provides for the designation of countries where it appears to the Secretary of State that there is in general no serious risk of persecution. That involves making a judgment as to whether the general risk of persecution in a particular country is sufficiently low to warrant designation. Amendment No. 4 would delete the words "in general". However, those words are necessary in order to make clear that the assessment being made is of the level of risk in a country rather than the risk to an individual. As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said, there may be individual cases in which a serious risk is established. Indeed, although there is currently a very high refusal rate for the countries we regard as candidates for designation, asylum or exceptional leave have been granted in a small number of cases. It does not follow from this that designation is inappropriate. The words "in general" are needed in order to make that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para13"></a>It is entirely right that applicants from countries where conditions are not in general unsafe and which produce large numbers of asylum seekers but very few genuine refugees should be asked to show that there are exceptional circumstances in their case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para14"></a>It has been suggested that the words "in general" would allow the Secretary or State to designate a country where a majority of the population was not at risk but which was seriously persecuting minority groups within it. That is patently not a tenable interpretation of the Bill. The wording clearly rules out designation of any country where there is a significant level of persecution, even if it is targeted at minorities. Our list of candidates for designation excludes a number of countries which generate large numbers of unfounded asylum claims, but in which there are nevertheless sufficient concerns about human rights that the requirement of the Bill is not met. Nigeria is an obvious example.
<P>


<a name="column_1067"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1067</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para15"></a>The criteria that we use are that the country generates a significant number of asylum applicants; that the applications from that country prove to be unfounded in a high proportion of cases, but that there is, in general, no persecution. We would use again as factors, stability of the country, the state's adherence to international human rights instruments, its democratic institutions, elections and political pluralism, freedom of expression by individuals and the media, and availability and effectiveness of legal avenues of protection and redress. It must be said that every individual case, irrespective of whether or not it is a designated country, is still considered on its merits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para16"></a>I turn to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. The situation in the countries we intend to designate is one of substantial safety and security. That does not mean that they are entirely without problems or that genuine cases of persecution will never arise. It would be unrealistic to insist on universal safety and, indeed, such a requirement is unnecessary given the safeguards which will continue to apply under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-15_para17"></a>Designation will allow us to deal more quickly and more effectively with the great majority of applicants who do not qualify for asylum. That must be in the interests of genuine asylum seekers. But the procedures used will allow exceptional cases, such as the small number from the seven countries who qualified for asylum last year, to be selected for more detailed consideration. Of course, all refused claims will continue to attract a right of appeal to an independent adjudicator.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. Can we, between now and the Report stage, look at the specific issue I raised? I take the point that we cannot ensure that every individual would be free of persecution--that would not be true of any country in the world--and I also take the point about the general level of persecution, but the particular cases I mentioned concern groups which are targeted specifically and individuals who are part of such groups. That is to say, it is not really individuals but a specific minority that is at risk. Will the Minister give some further consideration to that issue because it is a special case? It is not the same as a case of a country which has a generally good record but there may be one or two individuals who have been unfairly treated.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I was going to give an example to address that point. Without pre-empting too much of the debate which may come later, I intended to use India as an example because it was mentioned by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para0"></a>India is an established, pluralist democracy--as the noble Baroness would agree--with well-developed legal institutions. Most of India is generally peaceful and there is no evidence of significant persecution or abuse as defined in the United Nations convention. In 1995, 98 per cent. of asylum applications from Indian nationals were refused. We accept that two particular areas of India--the Punjab and Kashmir--have experienced human rights abuses. However, militant <P>


<a name="column_1068"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1068</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unrest in the Punjab has now largely subsided, and many fleeing the troubles in Kashmir have gone to other parts of India, as we would expect under the internal flight principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para1"></a>Applications from Kashmiris in this country are rare. Moreover, there are signs of improvement in Kashmir. The Indian Government intends to hold elections in the state, militant leaders have been released from prison, and the International Red Cross has now begun its first substantive visit to detention centres. India has a national Human Rights Commission to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para2"></a>So it is the case that generally the country is peaceful, it has democratic institutions in place, but within that great country there are groups of people who, for one reason or another, are subject to human rights abuses. I like to think that the way in which we have approached that question answers, in part, the point raised by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para3"></a>Reference was again made to the Glidewell Report, and to comments made by Judge Pearl, by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. Judge Pearl is reported to have told the Glidewell panel that the intake of the appellate authority currently exceeds its output, and that while this remains the position the need to give priority to increased numbers of certified cases will lead to longer waiting lists for other appeals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para4"></a>We listen very carefully to the Chief Adjudicator's advice. The Chief Adjudicator has presided over a remarkable expansion of capacity and output since his appointment, with the assistance of a major investment of resources, which is continuing. It is not the Government's position that wider use of the accelerated appeal procedure will of itself reduce overall delays, but we are convinced that it is a necessary part of a wider programme of measures. The package also includes major additional resources now being invested in the appeal system and the improved procedural rules on which the Lord Chancellor has just published proposals after consulting the Chief Adjudicator.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para5"></a>It is important to send, as a deterrent, a signal that unfounded claims will be dealt with speedily--fairly, but speedily--and if fewer such claims are thereby made overall delays will be reduced and genuine refugees will then receive asylum more quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para6"></a>It has to be said that Judge Pearl also told the Glidewell panel that the number of special adjudicators was being increased substantially, that the number of hearing rooms was being increased, that the asylum appeal procedure rules were being strengthened, and that there were government proposals that the adjudicator should be given important new powers to determine preliminary issues and issue procedural directions. These new measures were welcomed by Judge Pearl, and Clause 1 must be seen in the context of a wider package of measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para7"></a>I hope that I have given an explanation of the importance of the words "in general", of how we arrive at the view that countries should go on to the designated list, and some of the factors that we take into account. We also recognise the existence of the examples given by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. But underpinning all of <P>


<a name="column_1069"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1069</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this is the fact that, whatever country they come from--designated or otherwise--cases will be considered individually.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_time0"></A><H5>6.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   As to the last point that the Minister made about the evidence of Judge Pearl, as I said earlier, I was there and I heard his evidence, and I can confirm that what she said is right. He reported to the panel on the increase in the resources being made available to him, both in terms of numbers of adjudicators and space, and his hopes for improvement in the procedural rules. All that is true; it is very valuable and we welcome it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para8"></a>That leads me to say, however, that it is a pity that, as that session was so helpful, Ministers and officials of the Home Office--presumably on the instruction of Ministers--declined the invitation to appear before or provide written evidence to the Glidewell panel. The quality of our consideration of the Bill--certainly my consideration of the Bill--would have been better if Ministers had participated in what, after all, was a very effective and, as we shall see in the course of our debate, a very persuasive consideration of the issues raised by this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para9"></a>It still does not really answer the fundamental questions. The Minister's answers are summed up by her remark that the Bill deals with the level of the risk--and I interpret that as in a given country--rather than the risk to an individual. That is the key. It is a risk to an individual that we are concerned with.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para10"></a>Although of course the Minister is technically right in saying that every individual case will be considered, there is and must be a difference in the quality of the consideration between those under the fast track procedure and those under the normal procedure. That must be the case. If more time and effort is spent on determining whether the application or the appeal is justified, then there must be a higher quality of consideration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. There is absolutely no distinction whatsoever in the quality of the consideration of the substantive case. The distinction arises in the length of the appeal process once a determination as to whether somebody qualifies for asylum or refugee status has been made. But the distinction is not there at all; every single asylum application is considered substantively in exactly the same way, whether the applicant comes from a designated or non-designated country. It is only following the decision resulting from that substantive consideration that there is a distinction in the appeals system.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   In that case it is very difficult to see what is being gained. We have to distinguish between the original application and the appeal. It is true that everybody is still entitled to an appeal--and we will come on to the issue of the further appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in later amendments.
<P>


<a name="column_1070"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1070</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para11"></a>In the case of an individual applicant, the whole process, as far as that applicant is concerned, consists of the way in which the application is considered and the way in which any appeal is considered. Taking those two together, there is a difference--and there must be a difference--in the quality of consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para12"></a>The Minister did not answer my questions about what was meant by "in general". She did not say whether it meant that the minorities were isolated, or that it related to individuals rather than groups. She did not say whether it was concerned with the severity of the persecution. None of that was answered, either in her general response to what I said or in her response to the particular issues which other noble Lords raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para13"></a>The words "in general" are designed not to clarify but to obfuscate the issue. They are designed to make the distinction between the countries which are on the list and those which are not easier to manipulate rather than more just.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-16_para14"></a>The Minister went so far as to say that the words "in general" were needed in order to justify the designation. If that is the case, it is the classic circular argument. If one has decided to have a designation and then one decides to make a distinction between countries which are designated or not, then one has to find a form of words which justifies making a distinction. I listened to what the Minister said about the general political considerations. I understand them and, to some extent, I respect them, but she has not justified the words "in general". Those words are dangerous for individual applicants because they generalise the position in individual countries and they should be got rid of. I seek the opinion of the Committee on this amendment.

<A NAME = "60423-17_time0"></A><H5>6.29 p.m. </H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 16, at end insert ("for the reasons stated by the appellant").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-17_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 5 is a comparable but different approach to the same problem of the imprecision of the designation procedure. I shall not be very happy if I am told in response to the amendment that the designation procedure requires imprecision if it is to take effect at all. If the Government required imprecision as a precondition of having the designation procedure, it would be much better if they gave up the designation procedure, because imprecision in designation is the key to injustice so far as concerns individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-17_para1"></a>We suggest that in line 16 of the new clause there should be inserted, after the phrase "in general so serious risk of persecution", the words "for the reasons stated by the appellant". It may not be immediately obvious what that means. It means that the appellant has to state the reasons, but the precondition of the appellant stating reasons is that the Government have to state reasons. It is not enough for them to designate a country in the list; they have to say that it is based on an issue in the country rather than the country itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-17_para2"></a>I give an example. A number of noble Lords have referred to Pakistan. It may be that an appellant from Pakistan says that he is a supporter of the Pakistan People's Party, which is the opposition party in Pakistan, and that he hears threatening noises. I believe that a great number of us would say that if an individual was a member of an opposition party--noble Lords opposite should listen to this because they will experience it--he might be discriminated against in all kinds of ways. In certain circumstances such an individual may be persecuted or even prosecuted. However, that is not the same as justifying refugee status. If as a Member of the Opposition in this country I went to another country and said that I was being persecuted, I do not believe that too much attention <P>


<a name="column_1073"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1073</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be paid to me. Of course, there are reasons why people in Pakistan can be persecuted. Reasons have been given. Membership of religious minorities is the classic example. Another example is membership of the Roma people in eastern Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-17_para3"></a>What we say in this amendment--which we believe is helpful to the Government--is that they can be more precise in their designation because they can say that a country is on the list not just tout court because it is on the list, but that there are specific reasons for it. On that basis, it may be possible for them to extend the list. They may say that Pakistan, which would not normally be on the list--we have the Minister's assurance that it would not be--could be included provided the reason for an application reflected genuine persecution, but not for other reasons. One would have a much more sensitive list, and perhaps a longer one, that paid more attention to the needs of individuals. The appellant would have to show that he was appealing not only because of the country he came from but because the reason did not fall in with the Government's grounds for exclusion. Otherwise, we would face the same problem discussed on the last amendment. Complex cases will clog the fast track and the appeal system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-17_para4"></a>One of my objections to the whole designation procedure is that it has a built-in inaccuracy and tendency to generalisation. That inaccuracy may appear to be justified on the ground that the cost of the original applications under the fast track will be less than they would otherwise be. I suggest to the Committee that in the end the adjudicators would have to rule whether the procedure was correctly dealt with under the fast track. That in turn will give grounds for more appeals and expenditure on the appeal procedure. I cannot say whether it would cancel out any other savings, but certainly it would seriously reduce them. Above all, the generalisation involved in the designation procedure will produce injustice for individuals. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Amendment No. 5 envisages that the Secretary of State should produce a list of grounds which do not give rise to a serious risk of persecution in a particular country. If an applicant then based his claim on one of those grounds, a certificate could be applied on refusing the application, but certification would not be available if the claim was based on a ground not contained in the order. The scope for abuse would be enormous. We consider that such an approach would be unworkable. First, it would not be feasible for the Secretary of State to specify in his designation order an exhaustive list of grounds or scenarios which would not give rise to a serious risk of persecution. Every single case is different and must be considered on its merits. Secondly, the Bill as drafted prevents designation if there is a serious risk of persecution for any of the reasons specified by the 1951 convention, namely race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Thirdly, the designation concept would be undermined and present real scope for abuse if applicants could bypass it simply by including in their claim a spurious ground which was not specified in the Secretary of State's order. Even if he could not demonstrate that the ground applied in his <P>


<a name="column_1074"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1074</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>case, the applicant could prevent the Secretary of State from issuing a certificate. Under our approach there would be no opportunity for such evasion. Therefore, I hope that the amendment will not be pressed.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-18.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That was a very short reply. I believe there were two critical words in the Minister's reply, the first of which was "exhaustive". I certainly did not claim that the Secretary of State could produce an exhaustive list of grounds for application which would be included in a designated list. Even if it were exhaustive at one time, it would not be exhaustive over a period of time. Anything which improves on the blanket consideration--one is either in or out of the country--is better than the existing situation, or the situation as proposed by the Bill. The second significant word used by the Minister was "spurious". The noble Baroness said that it would be easy for an appellant to put forward a spurious ground because of knowledge of the list which had been produced by the Government in relation to that country. If one devises a scheme entirely on the basis that people will tell lies, either one needs an extremely simple system which excludes everybody or a rather complicated one which attempts to anticipate the lies and deal with them. I suggest to the Minister that the word "spurious" does not mean that anybody can just claim anything that he likes on a spurious basis and expect to get away with it. That would not be possible. It would be possible immediately to identify that the ground specified by the appellant did not bear any relation to reality. The Secretary of State could then genuinely refuse a certificate. I am not convinced by the answer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. The noble Lord is wrong about that. If an applicant, whether it applied to him or not, could find a reason that was not specified by the Home Secretary, then he could claim that reason. It would mean that he could not be given a certificate. So the reason could be used, and the scope for using it would be considerable, because it actually by-passes and short-circuits the system.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I find that answer to be in conflict with what the Minister said in her first reply about the protection which already exists under the 1951 convention. This is an issue which is relatively close to that which the Committee has already decided. So I do not believe that it is appropriate to seek the opinion of the Committee. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para0"></a>Amendment No. 5, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 16, at end insert (", but no such order shall include Bulgaria").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I had rather hoped to cut this discussion short by speaking about Bulgaria on the earlier amendment, but, since the noble Baroness did not so much as mention Bulgaria in her reply to that amendment to leave out the words "in general", I shall <P>


<a name="column_1075"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1075</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have, not to repeat what I have already said, but to underline some of the points that I was making and show how they conflict with the answer that she gave on that occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para2"></a>I would remind the Members of the Committee that this is the only occasion we have for discussing individual countries, because, when the first designation order comes before the House, we will have to vote on them altogether, even though we might make speeches which are directed towards the inclusion on the list of particular countries. One way of cutting short the next sequence of debates would be for the Minister to say that, instead of having an omnibus designation order when the time comes, the Secretary of State will introduce individual designation orders country by country, even if they are all tabled for debate on one occasion. That would be a way in which the Members of the Committee would be able to vote against the inclusion of a particular country on the list, something which otherwise will not be possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para3"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, the Minister gave some general criteria which would be applied in deciding whether to include a country on the list. Two of them that I noted particularly were: adherence to international obligations and the availability of avenues of redress. In the case of international obligations, I should like to draw the attention of Members of the Committee to the OSCE's Copenhagen Declaration which goes beyond conferring individual rights on members of minorities and actually places a positive obligation on the participating states of the OSCE to promote the identity of their minorities, to allow them to form associations, to link up with corresponding minorities of other countries, to create institutions, and so on. None of that happens in the case of Bulgaria. I mentioned the disallowance of the religious registration of a number of sects--a point which the Minister has not yet covered--and, in particular, the persecution of adherence of the original chief mufti, Fikri Sali and his replacement by a person who was a stooge of the old communist regime.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para4"></a>I do not know whether the Home Office is aware of that, because it seemed to be a matter that was not familiar to the Foreign Office. As my noble friend Lady Williams said on an earlier amendment, there seems to be some lack of communication between the Foreign Office and the Home Office, whatever the Minister may have replied to that point. In the case of Bulgaria, there was a distinct ignorance about the state of affairs of the minorities, not just of the Roma, who have been at the centre of attention so far. They do not actually know about the position of the religious minorities, or of the others, such as the Turks and the Sinti, who are equally subject to persecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para5"></a>On the question of the availability of avenues of redress, specifically, the former chief mufti, Fikri Sali, did go to the Supreme Court. His application for restoration to his position was rejected on the ground that the creation of the new Supreme Council and the appointment of a chief mufti by the government was a matter within the discretion of the government and was not a matter for the Moslem community to settle on its own.
<P>


<a name="column_1076"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1076</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para6"></a>The criteria described by the Minister have been seriously violated in the case of Bulgaria, and it ought not to appear on any list. As this is the only opportunity we shall have to debate the matters specifically, in distinction from any other country that may appear on the list, I venture to suggest that the Committee should take the opportunity of striking it off the list at this stage. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_time0"></A><H5>6.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Anyone who considers Bulgaria in the context of this Bill will almost immediately think of the Bulgarian atrocities. Of course, the point is that now the boot is on the other foot, but that does illustrate that there are some very long-term tensions in Bulgaria--long-term tensions on a level such that one does not expect them to disappear instantly. One hopes to see them diminish, but it is perfectly possible to imagine a situation in which Bulgarian Turks could have a well-founded fear of persecution, even if there might be, in general, no well-founded fear of persecution in Bulgaria as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para7"></a>My noble friend was quite right to draw attention to the relevance of this case to the misguidedness of the words "in general". I am glad that he has tabled the amendment, and I hope that it will receive attention.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I am a little puzzled about something that the Minister said in reply to an earlier amendment, but it is equally relevant to this one. What I have in front of me is a Home Office document called Asylum and Immigration Bill Background Notes by the Home Office. The Minister said that even if people are on a fast-track procedure, their case is still considered in the same detail--I am not sure that those were her exact words--as people who are not on the fast-track procedure. That is the substance of what the Minister said. Obviously, it is as relevant to this amendment as to others. I am therefore puzzled that, in this background paper by the Home Office, it says in the paragraph headed, "Introduction":
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Applications for asylum from citizens of designated countries would be subject to streamlined substantive consideration and to an accelerated appeals process". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para8"></a>I am puzzled as to what the words, "streamlined substantive consideration" mean. I should have thought that they mean that, in some way, the consideration on that basis is less thorough than for other cases; otherwise, there would be no point in using those three words, and there would have been no point in putting them into this particular paper. I say that I am puzzled because the Minister suggested that it was only the subsequent stages that were speeded up under the fast-track procedure, and it was not the way in which the full case would be considered. I hope that we can have some comment from the Minister as to whether I am right in saying that there is an inconsistency between what she said earlier and what the document says.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   Bulgaria is a civilised country. It is civilised enough to have been accepted as a member of the Council of Europe. We should not forget that. After all, there are many minority problems and we cannot be the conscience of the world.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-18_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, wishes to prohibit the Secretary of State from designating certain countries. We think that that is wrong in principle and because we disagree with his assessment of the four countries concerned. We have heard about Bulgaria and, no doubt, we shall hear later of the other countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-18_para9"></a>I have to say, as somebody handling the Bill, that I have had something like five different sets of groupings for the amendments today. I find it extremely difficult that only part-way through the proceedings this afternoon did I know that we were going to deal with these amendments singly.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am very sorry about the way in which this matter occurred. As the noble Baroness knows, until I walked into the Chamber this afternoon, I was not aware that the four amendments had been grouped together. I tabled them individually and it was clear that my intention in doing so was to have a separate debate on each of the countries concerned because it will not be possible to do so later.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I accept entirely the personal explanation which the noble Lord gives. We have been in touch constantly with the noble Lord's parliamentary office and until I walked into the Chamber today I thought that the groupings had been agreed. I am afraid that the noble Lord must take up the matter with his office.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para0"></a>I do not accept that the Bill should list countries whose designation is prohibited. If the Secretary of State considers a country unsuitable for designation, he will simply not designate it. If Parliament is not content with an order tabled by the Secretary of State, as I said earlier, it can vote against it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para1"></a>We have accepted the recommendation of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee that the initial designation order should be by affirmative procedure in both Houses. Therefore, we shall have an opportunity to debate the suitability of the countries listed and to vote on the order. Any subsequent order will be laid before Parliament under the negative procedure.

<A NAME = "60423-19_para2"></a>The noble Lord's proposal would also undesirably blur the distinction between primary and secondary legislation. Conditions in countries of origin may change over time. Countries which are unsuitable for designation at present may become much safer in the future. That is why we need the flexibility provided by secondary legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para3"></a>If we did construct a list of countries where there are at present significant risks of persecution or danger to people living in them, it would not be the list suggested by the noble Lord. Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan are examples of countries where repressive regimes or major upheavals have made it necessary to grant asylum <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>or exceptional leave in significant numbers of cases. Yet they do not appear on the noble Lord's list, which studiously avoids genuinely dangerous countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para4"></a>The situation in the countries we intend to designate is one of substantial safety and security. That does not mean that they are entirely without problems, as I said earlier, or that genuine cases of persecution will never arise. It would be unrealistic to insist on universal safety and, indeed, such a requirement is unnecessary, given the safeguards which will continue to apply under the Bill. Designation will allow us to deal more quickly and effectively with the great majority of applicants who do not qualify for asylum. But the procedures used will enable exceptional cases, such as the very small number from the seven countries that qualified for asylum last year, to be selected out for more detailed consideration. And, of course, all refused claims will continue to attract a right of appeal to an independent adjudicator.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para5"></a>I do not accept that Bulgaria is unsuitable for designation. Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of democracy, particularly following the April 1990 Law on Political Groups and Parties. Bulgaria's National Assembly is a democratically elected body and recent elections have been declared free and fair by international observers. Bulgaria is a party to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Bulgarian Government are committed to obtaining membership of the European Union, as my noble friend said. We do not accept that past mistreatment of minorities by the former communist regime justifies a presumption of future mistreatment. We recognise that there is discrimination against some minorities within local communities, including the Roma minority. But the Bulgarian Government have taken steps to address these problems and to prosecute offenders. Last year, 99 per cent. of applications for asylum were refused. Although the vast majority of Bulgarian asylum applications are unfounded, each application is considered individually and asylum will be granted when the circumstances warrant it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para6"></a>Bulgaria's present problems are mainly economic, with fairly high unemployment and inflation, a high budget deficit, foreign debt problems and a rising level of crime. It would appear that the economic situation coupled with greater freedom of movement has contributed to the number of asylum applications.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para7"></a>Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of democracy in Bulgaria, particularly following the April 1990 Law on Political Groups and Parties. Chapter 2 of the constitution, which took effect on 13th July 1991, establishes the basic provisions for Bulgarian citizenship and fundamental human rights. Furthermore, it commits the state to the provision of basic social welfare and education and to the encouragement of culture, science and the health of the population.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para8"></a>Freedom of movement within the country and the right to leave it are constitutionally enshrined and not limited in practice. Every citizen has the right to return to Bulgaria. A number of former political emigrants were granted passports in 1994 and returned to visit or live there.

<A NAME = "60423-19_para9"></a>There are many ethnic minorities in Bulgaria. In July 1991, the country adopted a new constitution which provides for individual rights, equality and protection against discrimination. Bulgaria still has some progress to make in its treatment of minorities (particularly the Roma/gypsies), and racism and xenophobia still exist, but much progress has been made across the whole range of human rights since the fall of the communist regime.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para10"></a>There is some resentment of gypsies and incidents against them such as illegal detention, search and seizure and general harassment are known to occur. It has been reported that the police are frequently either the perpetrators of violence against such people or fail to intervene when attacks are instigated. However, the Government have introduced reforms in order to address many of these problems, including investigating and prosecuting charges of excessive use of force by police; programmes to hire gypsies as police officers; programmes to improve relations between the Romany community and local police, and job and literacy training for gypsies. Where ill-treatment by local authorities and communities continues, there is no evidence that this is condoned at a national level. Popular feeling does exist against gypsies but this is not condoned at a national level and perpetrators of attacks are prosecuted if caught.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para11"></a>I could go on about Bulgaria. As we have said, there is certainly a case for individuals to prove their case and provision is made for them in the proposed system, but to say that Bulgaria is as bad as the picture painted by the noble Lord is rather over-stating the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-19_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked about the streamline consideration. That refers to the short procedure introduced by the Home Office last year. It does not require legislation and does not detract from full consideration. It involves shorter intervals before interview and between interview and decision. That is consistent with all that I have said previously on the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME="60423-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, will she confirm that Bulgaria is a member of the Council of Europe and is now a high contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights? Anybody persecuted in Bulgaria has the right to go to the European Court and appeal against any persecution or violation of rights against individuals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for making that point because she is absolutely right. I made the point that Bulgaria is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. That is a point very well worth making.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-19_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Baroness is correct about the Council of Europe. It is true also that Russia is now a member of the Council of Europe but I might be anxious if I were a Chechen living in Russia. I am perfectly well aware that we have not designated Chechnya. But the point to which I return over and over again, because the point in logic keeps recurring, is that the fact that a country may be safe for the majority of its citizens does not mean that it is safe for all of them. I should like to <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I must say unequivocally that we have never stated that any country is absolutely safe for all its citizens. That is one reason why we have used the words "in general". We make a presumption that even those countries which are designated will necessarily have well-proven cases of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution. The system is geared to sort out the genuine asylum seekers from those who have come from countries where there is in general no threat to the population. However, we have never claimed that there is any country which is wholly safe for all of its people.

I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for those comments because they advance the job of defining the points at issue. But we are here subjecting the nationals of some countries to a different procedure from those we use for the nationals of other countries. I think that on Second Reading the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, used the phrase I am about to use. We have a rebuttable presumption that claims from those countries are less likely to be well-founded than those from others. I should be grateful if we could have an explanation of how that is to be squared with Article 3 of the UN convention which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The contracting states shall apply the provisions of this convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion--" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME="60423-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I am a little worried that pragmatism--which I realise is rather a dirty word in these debates--seems almost to have been forgotten. For example, the right reverend Prelate referred to the generosity of Canada. I happen to know from visits I have had from Vancouver in connection with educational matters that there is considerable resentment of Chinese people in Vancouver, to the extent that a number of schools are imposing quotas. I was even more alarmed when the noble Earl, Lord Russell, started to extend the provision to almost--dare I say?--every minority in the world. I do not think that anyone in this Chamber, Christian 'though many of us are, envisages this country becoming a refuge for minorities who suffer certain problems.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The noble Lord appears to be speaking to an amendment that we discussed earlier which proposed to strike out the words "in general". We are now supposed to be discussing Bulgaria.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I thought that Chechnya was mentioned in the debate. However, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, knows as well as I, historically <P>


<a name="column_1081"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1081</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bulgaria has had problems. There is a Turkish minority there. In no sense is it envisaged that if a problem arises--such as has arisen in Cyprus--we should admit large numbers of that Turkish minority into this kingdom. If the party opposite were in government, I prophesy that it would not open the frontiers of this country to the Turkish minority in Bulgaria. Please let us not forget pragmatism. Let us talk about morality, but let us mean to implement that. Does the party opposite intend to repeal this legislation? Does it intend to follow the noble Lord's proposal, and, if there is a problem in Bulgaria--or, dare I say, in other parts of the Balkans--to open the frontiers of this country? Would the party opposite stand for election on that platform? These are matters that we must think through before we talk about them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Lord listened carefully to the earlier part of this debate. No one is proposing to open the door to minorities. What we are discussing now is the proposal to delete Bulgaria from the putative list designating certain countries as subject to the fast track procedure which is to be published by the Secretary of State. If I may say so, I thought that it was disingenuous of the Minister to accuse me of not tabling similar amendments on Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan when she knows perfectly well that those are not the countries which the Secretary of State intends to place on the list. The four countries which are the subjects of these amendments are countries in respect of which the Secretary of State has notified his intention of dealing with by means of the list. That was why I thought it wise to allow the Committee the opportunity to at least consider each of them individually to see whether it was our intention that such countries should be placed on the list, or at least to give some warning to the Secretary of State that he should consider these matters a little more carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para0"></a>The Minister is naive as well as disingenuous in thinking that because a country holds elections and has a constitution it necessarily respects human rights, either in a domestic or an international context. I refer her to the United States Department of State report on Bulgaria of 1995. I shall read a couple of sentences from that report. It states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The constitution provides for freedom of religion. However the Government restrict this right in practice. The ability of a number of religious groups to operate freely continues to come under attack both as a result of Government action and because of public intolerance". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para1"></a>As for the measures in the constitution which allow political parties and other groups to function freely, I asked the Minister in an earlier debate whether she would comment on the government's refusal, since 1990, to allow a Macedonian rights group to be registered, as an example of the incompatibility of Bulgaria's actual behaviour with what is stated in the constitution. I can point to examples all over the world where governments have fine constitutions but they do not bother to abide by them. One should take a look at the old Soviet constitution which was full of material about its citizens' human rights but it did not bother to observe those human rights. The Minister and her right <P>


<a name="column_1082"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1082</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>honourable friend ought to think about this matter carefully, if the principal argument for placing a country on this list is to be that it has a constitution, that it runs elections, or even that it has been allowed to enter the Council of Europe. There are many states in the Council of Europe which I would not have admitted. We discussed Turkey earlier. Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and yet no one would conceivably suggest that Turkey should be placed on the list for designation. I think the noble Baroness has said that there is no such intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para2"></a>I had rather hoped to receive a better explanation of the reasons why Bulgaria appeared on the list, and that the Minister could have addressed the problems of the religious minorities, which she totally ignored. She mentioned that some measures had been taken to address the matter of the Roma minority. I think that she did not refer to the Turks or the Sinti, let alone the Macedonians. However, the religious minorities are one of the most important subjects as regards the complaints that are made by the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, as I said in my earlier speech. I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's remarks. She has not justified placing Bulgaria on the list. However, for the time being, I shall not ask Members of the Committee to accompany me into the Division Lobby because we all need to reflect on what has been said by the Minister and to decide whether we want to pursue this matter at a later stage in the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the amendment is withdrawn, if that is the intention of the noble Lord, I should say that I responded to this amendment. The noble Lord wishes to put on the face of this Bill, which is primary legislation, the names of four countries which should not be considered for designation. I am simply saying that there are better candidates, if one were going to do that. We do not believe that this is the place for that provision because we have said what procedure we intend to put in place for considering designated countries. However, if we thought that there were four countries that were of such concern to the Committee that it wished to state on the face of the Bill that those countries should never be considered for designation, we should not have chosen those particular four countries. I have named other countries that I believe would rank rather higher.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para3"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, asked about the UNHCR. The UNHCR has made clear that it does not regard designation as inherently incompatible with the 1951 convention provided that claims are still considered on their merits. I have said many times today that claims will be considered on their merits. We are satisfied that there is no inconsistency with Article 3 which is concerned with the treatment of persons who have been granted refugee status. In the particular case to which I have referred, certification applies only after a refusal has been given to an asylum seeker. That means that we are entirely consistent with our obligations under the convention.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I do not know whether the Minister is being deliberately obtuse, but I have just explained why I put these amendments down, and not amendments <P>


<a name="column_1083"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1083</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerning Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan. It is because the Home Secretary intends to designate these countries; and there is no question of him doing so as regards the other three countries to which she referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para4"></a>I am at a loss to know how the Minister suggests that the Committee would have had an opportunity to discuss the matter if I had not put down these specific amendments, although technically primary legislation may not be the right way to deal with the matter. I am giving the Committee an opportunity to say whether we consider that these specific countries should be included in the list to which the Home Secretary has already referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para5"></a>The explanation given by the Minister as to why Bulgaria should be included in that list falls well short of what I would expect. She did not once refer to the religious minorities who were at the centre of the remarks that I made on an earlier occasion.

Line 16, at end insert (", but no such order shall include Ghana").

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that we shall have a better explanation of the reasons why Ghana was included in the list than we had as regards Bulgaria.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para9"></a>In Ghana there is no question of the discrimination or the persecution being particular, although there are, of course, ethnic minorities in Ghana. I shall come to those later. Ghana is a state which has been ruled by President Jerry Rawlings for 15 years. He took power, unelected, as head of state. That was a position that he occupied for 11 years, until he finally allowed the people to vote him back into power in an election which was denounced as fraudulent by four opposition parties. Those parties then withdrew from the parliamentary elections of December 1992 giving Rawlings' coalition a walkover. It is, in effect, still a one party state, despite the elections to which the Minister attaches so much importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para10"></a>According to the US State Department, the Government dominate the print and electronic media, and control the radio and television stations and the two daily newspapers. The media never criticise President Rawlings or government policies. Although independent broadcasting is allowed in theory, bureaucratic delays in processing applications are used to prevent it in practice. When the Independent Media Corporation of Ghana started broadcasting without a licence, having waited for a year to obtain one, the police seized the transmission equipment and hung on to it in defiance of a High Court ruling that they had acted illegally.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para11"></a>There is an independent newspaper sector, but the circulations are small and confined to the major cities. The papers do criticise, but are vulnerable to the law on criminal libel--it is applied with particular severity in Ghana--under which a person may be prosecuted for <P>


<a name="column_1084"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1084</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>publishing a false report which injures or damages the credit or reputation of the state. One victim of that legislation at present is my friend Mr. Kwesi Pratt, editor of the Weekly Insight and General Secretary of the Popular Party for Democracy and Development. He has been charged and faces either a prison sentence or a huge fine which could bankrupt him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para12"></a>In May 1995 the Minister of Youth and Sports organised a gang of thugs who killed four people taking part in a peaceful demonstration against the new value added tax. The Government refused to commission an independent inquiry into the deaths, but in September they announced that a police committee had been unable to identify the murderers. The committee's report was not published.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para13"></a>It is reported that ethnic violence, which resulted in 20,000 deaths in the northern region in 1994, continued into 1995, though in the latter year only 150 people died. One reason for that lower death toll was that the Konkomba people--they were the principal victims of the ethnic conflict--were no longer going into the larger towns and cities where the conflicts had occurred, and had fled into Togo. According to the UNHCR's report, The State of the World's Refugees 1995, there were 97,700 refugees from Ghana in Togo and another 15,900 elsewhere in the region. Some of those people were victims of ethnic violence, but many others are conscientious objectors and political dissidents, as well as people from the Eze tribe of the Volta region which straddles the frontier between Ghana and Togo. Many of the refugees do not bother to register--there are probably far more than the official figure of 113,000 given by the UNHCR--as happens elsewhere in Africa. So how can it be said that Ghana is a country where there is in general no serious risk of persecution if at least 113,000 people are officially classified as refugees by the UNHCR?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para14"></a>If one considers the mainstream politics of Ghana as opposed to the ethnic conflict, the UNHCR noted in November 1995 that although it was asserted that the achievement of a "controlled" transition to a democracy had been extensive, it was less clear whether the transition would continue in view of the precarious political and social foundation on which it was based. Ghanakwambo, the Refugees and Migrants Community Action Group in the UK, points out that,

On the date that the group published a memorandum about the inclusion of Ghana in the list, two journalists and a publisher were on trial for "bringing the state into disrepute". According to the Ghanaian Chronicle of 26th February, when the three appeared at a circuit court on 23rd February, there was a display of thuggery in the precincts of the court, with armed men hurling insults and abuse at anybody they perceived as being anti-NDC (the governing party). Miss Ruby Ofori, a BBC correspondent, had to be rescued by the police and Ms. Adwoa Yeboah-Afari, another BBC correspondent, was also chased by the same thugs.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para15"></a>Mr. Rawlings himself can be aggressive and violent. I spoke to a man this morning who has been in the UK since 1989 waiting for a decision on his asylum application. He told me that in November 1992, when he was at the house of the then Minister of Youth and Sports, Rawlings arrived in a helicopter with a group of men armed with AK47s. There had been an attempted coup the previous day. Perhaps Mr. Rawlings thought that a plot against his rule was being hatched in that building. He came in shouting and screaming at the inmates of the house. My informant says that Mr. Rawlings threatened them all, making them kneel down at gunpoint, shouting "On your fucking knees". That is the conduct of the head of state of Ghana. Members of the Committee may have some difficulty in believing that a person in that position could behave in such a crude and vicious manner. But there are many similar stories about his irrational conduct, and the unceremonious treatment of anyone who gets in his way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para16"></a>The most recent event of that kind about which I know personally was Rawlings' attack on his own vice-president, Dr. K.N. Arkaah, at a cabinet meeting on 28th December 1995. Dr. Arkaah telephoned me on 1st January this year to give me details of what had happened. He said that the president was angry because Dr. Arkaah's National Convention Party had held a very successful meeting at Kumasi two weeks earlier at which it was decided to bring the alliance between his party and the Government to an end. At that cabinet meeting, everyone was in his place at 10.20 waiting for the president to arrive. They stood as the president came in at 10.30. He went to the chair next to Vice-President Arkaah and started speaking from behind his chair. Suddenly Dr. Arkaah felt a tremendous blow from behind which knocked him to the ground. The president started to kick him as he lay there, screaming epithets at him such as, "You bastard". Dr. Arkaah did not reply or retaliate in any way. He is a much smaller man than the president.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para17"></a>According to Amnesty International, five Ghanaians who had recently returned to Ghana from the UK were arrested on 2nd September 1994 and charged with plotting a coup. I wrote to the Minister about this case. The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, said that in deciding to refuse those people bail after they had been 17 months in custody the authorities would no doubt have taken into account the seriousness of the charges. But the Minister seems to have accepted that it was normal that evidence was still being collected after such a length of time. Relatives trying to visit two of the people in the Usher Fort, where they had been detained previously, were told that they had been transferred to Mwasam maximum security prison. When they went there, the authorities said that they had never heard of the detainees. So we must assume that they are missing. The brother of one of them was taken into custody and interrogated in connection with the plot. When he was released, the family saw that he had been tortured: all his teeth were missing, he had bruises all over his face and he was bleeding from his mouth. They took him to hospital and he died there two days later.

<A NAME = "60423-20_para18"></a>The atmosphere of paranoia in Ghana is indicated by the fact that two other groups of people are also in custody for alleged coup plots. One was a group of soldiers and a Captain Mumuni Seidu; the other a group of five farmers who had been living in exile in Togo. According to the Refugee Council, the farmers had been beaten and tortured.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-20_para19"></a>Ghana has been described by the Home Office as a fledgling democracy. If its research is as slipshod and selective on Ghana as it was on Nigeria, it is no wonder that it misses so much of what is going on there. Sometimes, when we raise concerns over human rights with Foreign Office Ministers, we are told that it does not have the resources to investigate most of the allegations received. That may be part of the problem. We are getting an inadequate and incomplete picture of human rights in many of the countries which allows us to say that no risk arises in a particular country. In the case of Ghana, that is manifestly untrue and the Secretary of State should indicate that he does not intend to place that country on the list. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I make the point that we need to make the distinction between the country in general for designation purposes and the individual case. The noble Lord has spoken almost exclusively on individual cases and those will have a proper and fair hearing. That is as it should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para0"></a>Specifically on Ghana, major constitutional changes in 1992 returned the country to democratic civilian rule. The constitution now guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms and the rule of law. Membership of political parties is widespread and open. Most recent reports, including the 1995 US State Department report, indicate that there are no known political prisoners or detainees. Amnesty International has confirmed that there is no evidence of politically inspired disappearances since the return to democracy. We recognise that there have been outbreaks of friction between Christians and Moslems and longer standing friction between tribes in the northern region of Ghana. But the authorities have reacted promptly to contain the disorder and to restore peace and the rule of law. Despite those conditions, 1,900 asylum claims were received last year, almost all of which were unfounded.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para1"></a>I wish to comment on all the aspects referred to by the noble Lord. Government economic policies in Ghana since the mid-1980s have resulted in financial stringencies for most of the population. It has to be said that the average per capita annual national income is still only about &#163;300. Employment opportunities are scarce and qualified professional workers can expect salary levels which compare badly with remuneration for even menial jobs in the developed world.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>largely free and fair by international observers. Parliamentary elections were boycotted by the main opposition parties, with the result that the present government were elected almost without opposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para4"></a>International monitoring of the 1992 elections by teams of observers, including representatives from the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the Carter Centre, concluded that despite some irregularities, largely caused by the out-of-date and inaccurate voters' register, the elections were free and fair. A new voters' register has been compiled for the 1996 elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para5"></a>Membership of political parties is widespread and ordinary Ghanaians are not discouraged from joining the party of their choice or harassed for their political opinions. The constitution was introduced in January 1993, but political change had begun before that. Registration of voters to a new electoral roll took place in October 1995 and there has been considerable activity by opposition parties to select candidates to contest the elections which will take place in November and December this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para6"></a>The 1992 constitution, adopted on 7th January 1993, guarantees the fundamental human rights and freedoms of every Ghanaian citizen. There is no convincing evidence of widespread, systematic abuse of individuals' constitutional rights. Although there have been isolated reports of individuals abusing their authority, there is evidence that appropriate disciplinary or legal action has been taken against them and that victims who have suffered abuse of their human, civil or constitutional rights have received compensation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para7"></a>The 1995 US State Department report cited two instances which it described as extra-judicial killing of suspects in police custody. That was referred to by the noble Lord. In one case, the officers responsible have been suspended from duty pending the result of an investigation. In the other, the police were exonerated. It is not known whether a further reported death in custody is under investigation. Amnesty International has reported no politically motivated killings in its 1995 report.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para8"></a>The constitution of Ghana specifically guarantees respect for human dignity and prohibits torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Our assessment is that such treatment is neither systematically practised nor condoned by the authorities. Again, Amnesty International has reported no politically motivated disappearances since the introduction of the constitution. Our most recent information, including the 1995 US State Department report, indicates that there are no known political prisoners or detainees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para9"></a>One could go on, but the last point with which I wish to deal was touched on by the noble Lord. It concerns the independence of the media. The constitution guarantees the freedom and independence of the media. The National Media Commission was established to ensure and oversee that. The commission has a majority of members appointed by non-governmental interests, such as the Ghana Bar Association which has traditionally campaigned for civil rights, and the press, writers, educationists and religious groups. Although television and radio were state-owned, about 30 licences <P>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1088</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were granted in 1995 to establish free TV and radio stations. The government control the two main daily newspapers, but there is a lively free press. Some publications are owned by opposition parties. All, however, freely publish views highly critical of the government and individuals in it, often verging on the libellous. Foreign periodicals are freely available in Accra and in other major centres.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para10"></a>My final point is that Ghana has already been included in the list of countries designated by Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark. The noble Lord referred to many individual cases, all of which, if they came through the system, would be considered on their merits. If the individuals qualified for asylum under the 1951 convention, it would be granted. But for those who come seeking asylum, the practice is that the majority have not qualified.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Baroness is aware that she has erected an entirely circular argument. She has given us a country assessment which, at this time of night, I shall confine myself to calling "unexpected". Can she say who were the independent monitors to whom she referred? The Minister then advanced the fact that the vast majority of refugees from Ghana had not been accepted. She advanced those as if they were two entirely unconnected facts. The question is: are they two entirely unconnected facts or are they two entirely connected facts? The credibility of applicants is judged in relation to the country assessment. If the country assessment should by any awful chance be mistaken, many more applicants from that country will be found to be incredible than would otherwise be the case. That illustrates why we need the country assessments published so that we can consider and discuss them with people who have independent sources of information.

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para11"></a>I mention just three of the independent sources of advice: the United States State Department; the Carter Centre; and Amnesty International. I do not know whether the noble Lord has any criticisms of those organisations. I certainly believe that they are highly reputable in this field.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My noble friend did not say that he had any criticisms. He merely asked who the independent monitors were. That is a perfectly reasonable question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Harris, does not have the advantage that I have. I have listened to this debate from the beginning. There was an implied criticism that the independent monitors were not very independent. I am simply saying that I believe the three I cited--and there are others--are highly reputable in <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   I recently visited both urban and rural areas in Ghana. I spoke with parliamentarians and persons at grass-roots level. I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation and I shall support the Government on this particular issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Without knowing where the noble Viscount went, it is very difficult for me to comment. I draw his attention to a comment I made earlier, which the Minister totally ignored; namely, that there are 97,500 refugees from Ghana in Togo, and 15,000 elsewhere in the region. Those people are recognised by the UNHCR as refugees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para12"></a>I asked the noble Baroness this question earlier, but I am afraid she did not address it. How can it be that UNHCR has recognised 113,000 refugees in the region--a fairly large number in relation to Ghana's population--if, as she says, no general risk of persecution arises in Ghana and that we can therefore legitimately place Ghana on the special list of countries that are not supposed to give rise to any refugees? I believe the term used by lawyers in such cases is: res ipsa loquitur--the facts speak for themselves. If there are 113,000 refugees in neighbouring countries, that means that Ghana must be a country that gives rise to a flow of people recognised by the UNHCR as coming within the 1951 convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-21_para13"></a>To repeat my remarks in relation to the earlier amendment, the noble Baroness again places far too much reliance on the existence of elections and constitutions. There are plenty of countries all over the world where elections are held but which do not observe human rights. Ghana is not the only one in that category. The Minister's quotations from the State Department report were selective. The State Department said that the elections were controversial; that the international monitors acknowledged irregularities; and that the four opposition parties claimed massive fraud in the elections and subsequently boycotted them.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I did say that the elections were controversial and that the opposition parties boycotted them. I also said that there were irregularities, mainly stemming from the very inaccurate and rather outdated register. I properly made both those points in the course of my remarks about Ghana.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   That was not the only subject of irregularity. Certainly I concede that the noble Baroness mentioned the registers. They were a source of vehement complaint by the opposition parties. However, it was by no means the only case that was made against the validity of the presidential elections, as the noble Baroness said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para0"></a>With regard to the rest of her comments, we rely on the State Department and Amnesty International. I was interested in her comment that both said that there were no known cases of disappearance in Ghana. I know that <P>


<a name="column_1090"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1090</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that was the case in relation to the State Department report. However, I am not familiar with the reference to any statement made by Amnesty International. Its annual report for 1995 has not yet appeared, and I believe will not do so until July or August of this year. I should therefore be very interested to know from where the noble Baroness received that information.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para1"></a>I spoke to the Ghana researcher from Amnesty International earlier today. Certainly that person did not tell me that, in the opinion of Amnesty International, there had been no disappearances. I quoted a case that came to my notice only today of two people alleged to have taken part in the coup plot who had been in custody for something like 20 months. They appear to have vanished while being moved from one prison to another. So at least one case of disappearance was drawn to the Minister's attention during the course of this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para2"></a>Clearly my earlier remarks made no impression on her; nor did they in the case of Bulgaria. I shall have to leave the comments made this afternoon to speak for themselves, and for the Committee to judge, in the light of cumulative evidence that has been and will be presented on the four countries with which we are dealing now, whether we shall seek to overturn the order to designate these countries when it is placed before the House.

<A NAME="60423-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 20th March be approved [15th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order prohibits fishing for salmon and migratory trout in the area designated, which covers rivers and streams in the counties of Dyfed and West Glamorgan. The main rivers affected are Solva, Western and Eastern Cleddau, Taf, Tywi, Gwendraeth Fach, Gwendraeth Fawr and Loughor. The order covers all rivers and streams which reach the sea between St. David's Head and Port Eynon Point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para7"></a>Noble Lords will know that, following the "Sea Empress" oil spill, we attempted to secure prohibition on salmon and sea trout fishing by means of voluntary arrangements. However, we could not be absolutely secure on that. Therefore, this order had to <P>


<a name="column_1091"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1091</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be put into place as a precautionary measure to ensure that consumer safety was fully protected at the start of the fishing season on 20th March.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para8"></a>The order prohibits the taking of salmon and sea trout, properly known as sewin, in those areas, and their movement, supply and sale. We considered whether other migratory fish should be included in the prohibition order. We were advised, however, that fish such as the twaite, shad and sea lamprey are both rare and not targeted by anglers; the allis shad is a protected species and did not require inclusion; eels, primarily caught in the lower parts of the rivers, were covered by the prohibition order covering sea fisheries; and eels in the freshwater area beyond are prohibited from being caught in the close season between 14th March and 16th June.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para9"></a>The Government of course understand the frustration and concern of leisure and hobby fishermen. It has been suggested that we could have made other arrangements to ensure the protection of food safety. But any other form of prohibition would still have contained an element of risk, and we could not enter into an arrangement where some loopholes continued to exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para10"></a>For instance, we felt that a "catch and release" scheme would have been difficult to police and enforce; it would also have caused confusion among fishermen. We could not be certain that some fish would not have ended up on the table.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para11"></a>We also considered whether it might have been possible to postpone the start of the fishing season; but any change would have involved protracted procedures for the introduction of new by-laws by the former National Rivers Authority; we could not afford the time to go through that process; this was an emergency incident requiring emergency powers to put in place urgent and secure action.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para12"></a>With the cold spring, the fish were late in starting their run and we were not able to catch any for testing until after 20th March. We have now managed to catch and test enough fish to give a clear picture of contamination. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the results are most encouraging. We are not quite yet in a position to revoke this order, but we expect to be able to do so in the near future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para13"></a>The House will know that these rivers are of significant economic value; the Government share the House's concern that restrictions should be removed at the earliest possible moment. Anglers and fisheries owners have shown considerable restraint and forbearance at this difficult time. Equally, they and we are anxious to ensure that the ban is removed only when we are satisfied that no danger exists and that the renowned reputation in this area for high quality fishing and food is maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para14"></a>We are clearly concerned about economic losses and I welcome the fact that fishermen have organised a compensation fund claims panel to deal with the insurers. That covers the order at hand. I do not doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will have some questions to ask me; but, for the moment, I beg leave to move the order. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "60423-22_para15"></a>Moved, That the order laid before the House on 20th March be approved [15th Report from the Joint Committee].--(Lord Lucas.)
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for his explanation and in particular the words he was able to say towards the end of his introduction which shows that substantially more optimistic conclusions can be drawn today than were available in another place on 2nd April when the order was before another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para16"></a>The rivers in question include the Cleddau and the Taf--not the Taff, which is the river that runs into Cardiff--the Tywi, the Gwendraeth Fach, the Gwendraeth Fawr and the Llwchwr. Those--in particular the Tywi--are extremely important to the economy of West Wales. The Salmon and Sea Trout magazine recently described the Tywi as the best salmon and sewin river in Britain. Few who have fished on it would doubt that that is correct. Thousands of local people depend on fishing and fishing-related activities. The estimate of value to the local economy is in the region of between &#163;5 million and &#163;10 million a year. It is very helpful to hear what the Minister said; but the fishing season on the Tywi, for instance, starts in March and finishes in October.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para17"></a>This is my specific question: is it the Government's policy that anyone who suffers loss as a result of the "Sea Empress" and in consequence of this order should be compensated fairly and properly? I believe that is the Government's policy. Therefore I need to refine my question in this way. What is the precise basis of compensation going to be? What are the parameters which the Government consider appropriate? What about, for instance, those who have already bought their fishing permits--which are extremely expensive--for a season which is going to be curtailed? Are the owners of riparian rights going to be compensated; amateur anglers' associations; restaurant owners; those who run hotels and guest houses in the area; people who make their livelihood from fishing tackle shops?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para18"></a>There is quite a span of activity composed in those questions, I well understand. If the Minister feels that he would rather write to me, I equally understand that because of course the situation is changing day by day. But this has been a catastrophe to the local economy as well as to the local ecology. Is the Minister able to indicate at all the period of time which is likely to elapse before the order can be revoked? A part of the season has gone, not the best part I concede, but is it anticipated that the order will be withdrawn certainly before the September run of sewin? These are very important questions. As I said earlier I quite understand that the detail may not be available readily and I am perfectly happy with a written response. Other than that, I have no further observations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, to reply to the second question first, the phrase I used was "in the near future" and that was intended to mean in the near future as ordinarily used by English people and not as ordinarily used by government spokesmen. If I were to promise to write to the noble Lord there would be a reasonable <P>


<a name="column_1093"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1093</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expectation that the order would be off before the letter arrived, given the length of time it normally takes to get letters out of the Government. So I hope for good news on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para19"></a>Samples of salmon and sea trout collected from the rivers affected by the order show only low levels of total hydrocarbons concentration and there is no sign of "Sea Empress" Forties Crude. We are encouraged by that. The chemical analysis of the sampling regime is being complemented by taint testing by panels of taste experts. I can report that they are having a great deal of pleasure from some very well cooked sewin in particular, and this work is also showing an encouraging outcome. When this is complete, we should have a clear indication of how quickly these restrictions can be removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para20"></a>So far as the sea fisheries are concerned (which are not strictly the subject of debate today) I should also like to say that the results for fin fish are encouraging. We are hoping that we shall be able to make some announcement on that but not, perhaps, at the same time as we lift the order for river fishing. But we are considering very carefully whether some variation can be made to the sea fishing order to exclude fishing for salmon and sea trout through the river mouth nets at the same time as the order we are debating this evening is lifted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-22_para21"></a>So far as compensation is concerned, that is a matter for the insurers and the international oil pollution fund. The basic principle is that any economic loss is covered. Anyone who has suffered economic loss as a result of this should be, if they so wished and if they consider their loss significantly sufficient, applying to the insurers and to the compensation fund for a recovery of damages. For those in the industries which might suffer slightly more longer-term damage, such as tourism, the effect on whose business might not be evident until the end of the summer season, they will have to wait until they know what the damage is until they can claim, unless they qualify as a hardship case, in which case the hardship fund is there to help them out immediately. With those words of comfort, I commend the order to the House.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

They will be rejoicing in the "Salutation Arms" at Nantgaredig this evening, particularly when they hear that anyone who suffered economic loss is likely to recover, West Wales being what it is. I am very grateful that the Minister has been able to be so candid on this occasion because it is an issue which affects so many people. I am most obliged.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 16, at end insert (", but no such order shall include India").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: I was very glad to hear from the Minister with regard to the last amendment that she and her department relied extensively on the evidence of Amnesty International because, as she will be aware, Amnesty International has recently published--I believe at the beginning of last month--a paper listing its long-standing concerns about the human rights situation in India. It lists torture, ill treatment of detainees and prisoners, and unfair trials of political prisoners. It says that the forces of law and order have used extrajudicial methods of exercising control, particularly in regions of internal armed conflict; that many people have disappeared after being taken into custody; that legal safeguards for detainees are ignored; and that judicial remedies are not available to the victims or their relatives. That is a point of particular importance, bearing in mind what the noble Baroness said on the earlier amendment; namely, that in deciding what countries to put on the list for designation particular regard would be paid to the availability of remedies for people who say that their human rights have been violated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para5"></a>Special laws continue to deprive the people of protection, despite the fact that the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (known as TADA) was allowed to lapse in May 1995. In Jammu and Kashmir, the Public Safety Act is used for preventive detention and many of the provisions of TADA have been incorporated into the ordinary law. I want particularly to refer to the situation in the Punjab and in Jammu and Kashmir.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para6"></a>I take first the Punjab where the situation is better than it was, but it is still not good. The impunity enjoyed by the security forces in respect of earlier disappearances and extrajudicial executions is still maintained. The Foreign Office pointed out to me that, according to press reports, in 1992 there were 4,000 deaths; in 1993 there were 394; in 1994 there were 50; and in 1995 there were only 4. But it is dangerous to believe everything that one reads in the press. Even though the trend is downward, it does not mean to say that being an activist in Sikh politics or in human rights is now a safe occupation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para7"></a>One particularly high profile case, of which I imagine the noble Baroness will be aware, is that of Mr. Jaswant Singh Khalra, a very well-known human rights activist, in which there are good grounds for thinking that he was extrajudicially murdered in custody. The Minister who deals with that area in the Foreign Office, Mr. Jeremy Hanley, tells me that our High Commission in New Delhi is monitoring the case closely and has raised it several times with the Indian Government. The Supreme Court of India decided last November to ask the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct an inquiry into Mr. Khalra's whereabouts and to report within three months. The deadline was then extended to the end of April and it is important that we should evaluate the <P>


<a name="column_1095"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1095</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>present state of affairs in Punjab in the light of the CBI's findings. If those responsible for Mr. Khalra's disappearance and probable murder are arrested, a signal will be given to people in the law enforcement agencies who commit crimes that they are no longer going to be above the law as they have been for so many years past. If, however, there is further procrastination, or worse still, the CBI has nothing to say about the case, it will be clear that the situation with regard to impunity is as bad as ever, so this would be the wrong moment to form any conclusions about whether there has been any general improvement in the authority's attitude to the rule of law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para8"></a>That case is not unique. I use it simply as an example. I give just one other example of the way that things work in Punjab. I refer to the case Harjit Singh, son of Kashmir Singh, who disappeared following his arrest on 29th April 1992. I use that case as an example to illustrate what happens if people complain to the courts. A three-year inquiry was followed by a report to the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Chandigarh on 29th November 1995, but no conclusions were reached by that court, partly because of the lack of co-operation by the authorities and deliberate obstruction in the form of harassment and intimidation of witnesses, and partly because the Sessions Court seems to have been dilatory in pursuing its inquiries. The state failed to produce any evidence to support its claim that Harjit Singh had been killed in an "encounter" on 11th May 1992, the usual routine explanation which is given for cases of disappearance in Punjab.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para9"></a>The Parliamentary Human Rights Group wrote to the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court on 22nd March, suggesting that it should conduct its own investigation which might reveal some interesting material about why the inquiries by the lower court had taken so long, but so far we have had no reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para10"></a>As to whether or not it is safe for Sikh activists to return to India, there are several known cases where deportees have suffered violations of their human rights. I refer to the case of Kuldeep Singh who, after being deported from Germany following the rejection of his application for political asylum, was arrested by the Delhi police, taken to his house and questioned, using third-degree methods to extract information from him about how he got to Germany. I refer next to the case of Devinder Singh Bhullar, known as "Deepak", a known Khalistani militant from Dayalpura village. He was picked up by the police in 1995 and deported from Germany. It was reported that after he had been returned, he was produced in court and charges were made against him, but nobody has been able to ascertain that because the proceedings were conducted in camera.

<A NAME = "60423-23_para11"></a>Mr. Pal Singh Kooner was subjected to abuses after returning to India on holiday. He was not deported. Nevertheless, his case illustrates the dangers to someone active in Sikh politics because it happened as recently at 12th January 1995. In short, it is not safe to return Sikh activists or human rights workers who are refused asylum in the United Kingdom.

<FONT SIZE=3>to Indian rule of the portion of the state they have occupied since 1947, that since the intifada began in January 1990, 42,160 people have been killed, 27,021 wounded and 35,836 disabled for life. There is abundant evidence of continuing extrajudicial executions, disappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, sexual abuse and collective punishment of villages and towns. As the US State Department says,

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para13"></a>The Government's perception of the situation in Kashmir is of return to relative order, as I think the noble Baroness said in an earlier intervention. I am not sure how closely she monitors the situation, but we are constantly drawing the attention of Ministers to events that have happened very recently which indicate a continuing pattern of abuse which is as bad as anything that has happened in the past. The Foreign Office knows, for example, about the killing of Mr. Jalil Andrabi which happened at the end of March. It knows about a case even more recent than that when armed police entered the precincts of the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, one of the holiest places in Kashmir, and after some altercation shot dead 11 members of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front who were in the precincts of the shrine. When the rest of them withdrew to the shrine itself, a bargain was reached by the intercession of one of the people who had been custodian of that place, that they were to withdraw from the shrine, and they were then to be given free movement by the Indian authorities. When they withdrew to a building nearby, the Indian authorities broke the bargain and stormed the building, killing 24 people and reducing the building to rubble.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-23_para14"></a>In summary, that is the situation in Kashmir at the moment. The noble Baroness when she comes to reply will have to say how you can reconcile a situation of gross human rights violations such as we have there with the placing of India on any list which accelerates the procedures for dealing with applicants for asylum from such countries. At this late hour I shall rest my case there, although I know that there are others who would like to say more on the question of Kashmir in particular. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60423-24_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   I wish to speak on the complexities of Kashmir. I accept that there is international concern. I visited the region, including refugee camps, on the Pakistan side of the ceasefire line. It might be of some assistance to offer to the Committee a quick overview which illustrates those complexities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para0"></a>This is arguably a three-sided dispute. India's perspective focuses on the bilateral nature of a dispute between India and Pakistan. India does not countenance foreign intervention, including from the United Nations. Its position is premised on legal, historical, political, strategic and secular arguments. India criticises Pakistan for assisting and encouraging terrorism and militancy, as well as for "internationalising" the issue. Its response to criticism of the military's record on human rights is to point to the improved openness and transparency.

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para1"></a>To Pakistan, Kashmir is unfinished business, an international dispute to be settled according to the relevant UN resolution, through a UN-supervised plebiscite to decide accession to either India or Pakistan.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para2"></a>To the Kashmiris, this is not simple a dispute between two sovereign nations, but a conflict among three parties. They insist on their right to self-determination, as described in a number of Security Council resolutions. Independence must be seen as a viable option to be weighed alongside accession to either India or Pakistan.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para3"></a>The positions of the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union are broadly similar. The United Kingdom maintains excellent relations with both India and Pakistan and both are members of the Commonwealth. Finally, I have spoken to both High Commissioners on the merits of the issue before us today. They wholeheartedly support the Government's position, as do I, and would so urge Members of your Lordships' Committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   Before we conclude the discussion on Amendment No. 8, I wish to make one or two brief points. First, I wish to pay tribute to the noble Baroness. Though there may be disagreement on many issues concerning this Bill and the matters around it, she shows a remarkable degree of patience and endurance. For that she deserves full praise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para4"></a>Secondly, the arguments adduced by my noble friend Lord Avebury indicate the difficulties of a white list. I fear that the Government will find that it attracts to the discussion of what should and should not be on the list of so-called designated countries, the knowledge--it is a detailed knowledge--of people like my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Waverley. It will therefore be an almost impossible line to hold. I hope therefore that the Minister will take back some thoughts to the department--of which she is a jewel--that indicate that the whole attempt to try to produce a designated list will be marked by all kinds of pitfalls and difficulties. She may well come to wish that the proposal had never been advanced because the knowledge from all sides of this Chamber is so very deep that she will find that the attempt to put almost any country on the list will be fraught with difficulty.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   First, there is to be another substantial debate regarding all of these matters if the amendments are not accepted by the Committee tonight. It is interesting that different people speak from different perspectives; some see it through the eyes of specific individual cases; others take the overview and understand the complexities of interrelationships between different parties both within that country and how that country relates to its neighbours and, indeed, how it relates to its more international friends in the United States and Britain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para5"></a>I want to continue to remind the Committee that we are talking about a country that has an increasing number of applicants to Britain, the majority of which do not qualify under the 1951 convention for asylum status. It is only that qualification, plus the criteria I read <P>


<a name="column_1098"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1098</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out earlier, that will be taken into account. But nothing inhibits or precludes proper consideration of every single case that comes before the Home Office for consideration under the asylum procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para6"></a>I made some comments in relation to India when responding to points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, earlier. Perhaps I may add to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para7"></a>The Indian economy is the sixth largest in the world according to IMF studies and based on purchasing power parity. However, it has a number of serious structural problems and India is one of the 20 poorest countries in the world. There are areas of great poverty and in agricultural areas such as the Punjab, the poor farmers have an economic motive in claiming asylum overseas. Our assessment is based on independent monitoring. In addition to reports from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we take account of the views of other western governments, independent press reporting and reports from organisations such as Amnesty International. I shall return to that in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para8"></a>Militant unrest in the Punjab, which was under direct rule from Delhi from 1987-1992, has now largely subsided. The Sikh campaign for greater autonomy continues to be an issue, but the restoration of relative calm has meant it has recently been possible again to hold elections in the state. Participation in elections has risen steadily since 1992 while violence has reduced significantly. There were over 4,000 deaths during 1992, but 394 in 1993. In 1994 under 50 people were reported killed. The economy of the Punjab, traditionally India's most prosperous state, is again flourishing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para9"></a>Amnesty International--specifically mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury--reports and the US Government State Department Human Rights reports allege that there continue to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitutional and statutory safeguards. Those include extrajudicial executions, torture and reprisal killings by security forces fighting separatist insurgents in Kashmir; extrajudicial executions by the police in the Punjab; torture, rape and deaths of suspects in police custody throughout India; and detention for prolonged periods without charges under special security legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para10"></a>However, the same US State Department report details action that has been taken by the Indian Government to counter this situation. A National Human Rights Commission was established in 1993 and that has been described in the report as an,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"effective advocate for human rights". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
One of its main priorities is torture and death in police custody and magistrates appear to be complying with the NHRC's directive to report all custodial deaths.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para11"></a>The State Department report also describes how the courts have been more active in prosecuting cases of custodial abuse, while the Supreme Court ordered the prosecution of a number of police officers accused of murder and fake encounter killings, and investigation of other cases of police abuse and negligence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para12"></a>The insurrection in the Kashmir valley is India's major internal problem. Violence continues between militants seeking secession from India--a point made by <P>


<a name="column_1099"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1099</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Waverley--and the Indian security forces. The heavy-handed response of the Indian security forces to Kashmiri militants further alienated Kashmiri Moslems and encouraged increased support for Kashmiri militants crossing over from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. An estimated 200,000 Hindus have fled the Valley since 1990, many of whom are now living in refugee camps. India continues to pursue a tough counter-insurgency policy. The Indian press report that over 10,000 people have been killed since the insurgency began.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para13"></a>The Indian Government announced their intention to hold elections in Kashmir in order to get a political process going in the state. Those are currently scheduled for May 1996, the same time as the Indian general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para14"></a>There has been international concern about the need to respect human rights; the importance of greater openness in bringing wrongdoers to justice; and of allowing investigations by international human rights organisations. The Indian Government have taken a number of steps to meet those concerns. The National Human Rights Commission set up in 1993 has shown an encouraging readiness to criticise the actions of the Indian authorities and the security forces. The Government also allowed greater access to Kashmir. A delegation of EU Ambassadors visited Kashmir in April 1995 and were given free access, including to detention centres. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visited in May 1995. The Government recently agreed to give the International Red Cross a long-term monitoring role in Kashmir. It is also the case that the victims of abuse tend to move to other parts of India which are safer for them and rarely seek entry to the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para15"></a>Various areas of India, particularly the state of Gujerat, have seen incidents of communal violence between Hindus (who form the majority of the Indian population) and Moslems (who form some 12 per cent. of the population). That came to a head following the demolition of the mosque at Ayodhya in December 1992 by fanatical Hindus. The police took strong measures to contain the riots which ensued. At least 550 people died and 2,500 were injured in those disturbances. The Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu party, was accused of fomenting the attack at Ayodhya and of seeking to exploit the disturbances which followed. The Indian Government responded by imposing President's Rule on states governed by the BJP, banning both Hindu and Moslem militant groups and arresting those who were actively involved in inciting communal violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para16"></a>India is a secular state--as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury--and freedom of religion is provided for in the constitution. Moslems, in common with other religious groups, live, work and worship without interference from the Government. Moslems hold prominent positions in both the public and private sectors. The Indian Union Moslem League holds two seats in the lower house of the Indian Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para17"></a>Obviously I cannot comment on individual cases which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has just brought to the Committee's attention. I accept that there have <P>


<a name="column_1100"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been incidents pertinent to this debate. On Kashmir, there has been international concern about the need to respect human rights, the importance of greater openness in bringing wrongdoers to justice, and of allowing investigations by international human rights organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para18"></a>The Indian government have taken a number of steps to meet those concerns. The National Human Rights Committee, set up in 1993, has shown an encouraging readiness to criticise the actions of the Indian authorities and security forces. For all of those reasons, and given that the people about whom we are now talking are not people who usually seek asylum--often they seek haven within the Indian continent without coming here--the truth is that those who have been seeking asylum have not qualified in the main under the United Nations Convention. Their cases have been fully considered, with all the rights of appeal, and the individual cases will continue to be fully considered on their merits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-24_para19"></a>For all those reasons, I invite the Committee to consider designation, which creates just a presumption, but which does not deny individuals the right to be considered properly and substantively, and also does not deny the right of appeal.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-25.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   One fully understands the enormous difficulties in a country the size and variety of India, but if the countries and the circumstances that the noble Baroness has just described qualify for the white list, what on earth do we have to do to be black?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   First of all, I have not conceded black and white. I do not use those terms. It is the noble Baroness and her colleagues who have been using those terms throughout the course of the day.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para0"></a>I have given both the criteria for consideration to enter--not the white list, as the noble Baroness calls it, but the designated list--and said that that would be a matter for both Houses to consider. I have also given the statistics for these particular seven countries, where there are many and growing numbers of applications, most of which do not qualify under the United Nations Convention of 1951. It is for those reasons that the countries are designated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para1"></a>That still does not deny full and proper consideration of an application. All that happens is that, following a substantive consideration, it is determined whether the certificate should be given or not. The presumption is in favour of the certificate, but if the particular circumstances of an applicant are such that the applicant qualifies, that applicant will be given asylum.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for the trouble she has taken in putting together a considerable weight of evidence to form her reply, even though she has been rather selective in her choice of material. It is on the basis of that selectivity that decisions are made whether to include countries such as India on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para2"></a>I have not used the term to which the Minister takes objection during the whole of these proceedings. It is a coinage of the newspapers and not something that any noble Lord invented for the purposes of this debate.
<P>


<a name="column_1101"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para3"></a>Whatever you call the list, to get a country onto it you examine facts and circumstances of the kind we have been discussing in relation to India, and you build up a picture from the individual case to the general. When I cite individual cases it is not because they are the only ones known to me. I could keep the Committee here a great deal longer if I were to relate all the individual cases that have been drawn to the attention of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group. In deference to the feelings of the Committee I shall not do that. It is sufficient merely to draw attention to some examples of a situation which is all-pervasive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para4"></a>When the Minister says that these things are being addressed by the Indian authorities and that the National Human Rights Commission is doing a wonderful job, I wonder whether she knows that the legislation which set up the National Human Rights Commission specifically barred it from investigating any allegations of human rights abuses in Kashmir. I do not see the Minister assenting or denying that proposition, but it is a fact. If she goes back to the parent legislation, she will find that the National Human Rights Commission is forbidden to look at anything that happens in Kashmir. Extra-statutorily, it has done so in one particular case only where the Government invited it to look at a massacre which occurred in a town called Bijbehara where something like 50 peaceful demonstrators were killed by the Indian armed forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para5"></a>That massacre has already been investigated by Justice Bahauddin Farooqi, who took evidence from a great number of villagers who were eyewitnesses to the tragedy. The National Human Rights Commission relied entirely on information supplied to it by the government and the authority of the state. It more or less repeated the conclusions of Justice Bahauddin Farooqi that these people had been extra-judicially killed. But that was the only incident of which I know where the Human Rights Commission has intervened to examine a case of human rights violations in the state of Jammu in Kashmir.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para6"></a>The Minister said also that there is greater access to Kashmir by outside organisations, and she quotes specifically the European Union ambassadors and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. But if she looks at the reports of the individual rapporteurs from the UN Human Rights Commission, and of the working groups which report to the Commission, she will find that none of them has been allowed entry. The report of January 15th 1996 of the working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the view of the Government of India that the suggestion of the working group regarding a visit to India is deemed inappropriate and unnecessary." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para7"></a>The special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, in his report of 25th January 1996, expresses his dismay at allegations of deaths under torture and the lethal force used by security forces in their efforts to curb the separatist movement in Jammu and Kashmir. Due to the systematic allegations of violations of the right of life in India, the special rapporteur would like to reiterate his <P>


<a name="column_1102"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest in visiting India. He is concerned that no substantial progress has been made since 1993 regarding his proposed visit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para8"></a>The special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, Dr. Nigel Rodley--a citizen of the United Kingdom, by the way--devotes no fewer than 122 paragraphs of his report of 16th January 1996 to India, just displacing Turkey, which has 94 paragraphs, from the head of the league table. A great deal of the material in Dr. Rodley's section on India relates to Kashmir. In the parent report of 9th January 1996, he concludes by saying that he continues to believe that the situation remains such that a visit to the country would be desirable and he regrets that the Government have not yet deemed it appropriate or opportune to invite him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para9"></a>So there we are. The noble Baroness can quote the EU ambassadors and high commissioners, but these are the people whose job it is to investigate particular violations of human rights on behalf of the UN Human Rights Commission. Amnesty International has still not been allowed to visit Jammu and Kashmir and neither has the Parliamentary Human Rights Group of which I have the honour to be chairman.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para10"></a>The noble Baroness says that holding elections in Jammu and Kashmir is a step forward. I can assure the noble Baroness that that is not how it is seen by the people of Kashmir. They believe that it is entirely wrong to attempt to hold elections in circumstances where there is a curfew which begins at five o'clock in the afternoon, half a million troops are pinning the inhabitants down in their houses, no freedom of assembly or expression exists and the electoral register is six years old. How can one expect to have a proper and fair election under such circumstances?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para11"></a>I appeal to the noble Baroness not to place such reliance on elections as has been evident from the three speeches she has made on Bulgaria, Ghana and India, as though they were a panacea and that once one had people in the voting booths that would solve all the human rights problems that existed prior to that date. I can assure the noble Baroness that, because of the vehement opposition of all the parties in conference to a process of elections which does not allow them to express their opinion on the one issue which is of great importance to them, namely, the constitutional status of the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, they will not allow elections to be held. If the Indians insist on going ahead with elections the turn-out will be 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. So, please, do not let us get the impression that having an election in May is going to solve the problem or make it go away. It will simply exacerbate it by antagonising and raising the hostility of people still further to the continuation of Indian rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para12"></a>I know that there is no point in putting this matter to a Division at this late hour. However, I hope that some of what has been placed on the record this evening will help the Committee to decide that it is wrong in principle when the time comes for us to vote on an order which the Secretary of State will place before us calling for this and other states, which have no reason for being on it, to be placed on a list which makes their inhabitants <P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para13"></a>Amendment No. 8, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, by leave, withdrawn.

Line 16, at end insert (", but no such order shall include Pakistan").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: As it is getting on, I shall not hold the Committee up at great length on the question of Pakistan, but I must reiterate a couple of the points which have already been made. There is the question of extrajudicial killings in the city of Karachi and in Sind, generally, which, as the noble Baroness is aware, is a subject of anxiety to the US State Department, Amnesty International and to many other human rights authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para15"></a>Here again, the rapporteurs could play a useful role in reducing the level of violence. Every day we get reports from Karachi of killings by the security forces, and by the police and the rangers. I have no doubt that there are also killings by the MQM, which is the main organisation responsible for the Mohajirs--that is to say, the people who came into Pakistan at the time of Partition when they had to flee from India, but who still largely consider themselves to be a separate people. Because they have organised themselves into a political party which seeks a degree of separation from the state, there is a continuing political difficulty which has turned into a violent confrontation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para16"></a>Both sides say that they want to end it by coming to the conference table and deciding how the constitutional future of the Sind province and of Karachi itself shall be determined. In the meantime, every single day people are being murdered on the streets and are disappearing. In those circumstances, if refugees from Karachi came to this country it would be difficult for us to claim that the general situation in that area and the province as a whole was not such as to cause a general refugee problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para17"></a>The question of the Ahmadis has also been mentioned. In the past few years I have had a great deal to do with the Ahmadis. I have had a good deal of discussion with them as to the infamous Ordinance 20 which was introduced under General Zia's regime. That penalises the Ahmadis so that in religious matters they cannot express themselves in the way that they wish. They cannot say that they are Moslems, use the call to prayer, display sentences from the Koran on their mosques and congregate to pray in the way that they wish. The upholding of this legislation by the Supreme Court last year has placed the whole of the Ahmadi community at a severe disadvantage. The effect of the legislation is to cause hostility on the part of the public as a whole toward the Ahmadi community. The problem is not simply the existence of Ordinance 20 and the legal action taken against Ahmadis in the courts. Serious though that is--it is in contravention of internationally accepted norms as to freedom of religion--the effect of the legislation on the minds of ordinary people is to incite them to think of the Ahmadis as being in some <P>


<a name="column_1104"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way unacceptable to Moslems as a whole and to the Pakistani state. Many Ahmadis are murdered. The murders are not properly investigated. A good many Ahmadis have had to flee into exile, as the noble Baroness will be aware.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para18"></a>Notwithstanding the fact that the rule of law generally prevails in Pakistan and that it has a democratically elected government--I concede this point to the noble Baroness--I believe that the situation in that country is somewhat different. There have been changes of government from one party to another. I believe that, on the whole, the democratic system works far better than in other countries that we see on the list. However, the fact that there are democratic elections is no guarantee that human rights will be observed. In the case of Pakistan in particular, I do not believe that it qualifies for inclusion in a list of this kind. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I deal specifically with Pakistan. Christians enjoy religious freedom under the law, and the majority of Christians continue to practise their religion openly. The Ahmadis--a minority Moslem sect--are subject to discriminatory religious legislation, but convictions remain rare. Some harassment of both Christians and Ahmadis occurs, but it is not systematic or government-led. Asylum claims from these groups will continue to be considered carefully and on their merits, but it should not be assumed that all are automatically well founded. The great majority of applications from Pakistan are not by Christians or indeed Ahmadis.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para19"></a>Pakistan is a poor country with great extremes in the distribution of wealth. The biggest sector of the colony is agriculture. Prosperity in most sectors is confined to a few family cartels, while unemployment grows among ordinary people. Although the framework of Pakistan's legal system is based on the constitution, it inherited many aspects of English common law filtered through British Indian law. The framework unites with elements of Islamic law to produce federal and provincial statutes. According to the Constitution of Pakistan, the judiciary enjoys almost complete independence from the executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para20"></a>Although Pakistan declared itself an Islamic republic in 1956, successive governments have guaranteed the civil rights of religious minorities. There is no systematic or government-led persecution of religious minorities, but discrimination and harassment exist. There are two main religious minorities which apply for asylum in the United Kingdom: Christians and Ahmadis. As I have said the Ahmadis are a minority Moslem sect, and are classified as non-Moslem under Pakistan law. There is no systematic or government-led persecution of Christians in Pakistan.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para21"></a>The constitution guarantees the civil rights of religious minorities, and Islamic law supports the constitutional position. Nevertheless, in parts of Pakistan Ahmadis face a problem. Most of Pakistan is peaceful, but there has been violence in Karachi and to a lesser extent in Hyderabad. The main reason for the violence is the confrontation between the MQM and the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>government, but ethnic and sectarian violence is also a feature. Shia and Sunni sectarian violence has occurred mainly in urban areas of the Punjab such as Jang, Faisalabad and Lahore. On occasions there has also been sectarian violence between Moslems, Ahmadis and Christians.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para22"></a>In terms of political rights and freedom in Pakistan, membership of political parties is widespread, and ordinary Pakistanis are neither discouraged from joining the party of their choice, nor are they harassed for their political opinion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para23"></a>As a democracy there is freedom of opinion and assembly. Pakistan has a thriving newspaper industry with hundreds of titles, the vast majority of which are privately owned. In December 1985 freedom of the press was restored in principle when martial law was repealed and the constitution restored. In 1990 the press was further liberalised, and is now generally free to discuss public issues. The Government retain the power of confiscation for a wide range of prohibitions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para24"></a>The case is that a small number of Christians suffer intimidation, vandalism and harassment by their non-Christian neighbours, or by misapplication of, or false accusations under, the blasphemy laws. The majority of Christians in Pakistan are, generally speaking, able to practise their religion openly. The stringency of the blasphemy laws has increased progressively since 1980 and may raise issues in exceptional cases and those are the ones that would be dealt with sympathetically and they are consistent with the United Nations Convention. Ahmadis are recognised as a minority religious group and their rights are safeguarded under the constitution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para25"></a>Women in Pakistan: Pakistan's current constitution recognises the equality of men and women before the law, prohibits sexual discrimination within the civil service, and grants women the right to participate fully in all activities in the national arena. In 1979--I think the noble Lord is aware of this--Hudood Ordinances subordinated women's status to that of men. They brought together laws relating to theft, prohibition of alcohol and narcotics, "Zina" (rape, abduction, adultery and fornication), and "Qazf" (false accusation of Zina). In 1992 it was estimated that 2,000 women were held in prison under those ordinances. A further estimate concluded that 85 per cent. of women in police custody were sexually assaulted in detention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para26"></a>However, in October 1992 the Sharif government approved an amendment to the code of criminal procedure that women should not be detained in police stations overnight and that they should only be interrogated in the presence of a close male relative. This amendment has yet to be passed by the National Assembly. Some organisations which aim to improve the status of women in Pakistan have emerged; various local groups offer legal and medical advice and assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-25_para27"></a>In January 1994, Benazir Bhutto established the first police station for women, administered exclusively by women. It remains to be seen whether further measures to improve the situation of women in Pakistan will follow.

<A NAME="60423-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I do not wish to prolong the Committee stage. I wish only at this stage to make one remark for the Minister to bear in mind. It seems to me that the very helpful descriptions that she has given us of the countries mentioned by my noble friend do, if anything, deepen one's worry about the designated list. I apologise for using the phrase, "the white list"; the Minister was absolutely right to pull me up. It is a phrase that has been used in journalism and it is not a phrase which ought to be used. I apologise for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para0"></a>The designated list, by the Minister's own submission, includes countries which have, in certain respects, troubling aspects in their handling of their citizens. What she has just said about the way in which the Pakistani police have dealt with some women detainees, in particular, does indeed deepen my own worries about the designated list. I should like her to consider very carefully before we come to the Report stage whether those names should be on that list.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If we are reaching the end of this series of debates about individual countries, I should like to add a few words to what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has just said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para1"></a>I have listened attentively particularly to the Government replies. What struck me about them is the care which the Minister has taken not only to give the official viewpoint about human rights abuses--I am sure that she has been fair on the evidence available to her--but she has also gone out of her way to talk about the poverty in those areas and to answer in advance the arguments which might be made, but have not been made, about economic refugees from those countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para2"></a>If one starts by saying that a designated list which is justified because the poverty in those countries is going to push people out of those countries as economic refugees, then the list will be very extensive indeed. If we must accept the idea of a designated list, which I do not wish to do, I hope that we shall not feel that it is justified to include countries on that list because they are so poor that they will be an impetus for economic refugees who would not fall within the category of asylum seekers. That would seem to me to be extremely dangerous indeed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This has been an important, useful and informative debate. We shall clearly all reflect on what has been said. But at the end of the day, we are talking about an asylum Bill and having a fair but firm process and a genuine consideration of those people who come to this country seeking asylum.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para3"></a>We are bound by our European convention and United Nations obligations. But our starting point for a designated list is to select those countries from which we have the greatest number of applications and the <P>


<a name="column_1107"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>highest number of refusals. That may be because there are economic migrants but there will be other reasons too. That is the starting point. I have given one example of a country where those criteria are met but about which we still take a view that the general level of human rights in the country is not acceptable, and for that reason the country is not on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para4"></a>Having said that, we then go on to consider such factors as the stability of the country, the state's adherence to national and human rights instruments, democratic institutions, elections and political pluralism. I note what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said about elections. He dismissed them as not being important. In fact, I believe that he said that it would be better not to have them. Elections are a first step. The noble Lord criticised me for saying that but they are a first step.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I did not say anything of the kind to the Minister. I said that elections are not a guarantee of human rights observations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   We shall both read Hansard tomorrow, but the noble Lord did indeed make that point. I have never said nor have I claimed at the Dispatch Box that elections are a guarantee of anything. But they are a first step in the democratic process. The prediction was that only 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. would turn out if there were elections. However small is the turnout, it is a beginning and it is a first step. The opportunity to give people a voice is extremely important, however imperfect the system may be.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para5"></a>Elections and political pluralism are factors which are considered. Freedom of expression by individuals is considered, as is the extent to which there is a free press and the availability and effectiveness of legal avenues of protection and redress.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para6"></a>I end by making the point that if somebody arrives here with a well-founded fear of persecution which can be proven, irrespective of the kind of country from which he comes, his case will be given full consideration. It is only after such consideration that a determination is made as to whether or not there should be a certificate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Perhaps I may say a few words in defence of my noble friend. I did not hear my noble friend say one word which could in any way be taken to denigrate elections. If he had said that, I am sure that there would have been protests from many parts of the Committee, including from these Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para7"></a>My noble friend and other Members of the Committee attach the greatest importance to elections which are an essential guarantee of legitimacy. We use the same argument that was put by John Stuart Mill: however essential they are, by themselves they are not a sufficient guarantee of liberty because the people may desire to oppress a part of their number.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para8"></a>What one needs for a free country are both elections and a properly arranged rule of law. The praise of either of those things as necessary is not in any way meant to imply a denigration of the other. I hope that is now clear to every quarter of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I wish to clear up my views on elections and the misunderstanding which I think the noble Baroness may have arrived at because of something I said in relation to Jammu and Kashmir. The point there is that most of the people want either to become independent or to accede to Pakistan instead of being, as they are at present, under the rule of India. I do not wish to discuss the history of the matter, but the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir was a Hindu who took a majority Moslem state into the Indian Union in 1947. That is the cause of these difficulties because there is still a majority of Moslems in the Indian held part of Jammu and Kashmir who feel that they do not belong in the Indian polity and who would like another constitutional solution. In that particular case, if elections are held under the Indian constitution, under which every candidate has to take an oath of loyalty to the Indian state and no person may argue that different constitutional solutions for the territory are better than the one they have now, that is a bogus procedure. It is not a free and fair election which gives the people the opportunity of saying what kind of democratic system they would like to have.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para9"></a>Perhaps the noble Baroness will say to her friend, Mr. Narasimha Rao the Prime Minister of India, that this Government believe that a free and fair election--as in this country--is one that gives people total choice as regards the constitutional system that they want. If some people in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales wish to separate from the United Kingdom, it is permissible for them to form political parties to advocate that from an election platform and to publish newspapers that advocate those solutions. If that is the kind of process that the Government wish to see in Jammu and Kashmir, of course I shall support them wholeheartedly. However, when I have tried to put this point to Foreign Office Ministers--I have put it to Mr. Lennox-Boyd in the past, and now to Mr. Hanley--they refuse to be drawn on what they consider to be a free and fair election, and on what I consider to be a bogus procedure which does not give people any opportunity to express their views on the most important question that faces them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I am rather puzzled. The noble Lord quite rightly criticised me for opening up a panoramic debate. We have dealt at some length with the problems of minorities in Pakistan and in Bulgaria. What we are concerned about in this debate is individuals. I am quite prepared to enter a panoramic debate with the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Lord opposite as I have the same interest in history. However, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has referred to the problems of minorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-26_para10"></a>I return to what I said earlier--for which the noble Lord criticised me--when I say that the debate concerning individuals is being lost in the problems of minorities. I suggest what I have suggested before; namely, that if anything terrible occurs to these minorities--let me take the example of Bulgaria, but Kashmir would be as worthy an example--we shall not be dealing with one or two people but with thousands. <P>


<a name="column_1109"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This debate has concentrated on a universal human problem of minorities. We are dealing with individuals. We are losing the point. Our fox has gone to earth.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   If the noble Lord will forgive me, we are not dealing with minorities. We are dealing with elections. I sought to respond to the statement by the noble Baroness that I had said that I did not think elections were useful in solving human rights violations. In the specific case of Jammu and Kashmir, I sought to indicate why elections were an inappropriate response to the situation that those people face. In general, of course, we believe that elections are an important component of human rights. All I say to the noble Baroness is that one should not consider elections as a panacea.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope that I may be forgiven for this intervention. We are on Amendment No. 9. We have now spent a quarter of the time apportioned to the Bill. I believe that the noble Lord has made his point well; I believe that the House has taken that point; and it is on the record. I wonder whether we could progress a little. I believe that we have about 25 minutes left for the business.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I was distracted by the intervention. I had been coming to the end of my remarks. I was about to say to the noble Baroness, as my noble friend has already done, how much I appreciate the immense trouble that she has taken to give full responses to the four amendments tabled on individual countries. I believe that the debate will turn out to be useful, not entirely for what the noble Baroness said, but for what she omitted to say. The debate illustrates the necessity for careful examination of the statements which have been promised by the Secretary of State in order to indicate the political and human rights conditions in each of the countries which it is proposed to place on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para0"></a>In conclusion, I ask the noble Baroness whether it is possible for drafts of those papers to be presented to noble Lords prior to the debate. If we have any suggestions on how they should be amended, or how better to portray the human rights and political conditions in the countries concerned, perhaps we may submit our proposals. We did so as regards the Home Office's document on Nigeria, as the noble Baroness may remember. Many of those points were taken up. As I believe that we may claim to have slightly greater experience than the Home Office as regards what is happening in other countries, perhaps we could make a useful contribution towards the compilation of those papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para1"></a>However, the essence of the four debates has led me to the conclusion--I do not know about other noble Lords--that we have amply illustrated the fact that it is wrong to distinguish certain countries which are to be taken out of the mainstream and dealt with by another procedure within our asylum system. I believe that enough criticisms have been made of the human rights systems in each of those four countries--there are another three that we have not discussed--to indicate <P>


<a name="column_1110"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the procedure is wrong in principle. We believe that such orders from the Secretary of State should be rejected and that no country should be singled out for the fast-track procedure. Having said that, I accede to the noble Baroness's suggestion and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para2"></a>Amendment No. 9, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 9A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 16, at end insert ("and where the country concerned has indicated in writing its willingness to take the applicant.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I can move the amendment briefly. I shall speak more briefly than did my noble friend in moving the previous four amendments. However, it is important to recognise that there is a great tradition in British history, the tradition of the man or woman of conscience from John Bunyan onwards. My noble friend marvellously exemplifies the doggedness and determination of those men and women of conscience. They do not worry that everyone else wants coffee or to go to bed; they stick at it because they believe that the principle is right. I pay due tribute to my noble friend who has kept us debating for the past hour and a half.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para4"></a>Amendment No. 9A is a probing amendment. It is not addressed to those people who are returned to the countries on the designated list from which they come. We have discussed that situation in great detail; I do not wish to go over that ground again.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para5"></a>The amendment deals with the issue of people who are sent back to a friendly country, sometimes known as a third country. I am concerned with people on the designated list who may be returned to a third country rather than the country from which they originally came. I seek a written understanding of some kind in order to avoid the fairly cynical business of "pass-the-parcel". That has become, alas, a characteristic of the way in which we treat human beings in the world today. In other words, if you can land the refugees somewhere else, that is good enough, and you can wash your hands of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para6"></a>The amendment's purpose is to find out how far the Government will try to seek assurances from any country back to which they send someone, or to a third country to which they may have travelled on their way here. Do we try to discover whether such people will be accepted by that country?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para7"></a>I am sure that, like me, noble Lords have read of cases where refugees are shuffled from country to country. They are taken to airports, put on planes and sent back again and again. That is a disturbing characteristic of the modern world. I do not refer just to the United Kingdom but to all the countries of the European Union. One finds people being sent to and fro. Perhaps I may give one example of Zairean refugees who have been returned to Belgium. In most respects, Belgium is a democracy, a friendly country and a member of the European Union, but it has a disturbing tendency to send Zairean refugees back to Zaire, one of the most brutal dictatorships that the world knows. I know because <P>


<a name="column_1111"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I once had the non-pleasure of chairing a meeting with President Mobutu who is by any standards a violent and brutal dictator.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para8"></a>I wish to ensure that we know that we are not returning asylum seekers, on the ground that they have a friendly country to which to return, to countries which might send them back to the country from which they started, and which could not be described as friendly. I believe that that is called refoulement. I wish to discover whether we have taken steps to ensure that refoulement will not occur when we return someone to such a country. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-27_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   This is an amendment of some importance. The UNHCR has observed that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It must be recognised that the notion that an asylum seeker ought to seek protection at the first available opportunity is not a principle of international law but rather a practice that some states have employed to limit the numbers of asylum seekers claiming refugee status in their own countries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We are concerned here not about whether the country in question is law abiding and in general safe but whether the specific refugee is able to obtain access to the asylum process. I intend to refer to a number of cases in a moment, but before doing so I wish to put to the Minister a hypothetical case in which we are the third country. I shall be interested in her answer which will guide some of my behaviour in the course of later proceedings on the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para9"></a>Let us assume that there is a person with a well-founded fear of persecution in Chad. He wishes, being French-speaking, to claim asylum in France. Getting a flight out of Chad without being noticed is difficult as such flights are thin on the ground. So he escapes overland through Nigeria. He catches a plane from Lagos but can only find one to London and not Paris. Arriving in London he manages to make his way through to France which sends him back here under the third country rule. What do we do with that applicant? If we admit him to the process and allow him to claim asylum here, well and good. He will end up in a country where he does not speak the language rather than in one where he does, but his life and liberty will not be in danger, so perhaps no desperate harm is done. However, can the noble Baroness assure me that we will neither bounce him back to Paris which will set up a game of battledore and shuttlecock nor return him to Lagos?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para10"></a>The question of obtaining access to the process is crucial. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the judgment of Mr. Justice Hidden last week in the case of ex parte Bostam. It concerned the status of Belgium as a safe third country. The court was much influenced, in finding Belgium not to be a safe third country for those particular applicants, by the case of Kwita, decided by the Conseil d'Etat in March 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para11"></a>Belgium has what is known as the eight-day rule. That means that a person must claim asylum within eight days of arriving in Belgium. But of course in the case of people who have been in transit through Belgium before claiming asylum elsewhere, the question arises as to whether the eight days run from the first arrival in Belgium, or from the second. The Belgian Ministry of the Interior takes one interpretation; the Belgian Border Police takes the other.
<P>


<a name="column_1112"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para12"></a>In the case of Kwita, who had been 12 days in Belgium and then claimed asylum in the UK and was sent back to Belgium under the safe third country rule, he was refused the right to claim asylum and sent back. That was the ground on which Mr. Justice Hidden decided that Belgium was not a safe third country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para13"></a>We can find similar cases in most other countries of the European Union where the person was found not to be an asylum seeker because he could not get admission to the process. There is a case from the Netherlands, where the Dutch insisted that the woman was only in transit in Holland and readmittance was out of the question. The Home Office adjudicator said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whether in fact the appellant was only in transit may be doubtful, but this is the view taken by the Dutch authorities on the evidence available to them. In the light of this latter, I cannot be satisfied that the applicant will be readmitted to Holland, nor that a claim for asylum would be considered by the Dutch authorities". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para14"></a>There are a number of other similar cases in the Netherlands, some of which were found to be proved by the Dutch ombudsman. It is one of the delights in dealing with what is in general a free country that authorities within the country itself may investigate these matters and find the complaints to be justified. However, no country is so free that it does not have technical restrictions on its asylum process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para15"></a>I wonder, incidentally, if we rely heavily on the safe third country rule, whether because a great many planes land in London on the way to destinations in Continental Europe, we may get more people sent back to us than we send back to anywhere else. I wonder whether this process will be for the convenience of anybody at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-27_para16"></a>If there is to be a safe third country procedure, it should be operated only by international agreement. That is the only tidy way to do it. That is what my noble friend's amendment asks. I am delighted to support it.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am in difficulty now, since neither the noble Baroness nor the noble Earl actually addressed the amendment on the paper before us. They talked about Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 on a similar subject. It would have been better to have had all these amendments grouped so that we could talk about returning people either to countries of origin, or indeed to third countries, and the arrangements being made for that. I shall therefore deal with the amendment before the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para0"></a>This amendment would make the certification procedure in designated country cases unworkable. In such cases, it would require us to consult with the authorities in the applicant's country of origin and obtain from it an undertaking that it would take the applicant back. That would have to take place before we could issue a designated country certificate. Third countries are a matter for another part of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para1"></a>That is undesirable for a number of reasons. First, we have always taken the view that a country is responsible for its own nationals. The effectiveness of our control would be damaged if that principle were undermined. If we have considered a Ghanaian's asylum application and found that he is not a refugee, and that assessment has subsequently been confirmed by an adjudicator, removal would not put the failed applicant at risk. There <P>


<a name="column_1113"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is no reason why the process should involve a requirement to obtain the agreement of the Ghanaian authorities before removing a Ghanaian to his own country. There is also the whole issue of confidentiality in relation to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para2"></a>Secondly, designation involves a general assessment about whether there is a serious risk of persecution in a particular country. In designated country cases we shall still consider the substance of the asylum claim, and if the applicant is found to be a refugee then the issue of a certificate will not arise. But if the applicant has not demonstrated that the individual circumstances of his case merit the granting of asylum, then it will be appropriate to consider certifying his claim and applying the accelerated appeal procedure. The question of whether the authorities of the applicant's country of origin would give a written undertaking to take the applicant in question back is an entirely separate issue, distinct from both the merits of the asylum claim and the safety of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para3"></a>Thirdly, the amendment removes one of the key benefits of certification. In cases where a designated country certificate is issued, an accelerated appeal procedure will apply. It simply does not make sense to introduce a requirement which would delay refusal of the asylum claim and the issue of the certificate. There is no reason why a case would be prevented from entering the accelerated procedure in the absence of such an undertaking.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-28_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Baroness is attempting to argue that the procedure would be unworkable if we had to get the agreement of another country before returning anyone to them. I thought I put forward evidence to suggest that it was unworkable if we did not get such agreement. If we are both right, the conclusion is obvious: the procedure is unworkable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   We are talking about two different parts of the Bill. We are talking about somebody who comes from a country, applies for asylum, has a substantive claim considered and, at the end of the day, is both refused at the substantive stage and fails on appeal, and returns to the country of origin. First, there is the point of confidentiality. To contact the country and say, "one of your population has applied for asylum and we are now returning them" would breach a confidentiality. Secondly, they come from that country; they have the documentation for that country, and therefore returning to their own country is not the issue that has been both spoken to by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, who talked, and gave examples of, people moving through one country to another and being returned to a third country. That is dealt with in another part of the Bill. This part of the Bill deals with country of origin and a failed application.

<A NAME="60423-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   I apologise to the noble Baroness if the drafting of the amendment is poor. As I tried to indicate to her, the purpose was not to concern oneself with the return to the country of origin of a person seeking asylum. I was concerned about the possibility that we might miss a situation in which <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>somebody from a country on a designated list was returned to a third friendly country because they had travelled through such a country without ascertaining that they could stay and enter the process, as my noble friend said, in that country. With respect, I found it very difficult to put down an amendment under Clause 2 or Clause 3 which would actually reach the case of people who came from a designated list country. Hence I apologise to her, especially at this late moment, if I have got the drafting wrong. I perceive that she anticipated my amendment was directed towards a somewhat different purpose. I hope she will accept that the amendment was directed towards an important principle. I apologise if it is in another part of the Bill; but I could not see how to capture, if I may say so, people who came from a designated list through a third country or were returned to a third country except under Clause 1 of the Bill. If the drafting is wrong, I hope at least she will accept the purpose of the probing amendment and will at some stage give us some assurances on the matter, though I appreciate what she said about the drafting being wrong. I shall withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60423-28_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  I should point out to the Committee that if Amendment No. 10 is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 11 to 13 inclusive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>   moved, as amendment to Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Leave out lines 17 to 23.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 10 and 13 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para6"></a>If anyone is living in a country where there is a gross abuse of human rights, it is extremely difficult for that individual to apply to the government who is persecuting him or her in order to get a passport to leave. Therefore, people in such circumstances do what any of your Lordships would do, they get hold of a forged passport in order to leave the country. Similarly, if the individual happens to have a passport already, and requires a visa to move to a country of safety, then because it is extremely difficult to wait for the period of time it takes a country to issue a visa, the normal and sensible thing to do--which anyone would do--is to obtain a forged visa in the passport. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the 1951 convention recognise that asylum seekers may have difficulty in obtaining the appropriate documentation and visas. Article 31 of the Geneva Convention specifically provides that asylum seekers who enter a country illegally should not be penalised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para7"></a>But there is a further difficulty facing asylum seekers. It is not in fact possible through the normal processes, even if one could hang about waiting for a visa, to apply for a visa in order to become a refugee. There are some exceptions, such as the British Government's scheme which took a number of Bosnians from Serb detention camps. They were given entry clearance in Zagreb and came here properly documented, not as refugees but certainly with limited leave to remain. Other people who arrive with the proper permits as refugees are the <P>


<a name="column_1115"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Vietnamese who come under the special scheme from Hong Kong--the Vietnamese boat people. They arrive as refugees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para8"></a>For the rest, I contend that it is virtually impossible to obtain a visa as a refugee for any country in the world. So what do people do? If they are able to go through the process of applying for a visa, they need a visa to visit Britain or another country as either students or visitors. Visas are granted for those purposes. That might be the only way in which a non-forged visa can be obtained by someone seeking to escape from a country where he is suffering persecution and reach a country of safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para9"></a>It is a Catch 22 situation. If those people apply for a visa, they apply on the basis that they will be students or visitors--or perhaps they come for business reasons. Clearly, that does not represent the purpose of their visit so they are caught in that way. British immigration or the immigration authorities of other western countries can say that deception has been practised in the process of obtaining a visa. So such individuals are in genuine difficulties. They may have to obtain forged documents or forged visas; or, if they apply for visas, they cannot apply for the reasons for which they want to apply, namely, to seek safety in a western country. That is very difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para10"></a>Therefore, it is almost inevitable that in that process an asylum seeker may have to tell lies in order to get the documentation. The lies are either because the documents are forged or because untruths have to be told in order to obtain the visa to get from their country into a western country such as Britain. So the path to becoming an asylum seeker in a western country is an extremely difficult one. Indeed, there is no proper process through which it can happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para11"></a>It is not surprising that when asylum seekers happen to arrive at a point of entry to this country, say, at an airport or perhaps Dover, they may well be fearful about admitting what they have had to do to get here. They may be traumatised by their experiences in the country in which they were being persecuted. They may feel very uncomfortable about their documents and fearful that the British authorities at the point of entry might treat them badly and send them back immediately.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para12"></a>So people do what in the same circumstances I believe that we would all do. They seek to enter the country and find out from other people--perhaps people who have escaped from the same country from which they have escaped--how the situation is in this country and how best they can put in their claim as asylum seekers. So that is the way it happens in most cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para13"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to give people who come here in the circumstances that I have described at least the opportunity of not being fast-tracked in the procedures under the Bill or under the 1993 Act. I do that because I am afraid I still believe, despite the Minister's protestations this afternoon, that being fast-tracked puts the asylum applicant at a disadvantage compared with people who are not fast-tracked. There has to be some reason for fast-tracking people; it cannot be that the situation is different but the same. I believe that there are <P>


<a name="column_1116"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disadvantages in terms of the way in which the individual who is fast-tracked has his or her asylum claim considered. I have to believe that because I cannot understand why the Government are going through the problems of having parts of this Bill, with all the arguments that are taking place, unless there is something at the end of it that the Government want to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para14"></a>I contend, therefore, that these amendments would lessen the disadvantage facing asylum seekers who happened to come with documents which were not genuine, or who had made a false claim in the process of getting their visas. I suggest a very simple provision. It is supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is provided for in the 1951 convention. I would argue that the two amendments simply make the situation a little less difficult for those asylum seekers who have had to use such devices to find safety in this country in their escape from danger. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-28_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   It may save the time of the Committee if I speak now to Amendment No. 11. Perhaps my noble friend Lady Williams can speak to her Amendment No. 12 also. That would save us having several replies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para15"></a>What the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has said about deception is extremely important, and I agree with every word of it. It is part of the culture of being a refugee. It is recognised as such in the UN convention under Article 31. It was, I believe, recognised by the noble Baroness in her helpful general reply on Second Reading. I am unable to lay my hands on that at the moment, but if my recollection agrees with that of the noble Baroness, I hope that we may take what has been said as correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para16"></a>The provisions will affect people who enter the country with forged passports, people who have lost their passports, or people who tell a story about their passport which is reasonable but which is nevertheless, not believed. That can happen. I do not want people to be at risk of telling a story that appears to them to be reasonable not to be believed. It is also a matter of concern to me whether the Home Office wishes them to come with passports or without because they can be penalised either way. Like the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, they instinctively assume that being fast-tracked is being penalised, but if they come without a passport, they get caught for that also. A refusal letter says things like:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State also notes that in spite of your claim that you were being harassed by the Ugandan authorities and you left that country in fear of persecution, you were able to leave Uganda through normal channels, using a passport issued in your own name.---The use of your passport further undermines your claim to have fled Uganda in the circumstances you allege." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-28_para17"></a>The Government can have one of those arguments or the other, but they cannot have both of them. Which one are they going to give up?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Might I ask the noble Lady to reflect on the case of Dr. Muhammad al-Masari, the Saudi dissident?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It is not easy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I shall remind the noble Baroness of the circumstances of his case. When he left Saudi Arabia he went to the Yemen and obtained a Yemeni passport there. He came to the United Kingdom from the Yemen, presumably as a visitor but then applied for asylum after arriving here. The point I want to make to the noble Baroness is that ever since then her colleague in the Home Office, Miss Widdecombe, has referred to Dr. al-Masari as an illegal entrant, and she did so, as I understand it, on the basis that he possessed a Yemeni travel document and had obtained presumably an entry certificate in San'a as a visitor to come to the United Kingdom when in fact he had the intention of seeking asylum as soon as he arrived here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para0"></a>I think this case illustrates very well the Catch 22 situation referred to by my noble friend. Dr. al-Masari obviously could not leave Saudi Arabia with a Saudi Arabian passport, having been in detention there, suffering persecution by the Saudi regime. The only way he could get out of the country was by leaving clandestinely over the nearest available frontier, which happened to be the Yemen, and obtaining the travel documents of that country with which to come to Britain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para1"></a>Again, I should like to ask the noble Baroness what she wants people to do. If they are genuinely fleeing persecution, should they throw themselves on the mercy of their persecutors and say, "We wish to have a travel document to leave your country because you have been persecuting us"? In those circumstances, how many people does the Minister think will be allowed to leave Saudi Arabia, Uganda or any other country? Or is it perfectly proper and valid, as the UNHCR maintains, for them to go into a neighbouring country, obtain a passport there by whatever means are available to them and seek entry to the United Kingdom for a purpose other than that which is declared?
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para2"></a>Also, does not the noble Baroness think that it would be for everybody's convenience if it were made clear at ports of entry to anybody seeking asylum that, if they possess an invalid travel document and fail to declare it on the spot, they will lose the opportunity from then onwards to do so? And if, after having submitted themselves to the initial examination of the immigration officer, they apply to someone else for asylum a couple of hours later, they will have forfeited the opportunity of being treated as a bona fide asylum applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para3"></a>Would it not be best for notices to be displayed at the ports of entry to the United Kingdom informing people of the penalties, if they intend to apply for asylum, of failing to declare that they entered with false documentation? The Minister smiles. She obviously believes that it would not be right to inform people of the consequences of internal United Kingdom legislation of which, clearly, they must be unaware. As someone said to me the other day, if I went to Brazil and were seeking asylum there, I would obviously not <P>


<a name="column_1118"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be familiar with the ins and outs of Brazilian asylum legislation. Why, therefore, should people coming from Saudi Arabia or Uganda be expected, at the point of entry where they are subjected to an examination by an immigration officer, perhaps having suffered considerable trauma in escaping from their country of origin and coming via a third country, to remember that the first thing they should say is, "I am sorry, but this Yemeni travel document which I am using is not one to which I am entitled and I made incorrect statements in applying for the entry certificate in San'a"? I shall be grateful, therefore, if the noble Baroness will reflect on those points when replying to my noble friend.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   It may be for the convenience of the Committee and the noble Baroness if I speak briefly to Amendment No. 12 so that the Minister can respond to Amendments Nos. 10 through 13 together. It is directly relevant to the arguments already adduced and I can be brief.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para4"></a>Amendment No. 12 seeks to remove from the Bill the section dealing with invalid travel documents. The fundamental problem is one referred to by both the Minister and my noble friend; that is, that just as those who are seeking to enter this country without legitimate grounds would probably appear without valid travel documents, it is also the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, pointed out, that the people who have the strongest possible arguments for seeking asylum will also appear without valid travel documents. If one seeks to depart from places like Kinshasa or Nigeria, it is unlikely that one will get away if one carries legitimate travel documents. One would not be allowed out of the door.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para5"></a>Therefore, the dilemma for the Minister and her department--and indeed for all of us--is that both the very best and worst cases fall into that category. Those of us who want to protect the very best cases want to make sure that people who carry either no passport or a passport which is false will not, on those grounds alone, be dismissed. They may well be the people who have the strongest possible case for seeking asylum and face the greatest possible danger of persecution if returned to the country from which they came.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene to support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. The Minister will remember that last week there was an exchange between the Home Secretary and myself in which he expressed his feelings that anybody coming to this country ought to trust immigration officers, and indeed the whole process, sufficiently not to have to resort to any kind of deceit at the point of entry. That is the question at issue here and noble Lords opposite have talked in general terms about the reasons why people do not produce documents at that moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para6"></a>Let me share with the Committee one particular case which illustrates the difficulty in which so many people find themselves. I am a little reluctant to tell the story because, as the Minister said earlier this evening, there are matters of confidentiality. If I tell the story in general terms it will make the point. It concerns a <P>


<a name="column_1119"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nigerian lady, a Christian, who married a Moslem and had two children. The two children were shot and killed and she and her husband made their way to Lagos to build a new life. They were both shot in the street and taken to hospital by a woman. The wife was informed later that her husband had died, and she was left on her own. The woman who had taken her to hospital eventually took her into her own home and advised her that she must leave the country, and that the only way to do this was to take a false passport, to make her way to this country, and to obtain entry into this country on that passport. This she did.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para7"></a>The case is still before the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. I know that some noble Lords have been in touch with the Home Office about this particular case, but the point I am making is that, as I understand it, an appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal is not possible under the abbreviated procedure. Had that woman gone on to the fast-track procedure the appeal which is at present under consideration would not have been possible for her. That is one of the points at issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   As I understand it, in the case that the right reverend Prelate has referred to--if that lady were actually fleeing--first of all, she was not fleeing from a designated country, or one that it is not planned to designate. If she were fleeing from persecution and arrived in this country with a false passport, and explained why she had a false passport at the point of entry, there would be absolutely no threat to that lady at all. She would be decidedly helped from the moment of arrival if she claimed asylum and explained why it was that she had a false passport.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. In this particular case, because she had been advised not to say anything to immigration authorities she came into the country on the false passport and did not declare it at that moment. That is why she is now in such difficulties with her application.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-29_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I have always thought it is more difficult to be deceitful than to be honest at immigration control. You have to have some courage to look people in the eye and lie to them. I regard that as being much more difficult when somebody is asking them questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para8"></a>If these measures are put in place the hope is that that certainly would not happen and that those advising such people would advise them that it is better to be honest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para9"></a>As to the amendments, I have shown a degree of frustration about the organisation of these amendments. When I saw them this morning I found it almost inexplicable that we had separated out the amendments. We have an amendment tabled by the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh, and Lord Dubs, who say remove paragraphs (a) and (b). We have another amendment which says just remove paragraph (a), and we have a third amendment which says just remove paragraph (b). They are exactly the same amendments; there is nothing different about them at all. I tried to have them discussed jointly and I was told that it was not <P>


<a name="column_1120"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>acceptable, so they were all separated, and at the last minute they are all back together again. They are in fact identical amendments, and I shall treat them as such.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para10"></a>Article 31 of the 1951 convention says that we must not penalise refugees who enter unlawfully provided that they present themselves without delay. Clause 1 does not in fact penalise them. There is a crucial distinction between using false papers to flee the country of origin and using them to gain entry into this country. Sub-paragraph (3) is aimed at those who seek to frustrate our asylum procedures--not somebody else's--by withholding passports or passing off false documents.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para11"></a>It is that deception which is aimed at the United Kingdom, and not at their own country when they are away from the danger that they are fleeing. Asylum seekers who present themselves properly as required by Article 3 and who are honest with our immigration officials will not be adversely affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-29_para12"></a>Reference has been made to Dr. al-Masari and to my colleague in another place, Ann Widdecombe. I can say that Ann Widdecombe is absolutely right in that Dr. al-Masari is, and was, an illegal entrant. He gained his passport and travelling documents by deception in the Yemen. He managed to come through immigration controls in this country with what looked like documents which were in order, but which turned out not to be in order. What we know of Dr. al-Masari is that he is not a shy, coy, retiring or traumatised gentleman; he is someone who could quite easily, at the point of entry, have sought asylum because he believed that he had a case for doing so. He could have admitted why it was that he had to acquire his documentation in that particular way, but he chose not only to deceive the Yemen, but also the authorities in this country.

<A NAME="60423-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The point I was making to the Minister was that he was perfectly entitled to obtain the documents as a means of escaping from Saudi Arabia. What I understand she is now criticising is the fact that he did not declare at once, at the port of entry, that the documents had been obtained in the manner she described. Does it really make any difference whether he said, at the instant of seeing the immigration officer, that that was how the documents had been acquired or that he said so 24 or 48 hours later, when obviously he intended to apply for asylum at the time he left the Yemen?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I make no criticism of how he acquired the documents, but I do make a criticism of how he deceived the immigration officials in this country in order to gain entry. I also say that he is, and was, at the time, an illegal entrant. He arrived here and gained entry by deception and that is the point I am making. The reason I make that point is that I believe the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, criticised my honourable friend in another place for describing him as an illegal entrant. I join with my honourable friend in another place and make the same comment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Can the noble Baroness say how she reconciles the answer that she has just given with the wording of Article 31 of the UN Convention on Refugees? It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The contracting states shall not impose penalties on account of their illegal entry or presence on refugees who come in directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1 enter or are present in their territory without authorisation provided they present themselves without delay to the authority and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We recognise that convention. As I understand it, Dr. al-Masari was well within both the letter and the spirit of it. Why is that illegal?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I have made the point that Dr. al-Masari was not within the letter or the spirit of that article. He did not present himself without delay and he did enter by deception. Therefore, he did not give good reason as to why it was that he had documents which were not in order as he came through immigration at the port of entry. I have made the point that Article 31 does oblige us not to penalise somebody if they present themselves without delay and if they give good reason for having false documents, but he did neither.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   "Without delay" does not mean at the point of entry; it means without delay after entry. I have read the words several times today and I can give them no other meaning.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   We are talking about the Bill. The amendments are about the new proposals that will be in place and that is the whole point of this debate. We have added two conditions for people to present themselves at the point of entry because we believe that is the fairest thing. It qualifies them to receive benefit and their cases will be considered substantively anyway. We believe that it is easier for them to be honest at the point of entry, having fled from danger in their own country, if that is what they have done. If they come here without documentation there should be some reason for it. That reason should be given at the point of entry. If they come with documentation that is not in order that should also be admitted at the point of entry and reasons given; otherwise, they have to resort to deception. In those circumstances, there is no way that they can pass through immigration unless they resort to deception. We are simply saying that they should not resort to deception.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-30_para0"></a>Sub-paragraph (3) addresses a growing form of deception carried out by those who abuse our asylum procedures. In 1994 nearly 3,800 undocumented passengers applied for asylum on arrival at Gatwick, Heathrow and Dover. In 1995 this figure rose to over 4,800. But it is perfectly clear, from our close liaison with carriers and check-in procedures abroad, that the vast majority of passengers who arrive without a travel document would have been in possession of one when they embarked, either forged or genuine. They have therefore already successfully fled from their country, in which they claim to fear persecution. In concealing, destroying or disposing of their passport before presenting themselves to the immigration officer they are withholding crucial evidence from the United Kingdom authorities. Indeed, that is usually their <P>


<a name="column_1122"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intention. Some wish to conceal the fact that they travelled on their own passport, since this may give the lie to their claim that they are being sought by the authorities in their own countries. Some wish to conceal the fact, which their passport would reveal, that they have travelled here from a safe third country, in which they could have sought asylum. Others try to conceal their true identity or nationality. At the end of the day it is considerably more difficult to effect the removal of someone who is without travel documents.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-30_para1"></a>We have consistently made clear that we expect asylum seekers to be completely honest and frank with our immigration authorities on arrival in this country. Dishonesty and concealment damages credibility. Above all, it damages their credibility. Parliament has endorsed that principle, since it is already present in the immigration rules. Paragraph 341 makes clear that destroying, damaging or disposing of a passport, other document or ticket relevant to an asylum claim may damage credibility if no reasonable explanation is given. We accept in principle that there will be circumstances where a genuine refugee needs to use false papers in order to flee a country in which he has a genuine fear of persecution. Under the Bill no adverse consequences arise for the asylum seeker merely because he presents an invalid or forged passport, provided that the applicant declares the forgery to the immigration officer. But what is unacceptable, and casts doubt on credibility, is an attempt to pass off a fake identity or forged passport as genuine. It is the dishonesty inherent in such an attempt which triggers the accelerated appeal procedure. That is why we are unable to accept Amendment No. 13 that inserts a reasonable explanation caveat into subparagraph (3)(b).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   There is insistence on honesty. At the point at which the immigrant steps off whatever he steps off will there be a notice in a language that he knows telling him that he has to be honest? I find it quite extraordinary that, having escaped from persecution and undertaken an appalling journey to get here, the first matter that people must think about is to be honest. Will people be told that?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It is quite incredible to believe that there should be notices telling people not to lie as they pass that point. If somebody arrives at immigration or passport control he or she will be asked questions. The person either has documentation or does not have it. If not, it is important that the person gives the reason for not having it. If the person has false documentation and that fact is picked up at the point of entry it is important that the person should say so. We hope that as immigration officials ask these questions they will remind people that it is better to answer them honestly rather than that there should be notices that they should tell the truth as they pass through the gates. But people look immigration officials in the eye and pass themselves off in this way either by telling lies or by having false documentation that goes undetected. In many cases that is the intention, as I have just said.

<A NAME="60423-30_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   I do not want to labour this point, but I find it quite incredible. One has escaped under very difficult circumstances; one has escaped from a country which is trying to persecute one; one is probably in a state of terror, this is one's last chance of surviving, and one is expected to arrive like a good schoolgirl and speak the truth like a good girl guide the moment that one comes into the country. I find it incomprehensible that anybody can believe this.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The millions of people who come through our ports of entry every year are asked, as they pass through customs or through immigration, to give information. The most difficult part of the whole project for people fleeing persecution is to flee the country and to find a way to obtain some kind of document to get out of that country. They have managed to flee that country. They have travelled, very often, through a number of countries to come to this country. When they come to the port of entry the immigration officials will of course tell them that it is better to tell the truth. In relation to the millions of people who come through our major airports, to suspect that each one of them may be having a last chance of survival is quite extraordinary for all the people who have to deal with them. When the immigration officials are questioning somebody who has documentation that is not correct, just as in the case of the customs officer, when he looks us in the eye and asks: "Have you anything to declare?", it is actually better that you tell the truth rather than be dishonest with them. You do not have notices up simply saying: "Tell the truth when you are asked the question."
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-30_para2"></a>It is an extraordinary thing, but immigration officials will clearly remind people that when they are being asked a question it is better for them, particularly if they are seeking asylum, to tell the truth at the point of entry. That is better than having notices up in the many different languages which would be needed at Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport or Stansted Airport. I do not know how many languages are spoken by people coming through those airports, but I suspect that if it is not many hundreds, it is certainly many tens of languages. It is very difficult. There is an expectation that people should be honest as they come through the ports of entry.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-30_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   Perhaps I may make one final appeal to the Minister on this issue. I do appreciate that she is very loyally arguing the case for her department. The kind of example given by the right reverend Prelate and one with which some of us--I am sure, also, the Minister--are familiar is where somebody is in a state of desperation. He may have lost members of his family; he may have lost all his family. He may have been tortured, beaten and detained by police. He may know very little about the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-30_para3"></a>Such people come here and they are faced with men and women in uniforms who look very much like the people who have beaten them up, tortured them or raped them. We know that they are not like that, of course, because we live in this country, but the asylum seekers do not know that they are not like that. To them, they are just another set of officials. They are terrified. They want to survive. They have had a very tough experience.

<A NAME = "60423-30_para4"></a>I know that the Minister is a lady of compassion and I ask her to consider whether it is really fair to apply to such a person the tests that would be applied to, for example, a tourist coming here from a safe country to enjoy a couple of weeks looking at our heritage.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   First, I hope that the noble Baroness will not patronise me by saying that I am just being loyal to my department. I am not just being loyal to my department. I am speaking very much as a believer in this piece of legislation. I care very much about genuine asylum seekers being treated fairly. I care passionately about making sure that they do the right thing. I am concerned also about the numbers of people who do, quite intentionally, deceive at the ports of entry to this country. It is partly for that reason that we are trying to eliminate the need for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para0"></a>Those people are considered quite separately. If I am coming through as a ordinary tourist and my passport is not in order or I do not have a visa, I should be treated, quite rightly, as though I am deceiving with intent. If somebody is genuinely fleeing persecution as in the case described by the right reverend Prelate--and that was a very serious case--there are two factors to take into consideration. It would actually be better to give an explanation at the port of entry. I just wonder about the person who has to deceive his way through the port of entry. Where does he go then? At some point he has to say: "I wish to have asylum." At some point he has to go to authorities to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para1"></a>Secondly, it is very important to have advice. But that person's case will be considered substantively in any event, irrespective of how he passed through the airport, whether it was by using deceit. We are saying that for the purposes of the new procedures which are to be put in place, it is better that he should say at the point of entry that he is seeking asylum; that his documentation is not in order or does not exist at all; and give reasons for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para2"></a>We know that there are people who exploit the system. They remove passports quite deliberately on aeroplanes or boats. We know that people put them down toilets on aircraft because it is then more difficult to find out where they come from and who they are. We are trying to say that people should have an explanation why they either have no documentation or documentation which is not in order. We are simply asking people to tell the truth in their own interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para3"></a>As I said, we accept in principle that there will be circumstances in which genuine refugees will need to use false papers in order to flee a country in which they had a genuine fear of persecution. In this Bill, no adverse consequences arise for asylum seekers merely because they present an invalid or forged passport, provided that the applicant declares the forgery to the immigration officer. What is not acceptable is to pass off false documents as genuine. It is the inherent dishonesty which is the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para4"></a>Those presenting false papers to our immigration officers are not doing so out of necessity. By definition, they have already fled the country in which they claim to fear persecution and such deception cannot be condoned. It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which <P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>an applicant would have a reasonable explanation for attempting to deceive our immigration authorities in such a blatant manner.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Baroness once again, but she said that she found it difficult to imagine a reason. Many people facing something more important than any court case in this country prefer to have an adviser to help to present their case. Is it or is it not a proper reason for preferring to make the application in the country rather than at the port?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   In the new procedures, we are saying that it is preferable not to continue to lie through immigration control, which those people must do if they are not going to admit that they have no documentation or forged or improper documentation. But even if they do not do that, as was the case of the lady mentioned by the right reverend Prelate, their case is still considered and they still have an opportunity to give the reasons why they did not do that. We are simply saying that in the new procedures, it is preferable for them to make that declaration at the port of entry. It seems extraordinary, as I say, that you need more courage to be deceitful than you do to be honest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para5"></a>Subsection (3) will not prejudice the consideration of the asylum claim on its merits. If the claim is valid, asylum or exceptional leave will be granted, regardless of document abuse or deception used on arrival. As I have said, it will not penalise the genuine asylum seeker who has to travel with false papers provided that he is honest and declares the false papers on arrival.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para6"></a>The provision addresses a growing form of abuse of our asylum procedures and I urge the Committee not to accept the amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, perhaps I may correct her on a mis-statement that she made about the case of Professor al-Masari. She said that he was and is an illegal entrant. She is obviously unaware that her right honourable friend the Home Secretary has recently granted Professor al-Masari four years' exceptional leave to remain in this country. Therefore, he is not an illegal entrant. He is a person with leave to remain that has been granted in the most exceptional circumstances by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The point I was making is that he arrived in this country illegally and his case is being considered.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   If I may finish the point. What is also interesting is that having come through by deception--which is how he arrived at the port of entry--his case was considered and he was given exceptional leave to remain. He did not have substantive consideration, as the noble Lord knows, but nevertheless <P>


<a name="column_1126"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he was given exceptional leave to remain even after having come through the port of entry with documents that were not in order.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Hansard will show tomorrow that the noble Baroness said that Professor al-Masari is, and was, an illegal entrant. She has now had to admit that he is not because since the Home Secretary gave him exceptional leave to remain he is here lawfully.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   He is, and was, an illegal entrant. That is how he entered this country. He came into the country illegally. I stand by the description that he came into this country illegally. "Entrant" is the word I used; he entered the country illegally. That cannot be changed just as we cannot change how we were born. He entered the country by deception.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I have listened hard to what the Minister has said. I am trying to disentangle the many elements in her arguments. Of course, no one is happy that people tell lies as a general proposition about human nature, but we live in a world where people are seeking safety and fleeing from distant countries. They have perhaps little or no knowledge of English. They are not graduates of a British or American university. They are not fluent at understanding what goes on in this country, yet we expect those people to understand the subtleties and nuances of our system of immigration control. I contend that that is unrealistic.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para7"></a>After all, the Minister said that people may, with their forged visas or forged passports, have crossed a number of frontiers. If people are to be expected to admit that their documentation is not proper, in the sense that it may have been forged to help them escape, the first point at which they would have to declare that is when leaving the country from which they are escaping. If they happen to get a flight out of the country to escape persecution, they ought, I suppose--by the Minister's own strictures--to say to the airline, "This is my passport and it is forged".
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para8"></a>Of course, the Minister is not suggesting that. However, the fact is that people who are escaping from those countries are--because that is the nature of their dilemma--having to use forged documents, and are occasionally having to tell lies in order to get out of the country from which they are escaping. Such people have had to tell lies on a number of occasions, possibly even to officials at a British Embassy, to try to obtain a visa, but suddenly they arrive in Britain and instantly, as soon as they leave the 'plane and reach our immigration control at Heathrow Airport, they are supposed to change and start to tell the truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-31_para9"></a>If such people have had to use deception all the way along the line to get out of their country, I contend that, much as I wish all human beings could always be honest, in that situation it is not surprising that they may not know that that is a point when they ought to be honest because it will help them with British immigration control. The normal human reaction would be to say, "Look, I have got this far with this document; let me get into Britain and then let me consider how to apply for asylum". That is the way most people would work. I suggest that if the Minister were in that position, <P>


<a name="column_1127"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that is how she would behave. She is being a little unrealistic to expect people to behave otherwise. They have not had the benefit of hearing this debate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-31_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I simply make the point that they have clearly travelled great distances, having used great ingenuity, both to escape in the first place and to come round the world. England is where they want to come. They have obviously chosen it as a haven. Having arrived here, we do not expect them to understand immigration law, but we do expect them to tell the truth. When they are asked why their documentation is not in order, it is actually more difficult--especially if there is a language problem, or if they are nervous or traumatised--to be deceitful about that than it is to be honest. They have arrived at the country they want to come to. That does not prevent them from receiving advice. They can of course take advice, but it is important that they are honest with the officials whom they have to meet at the airport or the port of entry.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960423/text/60423-32.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I understand what the Minister is saying, but it does not accord with my experience of human behaviour. If people arrive, having had to tell untruths all the way along the line in order to escape from their country and obtain their documents, forged or otherwise, and they then arrive at another country, Britain, where they meet immigration officials, the normal human reaction would be to say, "If I have got so far with my forged passport, let me get into Britain and then let me work out how I apply for asylum". They will not know that suddenly because they have touched down on British soil the whole system changes and they have to be honest from the moment they reach British immigration control. I contend that that is not normal human behaviour. We should not expect people to behave like that. I honestly think that the Minister is being unreasonable in suggesting otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para0"></a>I regret that people who come to this country to seek asylum sometimes destroy their documents. I wish they would not; it is a regrettable form of behaviour. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that sometimes people do so to disguise the fact that their documents are forged, and on the advice of people in some distant country from whom they purchased the forged documents. They may destroy those documents because they were badly advised. But the fact remains that they were acting on advice and they did not know that they should have kept their forged documents. There may be other reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para1"></a>I do not condone that action. I fully accept that it causes enormous difficulty for our immigration people. It is one of the most difficult areas. However, I do not <P>


<a name="column_1128"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column 1128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the Bill will deal with that problem. I fear that the Bill weakens the position of the individuals who have to use those means (I have described them more than once) to get here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para2"></a>Let me draw some comfort from something that the Minister said. I shall make a proposition. The Minister said on a number of occasions--as I am sure she will agree, but Hansard will confirm it--that people should have an explanation as to why they have arrived with forged documents. I believe that that is what the Minister said on several occasions, although perhaps not in those words.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para3"></a>Let us suppose that the Minister were to accept Amendment No. 13. I would happily withdraw Amendment No. 10. Amendment No. 13 provides, 
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"without giving a reasonable explanation of his failure to do so".
That seems to meet almost to the letter the point made by the Minister on a number of occasions in the past half hour. If the Minister were to accept Amendment No. 13 I am sure that Members of the Committee on the Liberal Democrat Benches would not move Amendments Nos. 11 and 12. I would happily withdraw Amendment No. 10. Acceptance of Amendment No. 13 would be a way forward. It would meet the Minister's and our concerns.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60423-32_para4"></a>Finally, if the Minister is in doubt about examples, I have Amnesty International's document, Slamming the door, which cites an example of an individual who fled from Iran, acquired a forged Spanish passport (I believe in Turkey) entered the country, went to the Home Office Asylum Division in Croydon, applied for asylum and eventually was given refugee status, despite having done all the things the Minister has said that people should not do. He did so because that was the only way for him to get here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister will consider accepting Amendment No. 13. If so, we shall have done a good evening's work.

Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. But the House has agreed there shall be no Divisions in this Committee.

<A NAME="60423-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 19, at end insert (", from amongst persons nominated by, or by bodies appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of, the Universities of Scotland, education authorities, colleges of further education, institutions of further education, central institutions, educational advisers, teachers employed in educational establishments and grant aided and independent schools").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: I move Amendment No. 1 standing in my name and that of my noble friend, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove. It would be appropriate and convenient for the Committee if we were to discuss Amendment No. 2 together with Amendment No. 1. I am personally grateful for the guidance which has just been given about the procedure in Committees of this nature in the Moses Room. I was not part of the usual channels which agreed to this procedure because I am one of the awkward squad. However, if I had been part of the usual channels, I would have argued strongly on a matter as important as this Education Bill, with its implications for nursery provision, that the measure should be taken in the much <P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>larger forum of their Lordships' House. Be that as it may, this is the procedure. I accept that, and I shall play my full part.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para15"></a>The amendments I propose to Clause 1 deal with a matter we raised quite strongly at Second Reading and which, I see from the report of the Select Committee sittings in Glasgow, was raised quite strongly by witnesses appearing before that committee. They concern the whole question of membership of the Scottish qualifications authority and the ability of the Secretary of State--whoever is Secretary of State, because we are not talking about personalities here--to appoint up to 15 of its members. We on this side of the Committee agree with the establishment of the Scottish qualifications authority, replacing, as it does, SCOTVEC and the Scottish Examination Board and bringing them all together in one comprehensive organisation. We are not opposed to that; it fits in with the Government's proposals on the Higher Still project which, again, we on this side of the Committee fully support.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para16"></a>Our concern, as expressed in these amendments, is the composition of the Scottish qualifications authority. It has to be understood that the funding of the authority will come 70 per cent. from local authorities and those educational organisations that use the services of the authority. But there is no legislative right for those authorities who are funding the Scottish qualifications authority to have seats on its administrative board. The purpose of these amendments is to seek to write into the legislation the statutory right of the authorities, who will be funding by and large the Scottish qualifications authority, to have representation, and that the nominations for service on the board of that sector of education--the local authority sector and the various organisations that will use the SQA services--should come from these organisations and the Secretary of State would then automatically appoint them to the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para17"></a>It has also to be explained that up until 1st April, when the present arrangement came into being, the local education authorities in Scotland had a statutory right to be represented on the Scottish Examination Board. As regards the putting together of the budgets of both organisations, although in the past two years SCOTVEC has not consulted CoSLA on the composition of its budget or on the way in which it intended to spend the budget, up until the present time, there has been a statutory obligation on both the Scottish Examination Board and SCOTVEC to consult CoSLA on the composition of the budget, the compilation of the budget, and the way in which the budget was to be spent. So these statutory rights were with the old local authorities before the new unitary authorities came into being. It is only as a result of the new proposals in this legislation that these statutory rights are being removed from local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-32_para18"></a>Therefore, I would hope that, from what was said in evidence to the Select Committee sitting in Glasgow by the various witnesses and what I have said today, the Minister will be persuaded that there ought to be provision in respect of a group or organisations which will provide 70 per cent of the funding of the Scottish qualifications authority. There ought to be statutory <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The amendment deals with a problem which we always have whenever we consider a new board, especially one to do with education, and that is the question of who takes part. We need the relevant people to be concerned with the board itself. In the past, I have sat through many Committee and Report stages and we have had a long list of bodies of those to be included. This is a slightly different approach as it concerns persons who are nominated, or who appear to have connections with the matter. If you are doing this, you are probably saying these are the groups of people who must be consulted because they have the knowledge and they have the funding. Surely this is a body which must be incorporated and, although I was unaware of it, these groups are apparently already involved. Surely that makes a very valid case for them being connected, and I am afraid that the first point made by the noble Lord is also brought home here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para0"></a>We have a potentially very controversial point here, and it is probably the only really controversial point on the first part of the Bill. The more I have listened and thought about the Bill, the more unhappy I have become with the idea that we cannot actually vote in the Committee stage. This is probably the first example and I should make the point here and now that I had not realised just how potentially constricting this procedure is. I hope that on a matter as important as this the Minister will not take a stance in Committee and come up with something which we regarded as unreasonable because we cannot actually vote on it. It is a very important issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para1"></a>It is worthwhile bringing this into context here. It is to be hoped that we can get some assurances on this or a similar amendment or possibly a provision on the face of the Bill.

<A NAME="60423-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   These two amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, are important because they bring before the Committee formally the feelings of a number of groups which want to make sure they are represented on the new Scottish qualifications authority. We know it is natural that they are anxious about the matter but there are snags to it. We had a considerable discussion with a number of people when the Scottish Select Committee took evidence in Glasgow in March and it was interesting to hear what those with experience of the system as it now stands had to say. The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, instigated the discussion and he may want to comment on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para2"></a>At paragraph 47 in the Select Committee's report, Dr. Hamish Long of the Scottish Examination Board said that he liked the kind of balance that was provided by that board as now set up and he justified that. He was followed by Mr. Miller, who is the chairman of both the Scottish Examination Board and the SCOTVEC. He thought that the way the SCOTVEC works at the moment, which is that none of the members see themselves as representing any particular sector, was better and he explained that. He made a very good case <P>


<a name="column_CWH4"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the Bill so far as that is concerned and the way in which it is currently set out. I support that view. We also discussed that on Second Reading and there is evidence that when people do not see themselves as representing particular sectors it is easier to have a balanced and good discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para3"></a>As regards Amendment No. 2, in which the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, suggests that not less than one-third of the total membership should be individuals appointed by some local authority associations, up to a point that applies. However, I appreciate that the local authority associations are pointing out to us in their briefing that they have a particular interest because 70 per cent. of the costing is met by them in so far as they pay the charges. I am not sure that that is the answer because if the local authority members only were appointed by CoSLA the problem would be that they would be speaking for themselves but others would not. Do we refer to CoSLA? I am not sure whether we can for the sake of our discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para4"></a>I do not believe that there is any way in which they can have a special place but it might be helpful if they could. They certainly have a special role in the whole performance and we appreciate that. Although I cannot actually support either of these amendments I have a certain sympathy with Amendment No. 2 in that it identifies the special role of CoSLA on the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para5"></a>The arrangement whereby the Committee stage of the Bill takes place off the Floor of the House was raised by the noble Lord and mentioned also by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. It seems to me there is a balance to be struck. It is rather nice when not very many people usually participate on purely Scottish Bills to have plenty of time and to sit on days that suit noble Lords who are taking part as opposed to having the business squashed in early on Monday or late on Thursday which so often happens to us on the Floor of the House. I like that; I like the informality. I thought when I took part in the Committee stage of the Deer (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill that it was rather a satisfactory way of doing things, although I appreciate that if one wishes to move a large number of amendments there will be more to vote on probably at Report stage. It cuts both ways. However, I am somewhat in favour of the arrangement so far. We shall see how it goes today and tomorrow.

<A NAME="60423-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I should declare an interest at this stage as a vice principal of the University of Aberdeen, especially in relation to the matter before us. The difficulty with the clause is that it is undefined. It leaves a totally unstructured agency to take over. It is not a matter of who wishes to be represented on it but of those the authority needs to have on it in order for it to work and to do the job it seeks to do. Most importantly, the work of the authority has to command confidence. Those who have recourse to the examination procedure and who use it either as consumers or employers need to have confidence that the job is being done properly. That can only be done if the authority is constituted in a proper and appropriate way.

<A NAME = "60423-33_para6"></a>It is difficult to see how a Scottish qualifications authority can carry confidence with universities when universities clearly depend upon school examinations as a means of judging entry if the universities as a representative group are not on the authority to begin with. That is the same for all the various bodies to which the amendment draws attention. It is not a matter of who wants to be on it; it is whom the authority needs to have on it for the authority to do the job and carry confidence. A degree of structuring is absolutely essential.

<A NAME="60423-33_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  The arrangements that led to the Bill being taken in the Moses Room were agreed through the usual channels. The benefit is partly as described by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. In addition, we can at Report stage go over ground we have probed in Committee and the House can be divided and opinion sought. So noble Lords are not being robbed of the opportunity to test the opinion of other noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para7"></a>I am grateful that we shall be able to scrutinise the Bill with the range of experience and expertise that we have. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, has considerable experience of various parts of Scotland's public life and my noble friend Lady Carnegy is a former convenor of a regional council education committee. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, as he pointed out, is a vice principal of the University of Dundee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-33_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord. The useful point is that we shall be able to look at the issues that arise using their combined experience and scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para8"></a>I recognise that there has been some concern that the Bill does not contain provisions specifying how the Secretary of State should choose members of the SQA. The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, articulated that. In that regard I found the report of the evidence to the committee most helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para9"></a>The constitution of the board of the SQA was given careful consideration during the drafting of the Bill. The existing SEB system, in which constituent interests are guaranteed a set number of places, was considered to be too inflexible. It was also felt that the board itself was too large. These were key findings of the Policy and Financial Management Review of the SEB, published in 1993. The SCOTVEC structure, which has a smaller board, appears to have worked much better.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para10"></a>It is intended that the individuals whom the Secretary of State appoints to the board of the SQA will bring a breadth of experience covering a broad range of interests. However, specifying that interest groups should be able to nominate members for appointment would limit the scope for the Secretary of State to make appointments covering a wide spectrum of abilities and experience or to cater for other important interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para11"></a>The pitfalls in this approach are underlined in the proposed amendments and were picked up by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. One of the pitfalls, for example, <P>


<a name="column_CWH6"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is that the amendment does not refer to the interests of industry or employers, while the other amendment reflects only the interests of the local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para12"></a>I understand, however, that there is genuine concern that the members of the SQA should represent a balance of views and I acknowledge the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, that the funding of the SQA will rely to a large part on the fees that will come from local authorities. I can say that local authorities have an interest that will require to be properly represented on the SQA. I also assure the Committee that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland intends to consult a wide range of interests before making any appointments to the SQA. There is no way that consultations with CoSLA could not represent a large and important part of the consultation process. There will therefore be very substantial opportunities for CoSLA to make its views known in the consultation process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-33_para13"></a>I hope that this will allay any concerns that your Lordships may have about the representative nature of the SQA membership and, with the assurances that I have given about the certainty with which the local authorities will be represented on the SQA and the certainty with which the consultations will include CoSLA, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Before agreeing to withdraw the amendment, I wish to make two points. First of all, so far as the Minister has gone, to a small degree there are encouraging signs in the sense that we have been given a guarantee of consultation. Consultation is one thing but it is a completely different thing altogether to accept the outcome of that consultation when making the appointments. Perhaps before these amendments are withdrawn I may ask the Minister where the Knox Committee fits into all of this. While consultations with CoSLA will go ahead, is it the case that any nominations that come from the education authorities or from CoSLA itself must first go for vetting to the Knox Committee? If that is the case I would have thought that the consultation itself is fairly meaningless. I hope that once the Minister has taken advice, he will be able to clarify the point that I am making. This is such an important issue that I do not want to withdraw the amendment now because I want to hear the Minister's response to the two questions that I have asked. However, I can give an assurance that we shall want to return to the matter at the Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I can certainly answer one of the noble Lord's questions. The Knox Committee will be a significant feature of the consultations that take place as regards the Secretary of State making appointments to the SQA. I should be grateful if the noble Lord would remind me of the second question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I was paying such close attention to the advice that he was receiving that I cannot remember it myself. I said that the first question about consultation was one thing and asked whether the Secretary of State would accept the advice that flowed from that consultation and appoint the people. <P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>For example, in the consultation with CoSLA is the Secretary of State reserving the right to refuse to accept the advice that flows from that consultation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   It would be very fair to say that the consultation, which currently takes place before the appointment of the members of a number of bodies in the public sector, is not merely a cosmetic exercise after which the Secretary of State ignores all the advice that he has been given. So the consultation that would take place prior to appointments to the SQA would, I would suggest, be significant in the final composition of the SQA. I cannot think of any appointments made following consultation where the consultation has not played a formative part in the final composition of whatever body it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for responding to these questions and I reserve the right to return to this matter on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60423-34_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: On behalf of my noble friend Lord Stockton, I beg to move Amendment No. 3 and with the Committee's agreement to speak to Amendments Nos. 4 and 16. My noble friend apologises as he is unavoidably prevented from being in the Committee today. He put down these later amendments after discussion with City and Guilds. I, too, had earlier discussions with them but I have not been able to get in touch with them for further briefing today. I only knew last night that my noble friend would not be able to move the amendments. My noble friend suggests that I move them briefly. If he feels it is necessary, in view of the Minister's reply today, he will press the matter further at Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para6"></a>The grouping is somewhat strange. I was not able to have it rearranged this morning because there was a great deal of grouping going on in relation to the other Bill which is being dealt with in the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para7"></a>My understanding is that City and Guilds' main anxiety continues to be their fear that the new Scottish qualifications authority, and notably its accreditation committee, will not give them fair treatment when application is made for City and Guilds qualifications to be accredited for use in Scotland. They also continue to query whether the Bill is worded so as to disfavour or even exclude them. Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 16 seek to improve the wording in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para8"></a>When the Select Committee took evidence, City and Guilds chose not to submit written or oral evidence, but they wrote to the Minister beforehand. I took the <P>


<a name="column_CWH8"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity, nevertheless, to put their anxiety to the Minister for Education in Scotland, Mr Raymond Robertson, when he came before the Select Committee. The Committee will see the record of the exchanges at paragraphs 8 to 11 of the report. My honourable friend the Minister gave a number of assurances. He told the Select Committee that he would be having a meeting with City and Guilds. I do not know whether that has happened yet. He told them that the new authority would operate in the same way as SCOTVEC, that the accreditation committee would act independently of the rest of the functions of the SQA, that no staff of the new authority would sit on the accreditation committee, and that, should the Secretary of State perceive what he described as "nobbling" of the committee by the authority, the authority would tell it to back off.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para9"></a>The Minister also pointed out that 108 other accrediting bodies were dealing with SCOTVEC at the moment. They were happy with the arrangements and, he presumed, would be happy with the new arrangements which were the same. Those were good assurances, but I do not know whether City and Guilds have completely accepted them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para10"></a>The way the present system operates was explained by the chief executive of SCOTVEC in evidence to the Select Committee. This is clearly an important matter to City and Guilds. My noble friend the Minister may have more to say now in response to these amendments than he had before, and I shall listen with interest to what he has to say. What I have said also applies to one or two of the following amendments. However, I have not regrouped them because I thought that to do so at the last moment would be unfair to Members of the Committee and to the Minister. It is quite difficult to divide them so I have spoken to subsequent amendments as well. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   When the Minister replies to the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, it will be important to put on the record the purpose of the accreditation committee. The accreditation committee will be established in order to accredit the qualifications awarded by the Scottish qualifications authority. These need not be employees of the Scottish qualifications authority, but they will be appointed in order to accredit the qualifications awarded by the Scottish qualifications authority. Against that background I can certainly fully understand the concerns of the City and Guilds and of the other professional and non-professional vocational organisations which are worried that the accreditation committee may not take into account the views of those various professional and vocational bodies in accrediting the qualifications to be awarded by the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para11"></a>As the noble Baroness said, this is a serious matter in terms of the qualifications that will be awarded. It is a new start and it is right that we do our best to try to get this in context and to get it right as the accreditation <P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committee will play a very important and crucial role in the whole question of the qualifications that are to be awarded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-34_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy for moving the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Stockton and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, for his remarks. I very much hope that I can give assurances on all the points raised by my noble friend. Like my noble friend Lady Carnegy, I shall deal also with the points raised in Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para12"></a>Clause 3 provides for the process by which SQA will give approval to qualifications which meet certain criteria. SQA will have to publish these criteria. In the case of SVQs these will take account of a number of factors, including the national occupational standards set by industry lead bodies; standards of design, assessment and quality assurance; and current national policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para13"></a>This process will secure the delivery of a consistent national framework of high quality qualifications without the administrative constraints of individual decisions by Ministers. SQA will, however, operate with general and specific policy guidance and will be subject to a statutory power of direction by the Secretary of State. It will also have a duty to have regard to the interests of persons using its services. Within this framework, SQA will have discretion to exercise the functions conferred on it by statute.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para14"></a>There is, therefore, no need for the Secretary of State to approve the accreditation criteria. There is also no need for particular qualifications to be specified on the face of the Bill. This was considered during the drafting of the Bill and was rejected as being too inflexible for primary legislation since the names and details of qualifications are subject to change over time. I can, however, assure noble Lords that the SQA will accredit SVQs as SCOTVEC currently does.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para15"></a>The provisions in Clause 21 are important to the functioning of the Bill and it may be helpful if I spend a few moments explaining the purpose of the particular drafting adopted. At various points in the Bill reference is made to SQA qualifications. Clearly we need to understand what this means. Clause 21 defines the term as qualifications devised or awarded by SQA. This means that, for instance, SQA has the power to determine the entitlement of a candidate to an award of Higher English or to review and develop what is at present a SCOTVEC HNC. There are of course many other examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para16"></a>The only purpose of using that term is to avoid having to say, on each occasion,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a qualification devised or awarded by SQA". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para17"></a>
There is also a different group of qualifications where the SQA will have a role--qualifications accredited by SQA. In some cases these will also be SQA qualifications; that is, devised or awarded by SQA. In others they will be qualifications devised and awarded by other bodies. In the latter case the SQA's role is limited to accreditation and it is not appropriate for all the other functions of the SQA to be brought to bear on these awards.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para18"></a>That is the function of the current wording--clear separation between types of function. I would draw noble Lords' attention to Clause 3 dealing with accreditation. Nowhere in this clause is the term "SQA qualification" used. This is not an accident. It is carefully drafted to achieve the purpose of drawing a necessary distinction between types of function. I recognise that the full import of the definition may have been misinterpreted as being prejudicial to other bodies and my noble friend Lady Carnegy in introducing these amendments suggested that there may be some sort of prejudice. I can assure the Committee that that is not the case. The current drafting reflects the needs of other awarding bodies and in fact the amendment would give the SQA extensive powers over other awarding bodies and their qualifications. I assume that is not the intention either of my noble friend Lady Carnegy or my noble friend Lord Stockton.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-34_para19"></a>Moving on to the grouped amendments, Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, I should like to make it clear that there is no intention to change the existing order.

Page 3, line 4, leave out ("a") and insert ("an independent").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: On behalf of my noble friend Lord Stockton, I beg to move Amendment No. 5 and I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 also in his name.

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para4"></a>Amendment No. 5 suggests that the committee carrying out the accreditation function on behalf of the SQA should be defined on the face of the Bill as an independent committee. That underlines the feelings of the City and Guilds about what the role of the committee should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para5"></a>Amendment No. 6 suggests that the committee should be appointed not by the SQA but by the Secretary of State. I believe that the wording of Amendment No. 6 is slightly contradictory to that of Amendment No. 5, but the Committee will understand the spirit of what is intended in my noble friend's amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para6"></a>Amendment No. 7 suggests that members of the accreditation committee should be neither employees nor members of the Scottish qualifications authority: the members of that authority should not be involved in the accreditation committee at all. The amendments are all aimed at securing the total independence of the accreditation committee from the SQA.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para7"></a>Amendment No. 8 suggests something rather different and we await to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, has to say about that. I beg to move.

In fact, Amendment No. 8 seeks to ensure that they need not be employees of the Scottish qualifications authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para8"></a>Before I say a few more words about the amendment perhaps I may say that as one who listens and learns all the time, I have learnt today that if one tables amendments to a Bill but cannot be present, one should get the most loyal government supporter to move those amendments in one's absence. While I have a high regard and great liking for the noble Baroness, perhaps I may say, in great kindness, that every time she rises to speak she reminds me of those wonderful Gilbertian words from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe", "I've always voted at my party's call and never thought of thinking for myself at all!". The Government are fortunate indeed to have such a loyal supporter as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para9"></a>Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert in the Bill a provision that the members of the accreditation committee will be drawn from,

<A NAME = "60423-35_para11"></a>The description or the Gilbertian terminology of being a loyal supporter would bring joy to the Chief Whip of my party because my noble friend is certainly not an uncritical supporter. She does not agree with everything and makes her views very well known to us with determination in such instances. I pay credit to my noble friend Lady Carnegy for the extent to which she has been able to articulate these issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para12"></a>I would like to make it clear that there is no intention to change the existing arrangements whereby awarding bodies in addition to SCOTVEC and SEB offer qualifications in Scotland. On establishment of SQA these arrangements, which apply to a wide range of qualifications, will continue to operate as at present. I am conscious that there are particular concerns about the position of SVQs. SVQs form part of a national framework of vocational qualifications. SCOTVEC acts as the accreditation body for SVQs on behalf of the Government to ensure that they are based on national occupational standards and other quality assurance criteria and that they have mutual recognition with the NVQs which are available south of the border. Other awarding bodies have agreements with SCOTVEC to award SVQs. These agreements will transfer automatically to SQA on passage of the Bill. Consequently, these awarding bodies will continue to be able to be involved in the SVQ market as they are at present. It will also be open for other awarding bodies to offer SVQs provided that the accreditation criteria are met.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para13"></a>Clause 3 puts on to a statutory basis a structure which is presently in operation in SCOTVEC for the accreditation of vocational qualifications put forward by awarding bodies. It is designed to create a clear separation between the accrediting and awarding sides of the body. It has worked well in practice and over 100 bodies have had their qualifications accredited by SCOTVEC. I recognise that there has been some concern that the Bill does not contain provisions to define the procedures for the appointment of members of the accreditation committee. However, the clause makes strict provision about the composition of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH13"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>membership of the accreditation committee to give it a full measure of independence from the ordinary decision-making structure of the body. It provides that the majority of members of the accreditation committee must not be members or employees of SQA. It also provides that a quorum at a meeting of the accreditation committee can be established only where the majority of members present are neither members nor employees of SQA. It is also intended that this separation should be carried through to the administrative support provided to the committee. For this, and all functions of SQA, there are strict rules about conflict of interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para14"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 7, the Secretary of State does not intend that officers of SQA should be members of the committee. However, it is likely that some board members, particularly those with a background in industry and other relevant areas, will have the right sort of experience and knowledge to make a substantial contribution to the accreditation committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para15"></a>I would anticipate that many members of the committee would be drawn from the groups mentioned in Amendment No. 8 which was spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing. However, restricting membership of the committee to only those groups would limit the possible candidates for membership and would exclude other important interests such as education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para16"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 6, the Secretary of State has an interest in how SQA selects nominees for appointment to the accreditation committee. SQA will have guidance on this from the Secretary of State and he may, if he chooses, make a statutory direction either generally or specifically on SQA's discharge of this function. I do not feel therefore that it will be necessary for the Secretary of State to appoint the members of the accreditation committee or for specific provision to be made on the face of the Bill as to the categories that members should be appointed from.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para17"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 5, the internal structure of SQA will ensure that the accrediting and awarding functions are clearly separated. Most importantly, the modus operandi of the committee must be acceptable to the Secretary of State. The procedure of the accreditation committee and SQA's relationship with it will be subject to administrative guidance and to the Secretary of State's direction-making power.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-35_para18"></a>To put this beyond doubt, the Government intend to seek provision for the Bill to state that the Secretary of State's direction-making powers extend to the activities of the accreditation committee. I understand the fears that have been voiced about this part of the Bill, but we are completely confident that we can give the necessary assurances to render those fears groundless. On that basis, I very much hope that my noble friend will be able to withdraw her Amendment No. 5.

As to my motivation in moving amendments on behalf of my noble friend, that was brought about entirely by my concern that City and Guilds' anxieties should be not only recorded but responded to because they were genuine anxieties. They <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have had copious reassurance now and a very clear description: it will be for my noble friend Lord Stockton to talk to them, as I shall too, to see whether they are now happy about the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para0"></a>I would just say to the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, that I believe the Chief Whip on occasions regards me as public nuisance No. 1, and that is saying something in the party which I have the honour to support. As for the noble Lord, Lord Ewing's comments on his amendment, we have heard what my noble friend said about the difficulties of restricting the membership of the accreditation committee. So with those few remarks, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 5.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 19, after ("procedures") insert ("particularly as they affect students with special educational needs").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I agree with my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford when he suggested that, while accepting the Minister's worthiness and sincerity, there is a vagueness in most of the Bill as regards appointments and reassurances, and although I would accept reassurances from the Minister, he might not be there all that long. I do not know how long he may be there, but the passage of the Bill or the Act may take six months. There is a feeling that reassurances are given, perhaps with sincerity but a little lightly by the Minister in terms of appointments. That is why this amendment does not seem terribly important on the surface, but in fact to a group or a community it is vitally important.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para6"></a>The amendment seeks to guarantee that the interests of students with special educational needs, as defined in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, are protected, and that the quality assurance procedures will not inadvertently discriminate against them. There really should be a thrust in us all to make sure that people are not disadvantaged because of educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para7"></a>The current position in relation to students with special educational needs is that assistance is available with internal assessment, scripting invigilation etc. and if the quality procedures are driven exclusively by the Scottish qualifications authority, there could be a danger--I am not saying there will be--that the needs of these students may be marginalised. The amendment seeks to ensure that these students' interests are protected by making arrangements for the quality assurance prescriptive to be put on the face of the Bill. I am sure the Minister will agree with the sentiments, but I hope he will also agree with the letter of what the amendment is trying to do. If the words are not quite suitable, I am sure that he will find words that will do the same job. However, I hope he will give us an absolute assurance that he will provide something on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   This is a very short amendment, but it is very important. One very simple reason for <P>


<a name="column_CWH15"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tabling it is that when we deal with special educational needs, we encounter a multiplex of problems, which is virtually never-ending and is growing, because we are getting better educational establishments which are bringing far more people, who have been sidelined in the past, into the educational structure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para8"></a>If we talk about quality assurance this becomes even more important for the simple reason that people often take courses and exams in non-conventional ways. I shall talk very briefly about one that I know and that is dyslexics who, for instance, dictate exams. There have been arguments, and long-running arguments, about whether this appears on the examination certificate. That has scared far more people who are taking the exams than it has done employers, because employers are not that worried as long as they know the person has the knowledge and skills. There have been cases where this has bothered them. This is just one example of what could be going on. Unless quality and provision are tied in together, we are potentially storing-up problems. If these two are worked in together in the structure of the Bill, we will prevent this happening and prevent a great deal of anxiety apart from anything else.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para9"></a>Apart from the practical considerations of running it, you will be dealing with a perceived and possibly imagined problem. I hope the Minister will take this into account when he replies for the simple reason that he will forestall a great deal of trouble and put people's minds at rest by merely saying that these have to be taken into account on the face of the Bill. It is not much to ask and it could potentially solve many problems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am very sympathetic to the sentiment behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, which was spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Indeed, there is nothing we disagree with in the objectives that the noble Lords are speaking towards. However, I believe that the objectives about which the noble Lords are worried are very well covered in other clauses of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para10"></a>Both SEB and SCOTVEC have a very strong track record in this area. Very comprehensive arrangements are made to ensure that students with special educational needs have the opportunity to gain full access to qualifications. The Secretary of State will expect SQA to maintain this standard of provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para11"></a>In addition, the Bill makes explicit provision in Clause 7 that SQA shall have regard to the interests of persons using its services. That includes all persons and all types of persons. All students, including those with special educational needs, are covered by this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para12"></a>There is, therefore, no need to provide expressly for the needs of students with special educational needs in relation to quality assurance. I should also point out to the Committee that the Higher Still development programme, with its widely praised provision for special educational needs, demonstrates conclusively that there is no necessary conflict between high and rising standards and making appropriate provision for the assessment of students with special educational needs.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH16"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para13"></a>In addition to Clause 7, I would also draw attention to Clause 2(1)(e). SQA will make appropriate provision for special educational needs under the subsection which deals with the arrangements for assessment of students undergoing education and training.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para14"></a>The combination of the general provision and duty imposed in Clause 7 and the specific detail of Clause 2(1)(e) certainly covers the general points made by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, and the specific example raised by the noble Lord, Lord Addington.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para15"></a>Clause 4(b), which is where the amendment is placed, allows SQA to supervise the internal arrangements by which education and training establishments contribute to consistency in standards. This seeks to ensure that consistent standards are applied between institutions and classes of institution. In addition to directing the Committee's attention to Clause 7 and Clause 2(1)(e), I would stress that Clause 4(b) is aimed in a direction different from that which the noble Lords speaking to the amendment have perhaps understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-36_para16"></a>The important point is that I can certainly give the assurances that noble Lords need and I can point to the fact of the Bill in giving them. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, was perhaps worried that assurances given by a Minister today may not count for much at a later date, either because the Minister has gone or because time has elapsed. I am speaking in and on the public record, so even in the unlikely event of Ministers having to change, the public record remains.

<A NAME="60423-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Before my noble friend Lord Carmichael responds to the Minister, will the Minister answer a technical question? The rights of students with special educational needs are clearly defined in Section 1(5)(c) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. In the repeal schedule of the Bill presently before the Committee there is no reference whatever to that section of the 1980 Act being repealed. What takes precedence? Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is not being repealed by this legislation. Is that still the position in relation to students with special educational needs, even after the present Bill is on the statute book? That point must be cleared up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The best solution may be for me to write to the noble Lord on this specific point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Yes, provided that the noble Earl the Minister does not write to me to tell me that he now proposes to introduce an amendment to repeal that section of the 1980 Act. It will be all right for him to write to me to tell me that Section 1 of the 1980 Act, defining the rights of students with special educational needs, still prevails.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I do not know whether the Minister, nodding in apparent agreement in dumb language that he will not be repealing the Act, is an assurance or not. It gets back to the whole question of things not being on the face of the Bill. He also said that it is now on the public record. The Minister must know from his experience here that it is always easy and <P>


<a name="column_CWH17"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>possible for a later government, maybe 10 or 15 years from now, to redefine something and find reasons for not accepting the words that the Minister has used.
<P>

<center><B>Quality Assurance </B></center><BR>
("In respect of bodies awarding qualifications accredited by SQA, SQA may, in its role as accrediting body and with the approval of the Accreditation Committee, make such arrangements as are considered necessary to be satisfied with--
<BR>
(a) the quality of procedures used by awarding bodies;
<BR>
(b) the quality of the internal arrangements used by awarding bodies for monitoring and controlling the effectiveness of such procedures.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: On behalf of my noble friend Lord Stockton I beg to move Amendment No. 10. Clause 4, as my noble friend stated in relation to the last amendment, deals with quality assurance. The amendment redrafts Clause 4 to make clearer the procedures governing bodies other than the Scottish qualifications authority which seek accreditation of their awards. That clarification is felt to be necessary. I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-37_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I hope I can give the necessary clarification to my noble friend. The Government are committed to securing consistently high standards in education. We shall expect a similar commitment from the SQA to build on the undoubted success of the existing bodies. The amendment would remove the power of the SQA to monitor the quality of assessment procedures of presenting centres offering SQA qualifications. This is an absolutely vital function of an awarding body.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para2"></a>The amendment replaces Clause 4 only with a power to monitor the procedures of awarding bodies whose qualifications have been accredited by SQA. This would be a considerable restriction on the exercise of SQA's powers. Monitoring in relation to accreditation is in any case inherent in that process. The requirements in this regard will be published under Clause 3(1). It is therefore unnecessary to include provision as proposed in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para3"></a>As the objective of the amendment is already met in Clause 3, and as the text which the amendment seeks to remove is of such great importance, I hope that my <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 34, at end insert ("with the agreement of such local authority associations as exist").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to put the local authorities, through their associations, in a position where they play a key role in the consideration of the financial estimates of the Scottish qualifications authority. The question may be asked: why? The answer is simple. They are the major paymasters. It boils down to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para9"></a>The present estimate is that 70 per cent. of the income of the Scottish qualifications authority is likely to be contributed by the local authorities. If that is the case, it seems only reasonable that those who pay the bill should at least have some involvement in the construction of the financial estimates of the body they are, perforce, paying for. As I understand it, the current situation is that the Scottish Examination Board has a statutory duty and is required to agree the level of its fees in consultation with CoSLA, and this seeks in a form to take that relationship on to the new authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para10"></a>There is a danger that if a body such as this does not have some check on it by the people from whom it is seeking its income it runs into at least some temptation of taking on a slightly irresponsible life of its own. There needs to be this kind of check or, if not, some kind of combination of power without responsibility. We all know of the description as regards taxation without representation and we would wish to avoid that as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para11"></a>I hope the Minister can give some assurance that the paymasters will be involved in some form in seeking the agreement--certainly stronger than consultation--when the authority draws up its financial estimates.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-37_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I expressed some sympathy earlier for the position of CoSLA in the authority, and this is the part where its interest is greatest. CoSLA has been kind enough to write to me and has reminded me that as regards the Scottish Examination Board the local authority funding is 92 per cent. of the whole, whereas as regards the SCOTVEC it is 50 per cent. and in future, as the noble Lord said, it is likely to be 70 per cent. It certainly is a problem for local authorities in that if fees get completely out of hand they will not be able to afford them, so they have an interest in at least commenting on what is proposed. Their interest and that of the new authority cannot be separated and I hope that my noble friend will have something nice to say about that.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-37_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Of course I have something nice to say about all the concerns raised by other noble Lords on this Bill. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, for explaining this amendment to us. We recognise that the users of the SQA services have an important interest in the policies to be adopted by the SQA and not least among those policies will be the level of fees. We also recognise that the local authorities are likely to be the predominant source of the SQA income, as was pointed out by both the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy. However, we are not persuaded that it would be fair or even democratic to the other users of the SQA services that one group of purchasers should have the type of special financial control that is being proposed in this amendment, even if at present they collectively provide a high level of SQA's income.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para12"></a>Clause 6 provides for the Secretary of State to determine criteria in the setting of charges by the SQA. Those criteria would seek to recognise the interests of all the SQA customers. In addition, Clause 7 requires the SQA to have regard to the interests of those using its services. This provision will also require the SQA to take into account the financial interests of local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para13"></a>The Government intend that the procedures by which the SQA sets its fees should be known to its customers and that the stages should incorporate consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, asked for at least some involvement by local authorities and they will have that involvement through the consultation on the stages and the procedures through which SQA goes in setting its fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para14"></a>Common sense dictates that the leverage which consultation with the principal customer will offer to that principal customer will guide the SQA in the decisions which it reaches. So I can assure both my noble friend and the noble Lord that the just interests of local authorities in the setting of fees are bound to be reflected both in the consultation process and indeed through Clauses 6 and 7. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-37_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I thank the noble Minister for his comments. I would hope to nudge him a little further at some stage, but I now beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: The Minister may be slightly tired of hearing this kind of argument and he may describe it as a niggly amendment.

<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when we are dealing with education, technology and the modern world, things are changing rather rapidly. The amendment that is down in my name proposes that such a body shall consult, not just try to double guess, what the users of the service will want. It should consult the users of the service before it makes an important decision. This seems to be a fairly simple proposition. I know the Minister will be able to say that it will be in touch all the time, but I would like it specifically detailed that it has at some point to discuss and find out what the users of the services really require at any particular period. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-37_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I can stress to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, that it is intended that the SQA should be responsive to the interests and needs of its customers and indeed many of the assurances given in Committee to date have underlined this point. Both SEB and SCOTVEC in practice consult widely at present in relation to the exercise of their functions and we will expect SQA to build on this firm foundation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para19"></a>The possibility of achieving such responsiveness by requiring SQA to consult its customers was considered during the drafting of the Bill. Therefore we do not have a quarrel with the principle behind the amendment. It became apparent, however, that this would be impractical. It would be extremely difficult to be certain that such a requirement had been properly fulfilled given the very wide range of customers and the difficulty in identifying interests in relation to the different powers of SQA. It would also place a large and inflexible burden on SQA in managing its day-to-day affairs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para20"></a>It is considered appropriate, however, for there to be some requirements in the Bill to show that the interests of customers should be a significant consideration. I consider therefore that the present wording of Clause 7(b), which provides that in the exercise of its functions SQA shall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) have regard to the interests of persons using its services". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-37_para21"></a>
is sufficient for this purpose. It delivers the assurances that the noble Lord seeks, but without doing so in an impractical manner. The duties span the whole range of the SQA's functions under the Bill or under any other enactment. This is a wide ranging duty but expressed in a flexible way. It will be for the SQA itself to determine how to meet the duty in a particular case though it would have to have regard to any advice which the Secretary of State might give on this question.

<A NAME = "60423-38_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to introduce a termination date for the Scottish Examination Board and SCOTVEC in order that the local authorities will have a clear indication at an early stage and in order also to co-ordinate the introduction of the Government's own Higher Still proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para9"></a>The Bill proposes that the termination date will be indicated by Parliamentary Order. It seems to me that the Bill is destined for the overspill period in October and November of this year. It has not yet been to another place. It will take some considerable time. I certainly do not anticipate the return of the Bill to your Lordships' House before the Summer Recess. We shall be into October of this year and local authorities will still have no indication of when the termination date will be.

<A NAME = "60423-38_para10"></a>To be helpful to the Government and to break the habit of a lifetime, I would suggest that it would be in the Government's best interests, if they are not happy with our amendment, to introduce an amendment themselves that would include in the legislation the termination date for the Scottish Examination Board and SCOTVEC; otherwise the Government could, in terms of timetable, be in very serious trouble indeed.

The Bill itself provides that various parts of it will come into force on such a date as the Secretary of State may by order appoint, and different dates may be so appointed to different provisions for different purposes. Probably Members of the Committee understand that when they look at the Bill as a whole. It also provides that there may be transitional arrangements. At the same time, a great many people are involved in the implementation of power and in the various qualifications which are catered for by the new body. I refer not only to the local authorities, although it is natural that they are particularly concerned and have told us that.

<A NAME = "60423-38_para12"></a>If the Minister does not accept the amendment, can he tell us how he will give notice to all those concerned when this particular part of the Bill comes into action in order that they can make the proper arrangements? If they have only short notice it will be very difficult indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-38_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, is trying to be helpful to the Government and I shall be helpful to the Committee in responding to this point. I will describe the process by which the SQA will be established and will take on its functions. The SQA will be established by order of the Secretary of State; it will then enter a transitional period during which it will get itself ready to take over the staff and property of the SEB and the SCOTVEC and to take on its substantive functions. During the transitional period the SEB and the SCOTVEC will continue to exercise their current functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para13"></a>When it is considered that the SQA is ready to take on its functions the Secretary of State will set the transfer date. On that date the staff, property and all other rights and obligations of the SEB and the SCOTVEC will be transferred to the SQA. Substantive functions will then be assumed from legislation. After the transfer date the two bodies will have more limited functions, winding themselves down ready for dissolution. That is the period for which Clause 19 provides. During that time the SEB and the SCOTVEC will prepare final accounts and reports. They may also be required to assist the SQA in the transfer of their property or rights to the new body.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para14"></a>The proposed Amendment No. 15 would require the SEB and the SCOTVEC to be dissolved on 1st April 1997. I understand that some users of the SEB and the SCOTVEC have indicated that it would assist their preparations if a date were specified in the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, has suggested. It is difficult to estimate at present how much time will be needed for the preparatory stages and for the completion of the winding-down stage. If the SQA were not in a position to take on its functions by the specified date of dissolution of the SEB and the SCOTVEC there would be no other body to carry out their duties. Even when the transfer date has arrived and the SQA is fully operational, the SEB and the SCOTVEC may not have carried out their final functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para15"></a>
As the Bill stands, only once the Secretary of State is satisfied that nothing further remains to be done will a date be set for the dissolution of SEBs and SCOTVEC. The Bill gives the Secretary of State discretion as to the timing of the various stages that I have described. Such discretion is necessary to ensure that the transfer is as smooth as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para16"></a>I should like to reassure my noble friend Lady Carnegy that there is no intention that anyone involved in such a process shall be caught by surprise through short notice being given. Due notice will be given so that a smooth transition can be achieved.

<A NAME = "60423-38_para27"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 17, perhaps I may speak also to Amendments Nos. 42 and 44. Amendment No. 44 is the key amendment. It is the anti-fraud amendment and as such will receive the support of the entire Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para28"></a>The difficulty arises because this will be the first occasion on which a major universal service will be provided by means of a voucher scheme. I cannot think of a comparable major service that has been provided in this way. As such, we are in unchartered waters and one of the most dangerous unchartered waters relates to the financial provisions and particularly fraud. It is not difficult to imagine circumstances where unscrupulous providers could tempt or offer arrangements with people bearing the voucher (a voucher with a face value of &#163;1,100, but not cashable for cash) which would be fraudulent. That is clearly unacceptable and undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-38_para29"></a>When we were in Glasgow, I raised this point with Mr. Robertson and he quite genuinely took the point and indicated that the Government were in consultation with the National Audit Office. But even his words indicated that perhaps the National Audit Office was in consultation with the department. At the end of the discussion I asked Mr. Robertson, at paragraph 33 of the Select Committee report, whether we could,

The Minister replied "Yes". I thank him for his very clear "yes" on that point. The amendment therefore seeks to put in form the "yes" which the Minister gave then--that the scheme will not be implemented until the Comptroller and Auditor General certifies satisfaction with the financial provisions and particularly that he is satisfied on the score of fraud and the extent to which it can be minimised. I beg to move.

It is perhaps wide of the mark but it is interesting in this context that the Labour Party has recently put forward a proposal to withdraw benefits from 16 to 18 year-olds and use the money for the provision of education and training. That implies the use of vouchers. The noble Lord smiles broadly, looking at me as though I do not know what I am talking about, but it sounded to me as though the voucher scheme could have a place. The noble Lord can perhaps tell us whether that is a gleam in the Labour Party's eye. That is my only comment.

<A NAME="60423-39_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Some of us need it! I am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, has seen fit to raise the fundamental issues involved in Part II of the Bill. Indeed, Amendments Nos. 17, 42 and 44 seek to delay the coming into force of Part II of the Bill until 1 August 1998 with the extra pre-condition that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is head of the National Audit Office, should be satisfied that the scheme has minimised the risk of fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para0"></a>I appreciate the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, about fraud, but I do not believe they constitute a reason for putting back the date when the voucher initiative is applied to the whole of Scotland. The recent Audit Commission report on pre-school education concluded that the voucher system will need powerful procedures to prevent fraud. The Government entirely accept that recommendation and will ensure that such powerful procedures are in place for the initiative's pilot year and beyond. The department will be discussing counter-fraud measures with its own internal auditors and with the National Audit Office as well as with the voucher management company.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para1"></a>Naturally, the details of the measures to be employed to counter fraud cannot be made public--they would be of little value if they were--but they are being put in place and will be rigorously monitored throughout the course of the pilot year. The Government will welcome the National Audit Office's involvement in developing payment, accounting, monitoring and reporting systems and the National Audit Office will be free to investigate the effectiveness of the system's anti-fraud mechanisms in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para2"></a>The National Audit Office operates by advising on the development of systems and by examining their implementation. It is not for me to commit the Comptroller and Auditor General or his department to any particular form of statement at any particular time. I am confident that the National Audit Office, vigilant as it is, will look closely at the systems of the voucher initiative at the appropriate time.

<A NAME = "60423-39_para3"></a>Preventing fraud, as your Lordships know, is one of any government's primary responsibilities. This Government take that responsibility very seriously across the sweep of their policies and in relation to the voucher system in particular.

<A NAME = "60423-39_para4"></a>The amendments do not make fraud any less likely to happen. They simply seek to delay the voucher system's extension to the whole of Scotland.

("(A2) This section is subject to section 36(2B) below.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I am afraid that the guts here are again in Amendment No. 45. This amendment proposes to delay the implementation of the scheme. Its origins lie entirely in the evidence that we heard in Glasgow. At that time the Minister set great store in the pilot year to iron out the difficulties and to evaluate the scheme robustly--and great credit to him for indicating that it would be a robust evaluation. I believe he said that there was everything to play for in light of the pilot and the evaluation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para7"></a>When we questioned witnesses it is fair to say that the recurring theme of what they had to say--be they providers themselves or be they those involved in evaluation of education schemes like Professor McCall from Strathclyde--was that their concern was quite simply that if one sought to evaluate the pilot scheme it would be virtually impossible to put the pilot scheme in place, have it running, evaluate it and make modifications in light of the evaluation in time for the scheme to go national the following August.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para8"></a>The amendment seeks to give time for the Government to get the scheme right in their own eyes, to make sure that there can be a robust evaluation, that the pilot can be properly and comprehensively considered and for the scheme to be modified in the light of any difficulties and shortcomings that the evaluation shows up so that it can be properly implemented a year later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para9"></a>In Glasgow, in relation to the evaluation of the scheme itself, a great deal depends on the specification of the evaluation study. For example, it is necessary to look at whether there is an increase in provision--there may or may not be an increase in provision as a result of this scheme. It is necessary to look at the actual price movement in the private sector as a result of the scheme. A powerful argument from the Scottish Consumer Council was that because the value of the voucher was not sufficient to cover capital expenditure, there may be <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>no new players entering the market, and if that is the case the consequence is likely to be an increase in the price level rather than an increase in the number of places. So there are movements in the price level.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para10"></a>There has to be an assessment of the scheme in terms of geographical access. We have heard about the difficulties of the remote rural communities in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. There is also the question of social access and whether in areas of relative social deprivation the scheme would increase access to nursery provision. We have heard about the way in which the scheme would add to the smooth transition from nursery education to primary education for the majority of children. The basic fundamental point is an assessment of the quality of the nursery education that is to be provided. It is a very complex evaluative scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para11"></a>In Glasgow, the Minister indicated that he would make available to us the specification of the evaluation, and I hope that that can be made available shortly so that it can inform our discussions at a later stage. If that is the case, I am very grateful indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para12"></a>By listing what are the basic areas that the evaluation of the scheme should cover, it shows that in fact it is more than a tall order to say that you can have the scheme in place, do the evaluation and implement from June to August, when in fact much of the test of the scheme will only be possible towards the end of the school year. Many of the aspects of the scheme can only properly be tested after it has been given a full year of running. That is the argument behind having that period of delay: it is to enable a full, proper evaluation and modification to take place. It is on that basis that I move the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The idea of having some kind of trial period of this new voucher system is a very sound one, but it is totally meaningless if there is not a sufficiently vigorous test. The suggested two-year period was recommended by virtually everybody, and when we were in Glasgow everybody concerned said that two years was preferred and that one year was the bare minimum. The noble Lord has just moved the recommendation of the expert witnesses who said it was the only real time scale in which they could do the job properly. They thought that with one full year they might possibly be able to get something out of it. The Government's time scale was thought by those people who knew what they were talking about to be too short. If this trial period is to mean anything, it must provide the information to create a judgment, and if it is too short and does not take account of the pressures of the educational year, then surely any trial period is totally meaningless. Thus, this amendment or something like it--some extension--is absolutely essential to making this process in any way valid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-39_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   It is pretty obvious that within two years, let alone one year, the longer-term benefits of a voucher scheme will be difficult to detect, because the effect on public attitude and on what parents see as the possibilities of nursery schooling will build up as time goes on and as people come to understand <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what the possibilities are for them of using their vouchers in various ways. However, the sheer mechanics of how the vouchers are issued, whether people are able to use them, whether the local authorities can deal properly with the funding in this way, and the immediate snags will become obvious in the shorter term. Whether one has one long pilot scheme or several fairly brief ones depends on what one is trying to get out of them. It seems to me there is merit in having a series of short, sharp pilot schemes which show their tactical problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-39_para13"></a>The Scottish Consumer Council is anxious about what it describes as the lack of information about the details of the scheme. That was its worry, much of which will emerge as time goes on. It is worried about that and therefore it would like the pilot to reveal as much as possible about the nature of the scheme. However, to say that one year can be of no use and that two years would be much better is probably not completely relevant. I think that it will be a long time before we know how this scheme will develop so I am not sure how much merit there is in this particular suggestion.

<A NAME="60423-40_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to Members of the Committee who raised issues in this area, starting with the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. My noble friend Lady Carnegy produced by far the most practical explanation of why a one-year pilot will be very effective and very successful. In addition to the points that my noble friend made about the practical problems which will be highlighted and can be solved, I believe that I can completely reassure the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. The opposition of principle voiced by the noble Lord, Lord Sempill, was discussed at length on Second Reading. Therefore, while it is suitable to have this continued opposition on the record I shall not return to the Second Reading defences of why we believe in parent choice and greater diversity of nursery education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para1"></a>We are anxious that the voucher initiative and the consequent expansion of pre-school education should be introduced in all parts of Scotland as soon as possible. The voucher system, as your Lordships will be aware, is to be piloted in areas within four new unitary authorities from August this year. The operation of the initiative in the pilot year will be closely studied by the Government, by the pilot authorities and, most importantly, by the independent researchers appointed for that purpose. The remit of the independent evaluators will be to study the system's operation in all its aspects and to report on their conclusions and <P>


<a name="column_CWH28"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I believe I am in a position to send the exact specifications of the remit to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, as he requested.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para2"></a>I believe that some may have seen the remit of the operational evaluation of the pilot year and it is indeed very wide, broad and testing. So the categories and issues which the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, seeks to have scrutinised and evaluated will indeed be scrutinised and evaluated. The level of provision is absolutely essential. The impact of vouchers on the provider market; the volume, type and distribution of places; and indeed parental views will be sought by the evaluators.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para3"></a>Quality will be the job of Her Majesty's inspector. So that will be done in any event by that body. The Government set great store by this evaluation: we are intent that the voucher system should deliver the best possible results for its ultimate beneficiaries, namely children in their pre-school year. I stress to both the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that the findings of the evaluation will be emerging over the course of the year. If, in the scenario the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, paints, the evaluation only starts at the end of the school year, data having been gathered over that school year, and is then rushed, with conclusions being sought before the start of the next year, I would agree with the noble Lord that one is working to a very tight time-frame. However, we are talking about ongoing evaluation and ongoing assessment. We intend to share the ongoing assessment and the ongoing evaluation with providers and consumer interests as we go along. We shall not be sitting on information as it emerges. It will be available for all those who are involved to discuss and to evaluate themselves. Any glitches in the operational systems will be put right as the pilot year proceeds. The conclusions of the evaluation will also influence how the voucher system is applied nationwide from August 1997. The central point, which I hope meets the valid concern of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is that the evaluation and the assessment are ongoing and therefore continuously arising and continuously open to discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para4"></a>The Government are not careering ahead. We are moving steadily and with care to achieve the objective of expanding provision for the pre-fives. By August 1997 in Scotland, with the results of the pilot evaluation assimilated, we will be ready to extend the system nationwide. I see no justification for another year's delay in implementation. The only effect would be to deny another cohort of pre-school children the expanded pre-school provision from which they could benefit. We know they could benefit: that is why we are determined that the voucher system that we intend to implement through the pilot year and then nationwide is the right way forward in terms of increasing the diversity and the quantity of good pre-five nursery education. I hope that with the real assurance that I have been able to give to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, about the actual process and timetable of evaluation, he will be able to withdraw his amendment.

("(a) make grants for the purpose of pre-school education to any parent of a child who--

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 19 stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie. It is a very straightforward amendment in that it removes the bureaucratic process envisaged by the Bill--that is, giving a voucher to parents who will then present the voucher to a local authority or a school or education provider which will then present it to the Government for the money. The amendment reverts to the simpler process of the local authority providing a service for all those children who are attending its schools currently--the status quo for all those who are happy with their present situation. Those who are outside the system at the moment, those who do not have places, will become part of the voucher scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para7"></a>We are saying that those for whom there is satisfactory provision pre-age five now in place will carry on receiving this type of education. Those who find themselves outside would immediately go into the voucher system. It is a very straightforward system which tries to meet the Government halfway. It says that there will be freedom of choice for those who require it and that if people do not choose to enter the local authority schemes the voucher scheme will be there to provide for them in the private sector or elsewhere. I hope the Government see the proposal as fairly straightforward and not totally antagonistic towards them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para8"></a>The second amendment in the name of my noble friend says that the scheme shall not come into being. However, the process we are going through now makes the amendment inappropriate, because it is an amendment on which one could have picked a fight and discussed matters, seen what was going on, and tested the opinion of the Committee on the scheme as a whole. I therefore grouped it to enable us to have the discussion here and then it could have been dispensed with when the time came. I thought it best that it should be discussed to let people know the sentiment behind it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para9"></a>A substantive amendment, Amendment No. 19, allows freedom of choice but also enables the Scottish local authorities to carry on doing the very good job <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>they are currently doing in large parts of Scotland. It adds an element of choice for those few who are not included. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-40_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Amendment No. 19 is not antagonistic, but Amendment No. 22 is somewhat provocative. I shall deal with them separately.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para10"></a>Amendment No. 19 would extend the power to make grants under the Bill so that grants might be made to parents as well as to providers of education. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, assumes that we intend to give the power of choice to parents, and indeed so we do. If I hear him correctly, he argues that rather than giving vouchers to parents and using parents to determine what grants should be given to providers, it would be more straightforward to give grants directly to parents so that they could make payments to providers themselves. This is an attractive proposition, especially for those with five children, because the volume of grant to which one might be entitled with a large young family would be a significant boost to the household budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para11"></a>There is much to be said for enabling parents to purchase pre-school education directly, but the proposition has one fatal flaw which is that it will not stand the test of public accountability. It is not part of the Government's intention to ask Parliament to approve provisions giving additional resources to parents as parents. We are debating an Education Bill and it is the Government's purpose to further pre-school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para12"></a>Our proposals have been carefully worked out with proper safeguards for the public purse. They will not permit money that Parliament intends for good education provision to be spent on poor value provision or on simple childcare, or on the general demands of the household budget or the Christmas shopping list. The noble Lord's amendment is in danger of allowing all those things.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para13"></a>The advantage of paying grant to providers is that, with the aid of a simple and cost-effective voucher system, it enables parents to have the same opportunities for choice as if they received the money directly themselves. Moreover, parents will not have to worry about the complex accountability requirements that might otherwise be needed. They will also have the guarantee they need that there is proper control over the quality of the education their child is receiving.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para14"></a>Amendment No. 22 seeks to prevent a voucher system for pre-school education being established at all, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington suggested. The principle of whether or not we should have vouchers for pre-school education has been debated at length both at Second Reading and briefly today. We believe that it is the best means of securing greater and more diversified provision of pre-school education. We believe that a place for every child in his or her pre-school year whose parents wish it will be provided over time with this system. The voucher initiative will not only facilitate the provision of more places but will also foster quality, diversity and choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para15"></a>We are making a substantial investment in this initiative and we are seeking to ensure the welfare of future generations and genuine parental choice. We want <P>


<a name="column_CWH31"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to encourage provision across all sectors, whether public, private or voluntary. We want to ensure quality in the provision of that education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-40_para16"></a>This principle will no doubt emerge in later amendments today and perhaps on Report and we can discuss it from a Second Reading angle as and when the subject arises. However, with the certainty that there are benefits for children and with the certainty that we can achieve the right mechanics so that it is a low-cost scheme with robust anti-fraud procedures and it is workable and efficient, I hope that, when we come to it, the noble Lord will not wish to move Amendment No. 22 .

<A NAME="60423-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The Minister's answer was not unexpected. It is one that will have to be studied and, indeed, studied by my noble friend when he sees the report of today's proceedings. We may well return to this subject in the light of those studies after further discussions between myself and my noble friend. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 16, leave out ("persons") and insert ("local authorities").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: For the convenience of the Committee I do not propose to move Amendment No. 21 but I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 25, 29 and 31. Like most people nowadays, I am strongly in favour of expanding the provision of pre-five education in Scotland. Indeed, many education authorities have made considerable progress in expanding pre-school provision in their area. I must stress that very often it was in partnership with the private sector and with the voluntary organisations. As we move through the Bill, it is important to show that there is no antagonism to the private sector as such, it is just that we believe that by and large there is a better spread of education if the local authority plays a major part in its provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para2"></a>We welcome that pre-school education will be given a higher profile and we welcome the proposals for its expansion. However, as was made clear at Second Reading and at every stage--I remember the evidence in Glasgow--many associations within the education world are opposed to the voucher scheme and do not believe that vouchers are an appropriate means of providing a high quality and equitable system of pre-school education. The voucher approach is unnecessarily complicated, bureaucratic, expensive and is likely to create serious problems in monitoring and attaining high standards of provision. My noble friend Lord Sewel spoke earlier of the possibility of fraud and no-one would doubt that the more diffuse the idea of vouchers becomes in the community, the more likely the risk that there could be fraud involved in it.
<P>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para3"></a>I move to Amendment No. 25 which inserts the provision that: Section 1(2) of the 1980 Act (which makes provision that the duty of an education authority to secure that there is made for their area adequate and efficient provision of school education and further education shall not include the provision of school education in nursery schools and nursery classes) shall cease to have effect. We want the education authorities to be the important people as regards the provision of pre-school education--not the only people, but the important people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 29 and 31 stress the importance that we place on local authorities being involved in the provision of education. We seek to amend the legislation to ensure that the Secretary of State can only delegate the arrangements by undertaking any of the functions relating to the making of grants; these must be done through the local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para5"></a>I find it difficult in view of the lack of trust. We had some of it in Glasgow recently and on Second Reading. Underlying everything there is a feeling of a lack of trust in the local authorities, and yet the local authorities are probably more examined, not just by government organisations, but by the users of the service themselves. No one demurs from going to their councillor and objecting to what their local authority is doing. It is much more difficult to object to a small nursery unit when your child is involved in it in a personal way. I have tried to point out that local authorities have encouraged, where possible, voluntary organisations, private organisations and private individuals to take part in nursery school education and under-five education but I believe strongly that local authorities should be the ones handling the basic finances in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   These amendments are designed to channel all the money through local authorities. The noble Lord says that there is no antagonism in local authorities towards the private sector and, of course, he is quite right; we know that. I am sorry, have I misunderstood the amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   Local authorities work hard and more and more are encouraging private education and voluntary organisations in partnership.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sorry, but that was what I was trying to say. I appreciate that point because I know that local authorities have worked very closely with the regions and worked very closely through voluntary organisations. However, we should not look at the proposed voucher scheme entirely through the eyes of the providers and, particularly, entirely through the eyes of the local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para6"></a>It is interesting to see the different perceptions of the possibilities for the scheme when one talks to local authority people and to people on the ground who are interested in getting an increase in nursery education, particularly, I have found, in the rural areas near where I live. Various nursery schools, nursery units, have been started privately and are trying to do a cost effective job. However, it is not possible to get enough children to come in from the local area because people are paying and there are not enough people who are prepared to <P>


<a name="column_CWH33"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pay. It is pretty obvious to me that if people have a voucher in their hand and it is a voucher adequate to secure for them a place in a school which somebody has started nearby and which would, of course, have to meet the criteria for the voucher scheme, provision would arise which, at the moment, the local authorities cannot imagine would happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para7"></a>This is where the thinking is a little narrow and where it would be even narrower if this amendment were adopted. The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is again looking at me as if I do not know what I am talking about. He may be right but I have been discussing the possibilities with a number of people who are in this position and they see possibilities which the local authority has not yet envisaged. Should this amendment be adopted, it seems to me that one would cut off all those possibilities. We know that the local authorities know a great deal about nursery education. No one is a greater admirer than I am of what has been achieved. But there are further possibilities. We need expansion, particularly in rural areas where we have heard in the evidence that there is very little provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para8"></a>This amendment would be a mistake. It would limit the scheme very much because it would make it possible only to do that which the local authority envisaged. If the statutory requirement on local authorities was to provide the whole thing the cost would be very great. That is a different point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </B>  There is a Division in the House and so we shall adjourn for 10 minutes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para9"></a>
[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.40 p.m. to 5.50 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   If I have understood the argument of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, correctly, it is that there may be small groups of nursery aged children in rural communities whom the local authority does not see as being sufficient in number for nursery provision to be made available but that under this scheme the private sector may be able to move in and make such provision. I believe that that is the gist of what the noble Baroness said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para10"></a>The difficulty is that the voucher is pitched at a level of &#163;1,100 which covers the recurrent costs for a 50 per cent placement; indeed, much of the criticism we heard in Glasgow was that this does not provide for the capital costs of entry into the scheme. The difficulty is that new providers would be unlikely to set up nurseries in rural areas for a small number of children given the low value of the voucher. One of the benefits of the amendment is that local authorities could use the voucher value to build on their existing primary provision without the capital costs involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-41_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful for the able manner in which the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, moved the amendment and for the response by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. My noble friend is right when she says that the thinking behind the amendments is somewhat narrow and that they are possibly too provider-oriented rather than being oriented towards the recipients or the <P>


<a name="column_CWH34"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beneficiaries. However, the central point I wish to make to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, and to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is that we have a very high regard for the provision that local authorities currently make in terms of education. Their record stands well; we fully acknowledge that. When this Bill is enacted the role of the local authorities will continue to be central, be they acting by themselves or in partnership with the private sector or, indeed, the voluntary sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para11"></a>At present, local authorities have a power to secure the provision of pre-school education but they are not under obligation to do so. We believe that this amendment seeks to impose an obligation upon local authorities. It is based upon the Opposition's commitment to expand pre-school education predominantly through local authority provision. The Government, on the other hand, are committed to encouraging diversity and parental choice in expanding pre-school education. We believe that all providers of pre-school education have an important role, whether they are from the public, private or voluntary sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para12"></a>The voucher system will not discriminate between pre-school centres, other than on the basis of quality. Only those centres which convince Her Majesty's inspectors of schools that they have the capability to deliver a good quality of education will be permitted to enter the system. Once centres are members of the system, parental demand, enhanced by vouchers, will encourage growth. This will be growth across all sectors, offering parents real choice; that is, the public sector, the private sector and, indeed, the voluntary sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para13"></a>None of this means, however, that the Government underestimate the importance of local authorities' involvement in this initiative, as I have already stated. Their role will continue to be extremely important. Local authority provision is widely respected and appreciated, and deservedly so in very many cases. It would be surprising if many parents with vouchers deserted good quality provision in the public sector. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, and I live in a region with a very high standard of education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para14"></a>Local authorities' responsibility for meeting special educational needs will also continue. Noble Lords will be interested to know that the funding presently received by them for this crucial area will not be affected by the voucher initiative. I accept that it can be argued that the effect of the proposed amendment would not be to make authorities the sole or predominant providers, but merely to give them responsibility for securing adequate provision, which could be achieved by contracting with other providers in the private and voluntary sectors. I do not find that persuasive. The Government's firm belief is that parents, through the exercise of choice, should influence the volume and distribution of places across the various sectors and that authorities should not be in a position to shape the market in which they already have a substantial stake as providers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para15"></a>The amendment would result in authorities having either an exclusive or a controlling interest in the provider market. Neither outcome is consistent with our vision of a diversified and customer-responsive market. <P>


<a name="column_CWH35"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>On either outcome, parents' freedom to choose where their children should receive pre-school education would be restricted. For that reason, I am unable to accept the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para16"></a>The Government are committed to encouraging diversity and parent choice. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 would confine the proposed arrangements to specified local authorities and reflect the Opposition's commitment to expand the interests of local authorities rather than those of parents and children. As I have stressed on more than one occasion, we want the provision to be recipient-led, consumer-led, rather than producer-led.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para17"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 29 and 31. The Government's policy is that the issue and redemption of vouchers will be handled by a single agency, and for the pilot year a firm has already been contracted. Substantial economies of scale are likely to be available from such an arrangement. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, suggested that the system would be complicated and bureaucratic, that it would not deliver quality and would be open to fraud. We take fraud extremely seriously and I have already explained to the Committee the efforts that we will be making to counter that. We will make every effort to make this as simple a system as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para18"></a>On the accusation that it will be too bureaucratic, we are certain that the cost of running the system will be about 2 per cent. of the value of the vouchers, and we believe therefore that it will be a very cost-effective system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para19"></a>On the allegation that the quality will suffer, I do not believe it is sound. It certainly could not be substantiated before the evaluation comes in. As I have said, Her Majesty's inspector will be checking the quality of the education and local authorities are involved in licensing childcare. There are therefore various means by which quality will be maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para20"></a>If the Bill is enacted it will be the Government's intention to delegate to the voucher management agency the payment of grants and perhaps other functions such as the maintenance of a register of persons eligible for grants. Economies of scale would be lost by confining such an important function to local authorities. In any event, it would be inappropriate for functions under Clause 23 to be delegated generally to local authorities since they are likely to be one of the major recipients of grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-41_para21"></a>For all those reasons we believe these to be unsatisfactory amendments and, given the serious assurances that I have given on some of the points, I would urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60423-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   This is something that we shall certainly want to go into on Report. Two per cent seems quite a bargain. I do not know how many grants they will be giving out to make a living from 2 per cent., bearing in mind the other overheads as well. I think it will be considerably more unless it is to be a second-rate business.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-42_para0"></a>I should like to ask the Minister a question. The noble Baroness, Baroness Carnegy, spoke about parental choice and the lack of provision of nursery education in certain areas of the country, but said that in some areas it is beginning. Can the noble Baroness give us any idea of the private nursery places in her area, the ones with which she is now familiar? One of our suspicions is that there is always private nursery education available if one pays enough for it, but the vast majority of parents are not able to pay anything like what a private nursery school costs. As far as I know in my area, which is a city centre, for lots of people it is right out of their budget; they could not possibly do it. Many people have said, and most people believe, that with the &#163;1,100 voucher all that will happen is that the fees will go up. There may be a slight reduction in the fees as against now, but it will still be much more expensive than most people can afford.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-42_para1"></a>Before I withdraw the amendment, can the noble Baroness give us any idea of the sort of cost of nursery schools? I understand that Fife, as the Minister said, has a very good reputation and I understand it reckons it is costing between &#163;2,400 and &#163;2,600 per year per child at a nursery school. I wonder if that is the sort of figure that the noble Baroness is thinking of?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sorry I cannot give the noble Lord chapter and verse because I do not know about the costs. I believe that the Scottish Consumer Council in its original submission said that it thought the effect of a scheme of this sort would be to drive down the costs of nursery school provision. It may be right about that; I do not know.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-42_para2"></a>We had an exchange during the collection of evidence and I cannot remember with whom I discussed the question of why it would be wrong to have a nursery school in a private house. I know various people south of the Border who do this and have very good nursery classes in their own houses and in their own gardens, and it does not have to be a big garden or a big house. I was interested that when we were collecting evidence there was an assumption that this would not be a wise thing to do. It of course reduces the cost enormously if that is the way it works, and certainly one of the units that I was discussing was in a private house. However, I am sorry that I cannot give chapter and verse; I wish I could.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-42_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   It might just help the Committee if I touch on the value of the voucher and the additional provision for capital expenditure as regards the local authorities, which noble Lords opposite have mentioned. The voucher value will not cover the full cost of the high-cost places and it was never designed to do so. It is nevertheless a generous contribution by the taxpayer, and parents or local authorities who go for higher cost places can indeed top up the cost themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-42_para3"></a>However, a recent Audit Commission study of the position in England and Wales confirms that the voucher value enables the taxpayer to meet either the whole cost, or nearly the whole cost, of provision of all kinds. The study shows that the voucher value more than meets the average cost of playgroups and nursery classes, and most of the expense even of relatively high-cost, part-time nursery school places.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-42_para4"></a>I would also say a word on capital expenditure. In the private and voluntary sectors, any capital needed for expansion will, as ever, be raised commercially. Now with the support of voucher income, education authorities set their own priorities for capital expenditure and voucher income can be used to meet loan charges. In addition, of course, there are also the new-found freedoms under the private finance initiative for local authorities. That may give some assurance on the issues raised by noble Lords opposite.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   The Minister has given us a great deal of information and it is something we will be able to look at with care and get advice on, but we will certainly be raising it at the next stage of the Bill when we go back into the House.

<A NAME = "60423-42_para10"></a>At almost exactly the same time as the Minister was saying that, a report appeared in the Scotsman of 12th December. It was written by a reporter called Elizabeth Quigley and headlined "No extra money for nursery voucher scheme". Although the comments are not attributed directly to the Education Minister, Raymond Robertson, he certainly makes no mention of any additional resources, either for the pilot scheme--that is what the amendment deals with--for the voucher scheme itself. What this amendment seeks to ensure is that the money to finance the pilot scheme--and the four areas for the pilot scheme have already been announced--will be new money and will not be money taken from the education budget and redistributed. I need not go any further on that. All we want with this amendment is an assurance that the money to fund a pilot scheme in the four local authority areas where it is to be operated will be new money, additional to the money for education that is presently allocated. I seek that assurance from the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-42_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I can assure the noble Lord that &#163;3 million of new money is being made available for the pilot year. Just to set out clearly how the financing of the main implementation of the nursery voucher scheme will work--because I remember as well as the noble Lord does that we had some interchange about this at Second Reading--we expect the initiative in Scotland to cost some &#163;70 million in a full year once it is up and running. Part of the funding of the initiative in broad terms--some &#163;40 million of the &#163;70 million--will come from re-applying part of the education authority funding for pre-school children. To the re-applied local authority funding, the Government will add some &#163;30 million of new funding each year once the pre-school initiative has been extended nationwide. Both in the pilot year, and indeed in a full year once it is up and running, we are making a substantial investment in this with new money.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-42_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I am grateful for the assurance that, in relation to the pilot scheme, it will be absolutely and totally new money, and no local authority will have money withdrawn from it in order to fund or finance a pilot scheme. As regards the issue of additional resources, which both the Minister and I touched upon, 1998-99 is the earliest it is anticipated that this scheme could be extended nationwide in Scotland. We are talking about some time in advance, which, at present, is irrelevant. I accept the assurances that the Minister has clearly given, that, in relation to the pilot scheme, it will be totally funded by the Scottish Office centrally. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60423-42_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I accept that &#163;3 million of new money is being made available for the pilot scheme starting this August. We anticipate that the total cost of running the pilot scheme will be in excess of &#163;4 million. If I understand the information I have correctly, just over &#163;1 million will be recycled among those local authorities who will be involved in the pilot scheme. Approximately &#163;3 million will come from the Government and the Scottish Office in the form of new money, and just over &#163;1 million will come from the local authorities who are involved in the pilot area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   It seems absurd that a local authority should have to pay for the privilege of participating in a pilot scheme, but against the background of what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 25, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Secretary of State shall make capital consents to local authorities in support of capital expenditure.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 24 is also quite a simple amendment which does not require either a complicated presentation or a complicated answer. It deals with the whole question of capital consents for local authorities. There are a number of local authorities which have very little nursery education, and one I can think of off-hand is the Western Isles. If, after this scheme has been introduced, the Western Isles, as a local authority, were to require capital consent in order to provide the infrastructure to meet the parental choice that the Minister keeps talking about, can we have an assurance that the Secretary of State will readily and willingly give the capital consent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, for explaining the question behind Amendment No. 24. If I could set out the background to this, it would help. We believe the amendment is unnecessary for a number of reasons. First, the local authorities are free to set their own priorities for capital expenditure and would themselves not welcome a return to specific consents. Secondly, the voucher value is set at a level which will, in general, cover loan charges and capital repayments, and authorities which give appropriate priority to nurseries as regards using capital consents will be able to put voucher income towards loan charges. Thirdly, renting rather than building may be the better answer. In any event, in many cases new buildings may not be needed. The use of spare or under-used classrooms is an important issue at present, as was highlighted by the Accounts Commission in its report entitled Room for Learning last year. This will often provide an appropriate solution to the problem of finding space for additional nursery provision without the need to meet more than marginal costs. I hope with that background I have reassured the noble Lord on the general issues he raises.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I am a simple chap. I do not understand what the Minister is talking about when he says that in the case of the local authorities the value of the voucher can be offset against the interest charges on the loans. The voucher in the beginning comes from the local authority. The principle of Part II of the Bill is that based on information provided by the Department of Social Security and, in some cases, the Child Support Agency, the parent of every four year- old child in that local authority's area will receive a voucher for &#163;1,100, the &#163;1,100 being deducted from the local authority concerned. This is what we were told at Second Reading. Where does the &#163;1,100 come from?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The cost of the scheme when it is up and running will be some &#163;70 million, &#163;30 million of which will be new money. That is new money being injected into the system. So, of the &#163;70 million which will be going into nursery education, only &#163;40 million will be coming from the local authorities' grant. There will be substantial new money in the system beyond that which is being taken from the local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   This is an important point that should be clarified. Is the Minister saying, as distinct from what he said at Second Reading, that it is not now the case that &#163;1,100 for a four year-old child in the local authority's area will be deducted from the local authority's education allocation? If that is what the Minister is saying, how much will be deducted per child from the local authority's education allocation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Am I right in saying that there is a major difference in the ratio between old and new money in the pilot scheme and the main scheme? As I understand it, in the pilot scheme it is &#163;1 million of old money coming from the local authorities and &#163;3 million of new money coming from the Government. In the main scheme, it is a ratio of 4:3 of old money and new money. If there is such a difference in the ratio between old and new money, between the pilot and the main scheme, will this not totally distort the evaluation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   That factor, which can easily be taken into account, will not totally distort the evaluation. It is a matter of the evaluators keeping a clear head and simply coping with the information which the noble Lord has just described.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para2"></a>I offer a further explanation to the noble Lord, Lord Ewing. On national implementation of the voucher system in 1997-98, we propose to deduct funding from local authorities' AEF so that it can be reissued in grant through the voucher mechanism. The actual sum will be the equivalent of the voucher value multiplied by the number of children in the pre-school year who would have been educated by education authorities in the absence of a voucher system. Our current estimate of that is just over &#163;39 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para3"></a>As regards the method of distributing the deduction among authorities, we suggested two options in the consultation paper published last August, but there was no consensus on the preferred option. In any event, none of those matters has yet been decided, nor should it have <P>


<a name="column_CWH41"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been. It will all be discussed with CoSLA in the usual way of the local government finance negotiations. I hope that gives noble Lords some of the information that they sought.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Perhaps I may take this simple fellow down the road just a little further. If the value of the voucher is to be multiplied by the number of four year-olds in the local authority's area and the value of the voucher is &#163;1,100, am I not right in saying that the local authority will have deducted from its education allocation &#163;1,100 multiplied by 10,000 if there are 10,000 four-year olds in its area? That is what I have been saying all along. The Minister seems to be taking a long round-about road to say that I am wrong. Am I wrong or am I right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I told the noble Lord that he is right. If there are 16,000 four year-olds in an area 16,000 vouchers will be regularly spent in that area. In fact, a greater degree of money will be spent on the provision of nursery education after the voucher system has been introduced. Therefore if the local authority happens to be the principal provider it will stand a very good chance of remaining the principal provider for the extra 4,000 four-year olds who will suddenly come into the system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   This is not a private discussion and anyone should feel free to join in! At present, the local authorities provide nursery education at a cost of roughly &#163;2,500 per four-year old child. If there are 16,000 children, as the Minister says, in a local authority's area and the parents each receive vouchers for &#163;1,100, and even if the &#163;1,100 is returned to each local authority with no ability to top up, then less money is being spent. The top-up scheme does not apply to local authorities; it is only in the private sector that parents can top up the voucher.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Surely this matter should be dealt with when the central government grant is arranged with the local authorities. As I understand it, the local authorities will lose &#163;1,100 for each child who is with them at the moment. The noble Lord is right in saying that. If those children return to their nursery schools the local authorities will get that back and they will be exactly where they were before. In the Minister's own area, Fife, a small proportion of four year-olds are not in the local authority schools. The question will be: where will those children go? If they go to the local authority schools it will help them. If they do not, it will be a question of how other provision is made. The schools will be in the same position provided that the families do not leave them to go to other nursery schools. Then the schools will lose some children, which obviously will be a problem for them but they will have to adjust. Is that not correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I should like quickly to deal with this point. If the authorities create more voucher sponsored places with the new arrangements than they were providing before the new arrangements, they will be better off than they were under the old system.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para4"></a>Secondly, it is up to local authorities to decide among themselves as to whether they want to top up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Lyell): </B>  We have a Division and I believe that it is the wish of the Committee to adjourn for a Division. The Committee is adjourned for 10 minutes.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-43_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Because of the quantity and density of detail in this area, the most constructive offer I can make is that I write quickly to the noble Lords opposite setting out the detail and what is behind some of the issues we have been discussing. I would just clarify one point with regard to the deduction of the &#163;1,100 times the number of pupils in a local authority area. The deduction will be the number of four-year old pupils that that local authority is presently educating, not the total number of four-year olds in that specific local authority area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-43_para6"></a>The other small point which I might clear up at this moment regards the ratio that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, was worried about of the pilot scheme where some &#163;3 million of new money is contributing towards an overall package worth about &#163;4 million, versus the main scheme where we anticipate &#163;30 million of new money playing its part in an overall scheme of about &#163;70 million. In the pilot scheme areas, that &#163;1 million of local authority money represents the extent to which they are educating pupils at present who are four-year old pupils. Therefore, that reflects the number of pupils who are not being educated at the moment--hence the government contribution of &#163;3 million.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   The Minister has made a very important statement. Up until the present time, it has always been understood, certainly by the local authorities, that all the calculations from the previous local authorities--Fife region and Central region--have been based on a deduction of &#163;1,100 for every four year-old child in their local authority area. What the Minister is now saying is that the deduction will in fact be for every four year-old child that is presently in nursery education. What that means is that in the case of the Western Isles, where the level of provision is very low indeed--almost non-existent--only a handful of parents will be entitled to this voucher.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   In the case of the Western Isles, I am not immediately familiar with the details. The advent of the voucher system will be very beneficial and they will have a very small deduction, because they are currently educating very few four-year olds. However, a voucher will be delivered to the parents of every single four year-old in the area. Therefore the ratio of money being deducted versus new money being injected will be a very good ratio as far as the Western Isles are concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   The Minister has anticipated what I was going to say. In the case of the Western Isles, where up to now provision has been almost non-existent, they are going to benefit <P>


<a name="column_CWH43"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>substantially, whereas in the case of authorities like the old Fife region and Central region, where provision has been at a very high level, they are going to suffer. Fife has produced figures showing that it will suffer. It will be penalised for the previously high provision. However, we should leave the matter for today and return to it at Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Fife region would suffer only if, once the vouchers have been delivered to the parents, the parents then find another kind of nursery education that they prefer to the current provision of nursery education in Fife. If most parents are satisfied with the education service they are getting from the Fife regional council then they will stay with the Fife regional council.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Am I right in thinking that for every child in Fife who is in a local authority nursery at the moment &#163;1,200 will be deducted, and that if the children go back to continue in the nursery school where they are, that money will return to Fife? That is what I was trying to say before--that they will be in the same position as they were before. It is the children who are not in the present local authority system who will affect the scene.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Is the Minister saying that is the main scheme as well as the pilot scheme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   That is correct. If education authorities continue to provide for as many pre-school-year children under the voucher system as they did before, the effect of these arrangements will indeed be cash neutral. If authorities create more voucher-funded places, their funding will increase. Given the popularity of much local authority provision and pressure on places, it is highly unlikely that authorities will lose funding overall, and very probable that they will secure additional funding through the vouchers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sempill: </B>   Is the calculation of &#163;70 million guaranteed to give pre-school education to all four-year-olds in Scotland; and if so, what would be the cost to the state if they undertook it themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The &#163;70 million would enable all four-year-old children in Scotland to receive nursery education.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sempill: </B>   If that calculation has been made, have the Government worked out what it would cost if the state had to provide the education for all four-year-olds in Scotland; or is it exactly the same figure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am afraid I do not have that figure with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   We have had a good discussion and I shall just add one point before I withdraw the amendment. The point about the local authorities being in balance falls flat if a large number of parents decide not to return their voucher to the local <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority. It falls flat on two counts; first, because they have not returned their voucher; and, secondly, because the capital expenditure incurred by the local authority in order to provide the nursery accommodation hitherto is therefore lost. That is where the whole scheme falls flat. However, having said that, and having indicated that we shall want to return to this point at a later date, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para1"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 23 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-44_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Part II of the Bill demonstrates the fundamental difference between the Government and certainly the Labour Opposition on the Bill. We have a fundamental objection to the whole question of the voucher scheme. It is interesting that the Minister has used extensively today the word "voucher". I mentioned at Second Reading that nowhere in the Bill, from the front cover to the back cover, does the word "voucher" appear. The reason why the word "voucher" does not appear is that the Minister and his advisers know perfectly well that the whole thing is highly unpopular. I shall not persuade the Minister today that the Government have got it wrong, but what I shall do, and do in no uncertain terms, with a maximum of 44 weeks until the calling of the next general election--from the date on which the Bill goes on the Statute Book, assuming that is the second week in November, we are down to 18 to 20 weeks--is to place firmly on record that an incoming Labour Government will stop this scheme. There will be no voucher scheme in nursery education provision in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para2"></a>We have seen already the pilot schemes in the early part of their operation here in England. It is interesting to read the reports of the early results of the pilot scheme. It is interesting to listen to the interviews on the early results of the pilot scheme. One has to look and listen long and hard before one finds anyone, even in the pilot stage of the scheme in England, who is in favour of the scheme. I do not intend to repeat myself; I have it clearly on record at Second Reading that this scheme is socially divisive. It is educationally inappropriate and it will not do anything for nursery education in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para3"></a>The socially divisive part of the proposal is clear. The parents in a village community get their nursery vouchers. Some are able to afford to top-up that voucher, because a voucher will only buy &#163;1,100 worth of nursery education. An &#163;1,100 voucher will not buy any more than &#163;1,100 worth of nursery education whatever the Minister says; there is no escaping that fact. Then some of the parents decide that they can afford to top it up, and Miss Smith next door decides for obvious reasons, being a single parent, that she simply cannot afford to top it up. So we have the two children going to the nursery together, let us say, at nine, half-past nine or ten o'clock; we have one coming home at lunchtime because his or her mum cannot afford to top it up, and the other one staying on in the afternoon. Whether the Minister likes it or not, that is socially divisive.

<A NAME = "60423-44_para4"></a>It was to the rural communities that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, addressed herself at an earlier stage in our proceedings. It is the rural communities that will feel the impact more than the urban communities. But it will have its impact in the urban areas of Scotland as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para5"></a>Raymond Robertson, in his speech to which I referred in the Scotsman of 12th December last year, laid great emphasis on the whole question of parental choice. Raymond Robertson referred to parental choice in the context of the assisted places scheme, not in the context of this scheme. We are not debating, and the Bill has nothing to do with, the assisted places scheme. But there is not even parental choice; there is school choice. If the school decides not to take the pupil, the school does not take the pupil. That is not parental choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para6"></a>I shall put forward a proposal to the Minister, because we will not be voting on this today. We shall come back to this on Report. If the Minister is interested in introducing real parental choice, I invite him to come back on Report with an amendment to Clause 23, which says that the parents go and collect the vouchers, not have them sent to them. That is real parental choice: the parents right at the beginning can choose whether or not they want to go and collect the voucher. That is real parental choice. But of course the Minister will not do that. The Government will not do it. There is no parental choice. You get the voucher whether you want it or not. It is not enough to say, "Ah, but they have parental choice on how they spend it." Some vouchers, because of the domestic situation, will get lost. There will be all sorts of confusion about what is happening to wee Johnnie's or Mary's nursery education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-44_para7"></a>That is not my main objection. My main objection is to Clause 23 in Part II of the Bill. This is the part of the Bill that separates both main political parties in Scotland. Certainly, in the United Kingdom as a whole, the whole question of vouchers for nursery education separates the main political parties. I say again and put on record that we will not vote on it here today but we shall come back to it at Report stage. An incoming Labour Government--and this should be absolutely clear--will stop this scheme dead in its tracks. It will not be implemented. That should be absolutely clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I accept that the Government, in going down the road of vouchers, believe that it will increase provision and increase choice. I believe that there is a very real chance that it will fail on both counts. I can illustrate this by notional figures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para0"></a>Let us assume that there is a local authority nursery, which is at the boundary of financial viability with, say, 20 children. I use the figures purely for the sake of illustration. If it gets all the vouchers for those 20 children it can continue and maintain its financial viability. The Minister argues that if the local authorities are successful in retaining those presently attending local authority nurseries, local authority provision has nothing to fear. Let us assume that five children are taken out of local authority nursery provision and that their parents use the voucher to gain entry to the private sector. They use the voucher and use the top-up fees, because all the evidence we have received indicates that <P>


<a name="column_CWH46"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it will be necessary to top up the voucher if you move to the private sector. The Minister shakes his head, but all the evidence we heard in Glasgow from those who are providing private provision indicated that, even to recover the recurrent costs, let alone the capital costs, it would be necessary to charge top-up fees. So the five children move out of local authority provision and the local authority is left with the income from 15, which takes the total amount of income below the level that allows the local authority to provide the nursery povision on a financially viable basis. The local authority, faced with that, withdraws from nursery provision in that area. It simply cannot afford to maintain it with the loss of income.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para1"></a>At the end of the day the sum total of the effect of the voucher scheme in that particular example, and it is a valid example, is that five pupils move across from local authority provision into the private sector and 15 pupils have no nursery provision at all. In other words, there is a decrease in provision and the choice exercised by the five denies provision for the 15. That is one of the fundamental weaknesses of this scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   Clause 23 brings in Part II of the Bill which everybody has been protesting about. Part I of the Bill is something which we would all, generally speaking, welcome and the other parts of the Bill do not inspire the same amount of protest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para2"></a>When we bring in this voucher scheme we are bringing in something which can potentially, if not actually, cause division. It is bureaucratic; it is wasteful. In certain parts of Scotland it certainly has the potential for undermining pre-school education, which works. With that in mind, if we had the opportunity to divide on this I would certainly be supporting those noble Lords who have spoken because this is not the best way forward and it is that, and only that, on which I base my opposition to the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   It is very interesting that we continue to have coming from the parties opposite this intense dislike of putting the power to choose into the hands of local people; the power to choose something which is run by the local people or something which is run by somebody else. The arguments remind me of when Parliament discussed the question of choosing a school. There was intense suspicion that it would not work and it would upset all the arrangements. There have been problems, one of which is addressed in the Bill but, on the whole, it has worked very well. From the very start in Tayside people were allowed to choose their school, there was never a problem. I remember saying that in Parliament when we were discussing how necessary it was for everybody to have a choice of schools, and nobody believed it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I apologise for interrupting the noble Baroness. The Bill, if enacted, would amend the position. Parental choice in choosing schools is not working. The amending provision is in the reserved places part of the Bill.

<A NAME="60423-45_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   The Bill, if enacted, would amend the parental choice legislation to which the noble Baroness is referring because it did not work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I have just said that. There have been problems and one of them is addressed in the Bill. Of course there have been problems but, on the whole, it has worked extremely well. The fear of this system is the fear of something different. As I hear the noble Lords opposite speak, New Labour seems to be very like old Labour: there is the fear of innovation, the fear of allowing people to have a say in what they are doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para3"></a>It will be very interesting to see, as the pilot develops, how people react to it. One cannot tell whether there will be time before the next general election for people to know enough about the possibilities. One seldom has a single issue playing a great part in the result of a general election but it will be very interesting to see whether people want to have a voucher for nursery education. I hope that will come through and that, whoever wins the next general election, people will have some confidence about this scheme as a result.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para4"></a>It is very sad to be quite so negative and to be following the producers all the time instead of listening to what people want. They want to choose, they want more nursery schools and they want more nursery schools in rural areas. Although we do not bet in this House on the outcome of legislation I should have thought that one would win if one bet on an increase in nursery education in rural areas as a result of the scheme. I am increasingly certain of that. There will of course be problems to be ironed out, and there will be changes in the way the system works as it is developed. But as a general principle and as a way of expanding nursery education, it seems that the providers are wrong, and the parties opposite are wrong in being so fearful of it. I hope it will go ahead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goold: </B>   I am surprised at the pessimism of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, with regard to the ability of local authorities to keep their pupils. I should have thought that, with the voucher system, people would want to spend their vouchers, that people who are not at present taking the benefit of local authority nursery schools would want to use their vouchers and that the numbers in all nursery schools would increase, in addition to new ones starting up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   That goes also for the evaluation, but there will not be time to take it on these issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I was grateful for the intervention of my noble friend Lord Goold who makes the extremely good point that the opposition of noble Lords opposite to this clause and to the principle behind Part II is in part driven by pessimism and in part driven by some less attractive qualities than pessimism. Just 56 per cent. of four year-olds in Scotland currently receive nursery education and so 44 per cent. of Scotland's four year-olds will be in a position to request and purchase nursery education with the advent of the voucher scheme. There will potentially be a huge expansion in the provision of pre-school education because of this initiative.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para5"></a>We believe that parental choice should be the driving force. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, has an extraordinary definition of parental choice if he prefers a system whereby he would make parents go to collect their vouchers--for what reason I do not understand, and why that should represent better parental choice I do not claim to understand. We want to deliver those vouchers to the parents themselves without making them trail round the country to pick them up. Of course vouchers can get lost among the mess in the kitchen, but whether you pick the voucher up by car or whether it has arrived the post, will not make it any more likely to be lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para6"></a>We are convinced that this route will increase nursery education provision and increase parental choice. It breaks new ground and therefore outside this House I am not unsympathetic to some of the concerns people have. This is a scheme with which they are not familiar and therefore one tends to entertain the darkest notions when one is not quite sure what is coming one's way. But I am astonished at some of the deliberate scaremongering that is coming from noble Lords opposite, particularly as it can only undermine the confidence that some parents will have in the prospects which this initiative hopes to offer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para7"></a>The Domesday scenario pictured by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is technically possible but, as I said, with a huge increase in the demand for nursery education in Scotland resulting from nursery vouchers it is very unlikely that a local authority school which is offering decent nursery education will start losing children. There may be another provider of education nearby which attracts five children from the school that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, was imagining. However, at the same time there will be many more children in that area who suddenly, for the first time, have access to nursery education. If that school is providing a service of some quality it has no need to fear. If it is providing a service that is inferior to the service being provided by other competitive providers then it does have something to fear. But beyond that, there is a huge increase in customers and consumers who will be requesting and demanding education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para8"></a>I return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goold. On the whole, local authorities have a good record, especially in some areas, of providing nursery education. They will find that their market of potential customers is about to increase significantly and therefore there will be winners and not losers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para9"></a>I would like to stress a point that I made earlier. The Audit Commission studied the position in England and Wales and it confirmed that the voucher value enables a taxpayer to meet either the whole cost, or nearly the whole cost, of provision of all kinds. We see no reason why the commission report on England and Wales should not have a relevance to the circumstances in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para10"></a>I could defend Clause 23 at length, but I shall not do so because we more or less covered the ground in the debate on the various other amendments. I summarise by stressing our fundamental belief that we want to see nursery education expanded; that parental choice should be the driving force behind it; and that not only <P>


<a name="column_CWH49"></a>

<B>23 Apr 1996 : Column CWH49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increased quantity and diversity of education from local authorities, the private sector and the voluntary sector should ensue but, indeed, quality will also be a watchword of the Scottish initiative on nursery vouchers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423-45_para11"></a>We realise that there is no issue of principle as regards the clause and this part from noble Lords opposite. Pessimism is the less attractive feature of the Opposition as regards the principle. It is the absolute determination to prevent parents from being the principal point of choice that I find much more uncomfortable and much more unattractive. No doubt we shall return to debate Clause 23, Part II, at the Report stage when we can cover this ground again, but at the moment I would commend to the Committee that the clause stands part of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="60423-45_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   Before I beg leave to withdraw my Motion that Clause 23 shall not stand part of the Bill, I give notice again that we will return to this matter on Report. I am always interested to hear Government Ministers, particularly for Scotland, complaining that Opposition politicians are distorting their case. I think I have said before that when I was a Minister at the Scottish Office there were nine or ten press officers. There are now around 35 or 36--almost four press officers for every Tory MP in Scotland--and they cannot get their case across; and we get the blame for that. There is nothing between the Minister and myself on Labour-controlled authorities, and they are all more or less Labour-controlled in Scotland now. There is nothing between us on the desire to expand nursery education and to involve parents in the decision-making process--nothing between us on that at all. Our objection is to this divisive voucher scheme and to the dangers that it holds. That is why it will not be introduced under a Labour Government. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>Question that Clause 23 stand part of the Bill. It will stand part of the Bill. I understand that that is the will of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-46_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   We are under a difficulty now. If when we come to Report stage we are told that the Committee decided that Clause 23 should stand part of the Bill, does that mean that we cannot return to this matter at that time? I have to say that if the Lord Chairman's ruling earlier today had been in line with what the noble Lord the Deputy Chairman has just said, we could have voted now on this. My understanding is that all through this Committee's proceedings no votes have been taken or recorded. So can we return to this or can we not? Because if we cannot return to it, we want to vote on it now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-46_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   We were told at the outset of the Committee stage that there would be no votes, and because of that we can return to absolutely anything.

<A NAME="60423-46_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   What we are doing here, as I understand it, is merely discussing everything, but the form of the discussion is the form we take for a normal Committee stage. It has been accepted that we will allow everything to go through in an unamended form. Am I correct? Is that in effect what the noble Lord the Deputy Chairman is saying about this--that we are going through the clauses, and it is a case of agreeing to disagree without committing ourselves to any discussion made here; and it is merely a convention and a matter of words to keep us progressing through the Bill as is normally done inside the Chamber? If that is it, it covers everybody's concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60423-46_spmin2"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  I am sure the noble Lord was here at the commencement of proceedings this afternoon, when the Lord Chairman proposed to the Committee a document that I have before me. I will not go through it again, but I hope that I may clear up any problems with the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael--that this Committee goes through each stage of the Bill just as if we were in Committee elsewhere in the House, and that is what I have done today. I understand that there may be further discussions on Report but that will be a matter for the whole House, which will receive the report of this Committee.

<FONT SIZE=3>support for the years (a) 1992-93; (b) 1993-94; (c) 1994-95; and (d) 1995-96 (target and outturn if available), as measured (i) by internal management checks; and (ii) by the National Audit Office (NAO); and what are the estimated costs, or savings, to the taxpayer for each 1 per cent. drop in accuracy below 95 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423w01_para9"></a>Available information on targets and outturn are detailed in the attached tables.
<P>

<A NAME = "60423w01_para10"></a>It is not possible to make direct comparisons between percentage point improvements in the accuracy rate and the costs to the taxpayer. Causes of error vary considerably as does the monetary value associated with those errors. The overall monetary value of error in 1994-95, based on the NAO assessment, was &#163;728.8 million, consisting of &#163;546.1 million, in overpayment and &#163;182.7 million underpayment of benefit.
