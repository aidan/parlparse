Only 16 countries have ratified the convention. With 35 countries required, there is little prospect of the convention entering into force. Despite that, its principles are widely applied.

Given the warnings about the impact of climate change on fresh water resources, and given the millennium development goal that hopes to reduce by half the number of people without access to fresh water, will the United Kingdom ensure at the Bali conference that priority is given to the allocation of funding for the management of fresh water resources?</p>

Africa is the region that is most vulnerable to climate change. It is projected that by 2020 between 75 million and 250 million people will be exposed to an increase in water stress due to climate change, and that agricultural productivity will have been severely compromised by at least a 10 per cent decline in rainfall. Therefore we will make the point strongly at Bali, although it is not a pledging conference so we may have to find other forums to secure more resources to redress the matter.</p>

The UK did not accede to it because of difficulties around the waters of Northern Ireland versus the Republic, which have subsequently been well resolved through EU arrangements. That means that we have no direct waterways of our own to be affected. However, that does not prevent us using the principles of the convention in parts of the world such as the Nile basin, where we are providing assistance to countries that share common water fronts.</p>

Would it not be a good idea to adopt the same practical approaches, particularly bearing in mind that, since dams have been built on the Euphrates in Turkey, the quantity of water flowing into Iraq has decreased by 50 per cent?</p>

However, even in the case of the Nile basin, and other areas where we have successfully supported arrangements, such approaches are arrived at between the countries that share those common water tables. Again, we would be extremely open to supporting an agreement between those three countries. Given the state of political relations there, however, we will first need to see a change in bilateral relationships between the three countries. An outcome of that would be a chance to work on their common water problems.</p>

How many people like that boy&#151;mentally ill and vulnerable people and those with learning difficulties&#151;will be among the 90,000 or so whom the noble Lord has told us he expects to be locking up in three years&#146; time?

One reason why there is a higher prison population is that more offenders are being brought to justice. There is greater focus on the enforcement of sentences in this country and a greater emphasis on public protection. Crime is coming down. The Government have no need to apologise for that.</p>

Do the Government really believe that the Titan prisons, which are now under discussion, are the solution? I dare to cast doubt on this course of action because on the Isle of Wight there are three prisons&#151;Parkhurst, Albany and Camp Hill&#151;that are adjacent to each other yet serve different and distinct categories of inmates and can do so more effectively because they are separate and not part of one big institution.</p>

He almost makes the case for the Titan prisons. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, said that by going for these very large sites and new build there is every opportunity to ensure that conditions are as effective as possible and that good design can lead to good security and good rehabilitative procedures. Within such a site it would be possible, for instance, to have five separate units of 500 each, where one would have the advantage of managing smaller units. Obviously, we shall debate this in the months ahead, but I hope that noble Lords will not simply dismiss Titans without looking at what the noble Lord, Lord Carter, actually said.</p>

Does he regret the fact that we in this country place in our secure estate so many more children than our neighbours do? Will he pay tribute to the social workers, the foster carers and the residential childcare workers who do so much to keep children who have been hurt in their previous experience from entering custody? Does he recognise that we very much need to raise their status if we are to prevent more children who have been harmed in the past from ending up in custody? That is not to abnegate the responsibility for other children, but we must admit that many of our children are not given the assistance that they need to stay out of custody.</p>

However, there will always be a need for some custodial settings. Of course I pay tribute to social workers and probation officers, but unlike many noble Lords I also pay tribute to the staff working in custodial settings, who have a very challenging job to do.</p>

That is despite the unanimous demand from the UN Security Council and from the IAEA that it should stop doing so. Accordingly, we will continue to act in the UN, in the EU and bilaterally to persuade Iran to change its approach and comply with its international responsibilities.</p>

On the other hand, the National Intelligence Estimate seems to all of us to change the context in which we are negotiating with Iran, particularly since it confirms that in 2003 the then Iranian Government made a generous offer to negotiate directly with the United States, which the Bush Administration turned down. Should we not now be pursuing direct talks with the Iranians and pulling the Americans into those talks, which must include security guarantees and greater economic co-operation, particularly as we need Iranian co-operation in Afghanistan and Iraq?</p>

I remind him that, for us, the two essential elements are that a programme of uranium enhancement continues, for which we can see no civilian purpose and that, secondly, this involves a Government who are rightly heavily distrusted by ourselves and others. Our position to the Iranians is clear: allow an arrangement that does not say, in the famous words of President Reagan, &#147;Trust but verify&#148;, but which says, &#147;Verify so that we can trust&#148;. If those conditions are met, negotiations on all outstanding matters involving Iran, with the United States among others, are very much on the cards following such an agreement.</p>

There is a clear distinction between what in 2003 was thought to be the almost certain movement of Iran towards enrichment ending in a nuclear weapons programme, and the most recent estimate, which says with high confidence that, at least up until the publication of the estimate, there is no evidence of a weapons system being developed. Given that, will the Minister consider&#151;because this is crucial to world peace&#151;whether it might be appropriate for the Iranians to change to the agenda of the Baghdad talks, which he knows are going on and at which Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that any issues that any member of those talks wishes to raise could be raised? Would it not therefore be wise to permit those talks to extend to regional security, which is at the heart of Iran&#146;s profound concerns about the danger of being attacked?</p>

Secondly, and more generally on the Baghdad talks, the United States has said that the opportunities for Iraq and Iran to discuss their border and security issues, for the United States to participate through the Baghdad talks and for a broader regional set of actors to participate in different UN forums are all possibilities. I remind her that the United States has also been clear that general talks between the US and Iran on overall global issues between them must await a solution to this enrichment issue.</p>

The NIE assessment has been in every newspaper and has had a major influence on opinion here, in the rest of Europe and in Tehran. What, in the Minister&#146;s evaluation, is the NIE report saying? What stopped in 2003? Was it weaponisation&#151;the possibility of moving from enrichment, which continues, to weapons grade uranium and weapons manufacture? Were missiles stopped? Or should we regard this with the same value as we regard other intelligence reports that told us that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="07121139000101">The amendment aims simply to ensure that the Bill has a proper aim. The logic behind it is straightforward: if the Bill seeks to solve the problem of climate change, that should be on the face of the Bill. As it stands, the Bill&#146;s only real objective is to reduce the amount of UK emissions by an arbitrary figure, which even the Government now seem to recognise might not necessarily be the right one. Why is the Bill&#146;s true purpose not reflected in the legislation?</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="07121139000102">We take our cue in mentioning the 2-degree increase in temperature from what seems to be the general consensus in the scientific community. That is what we seek to address. Indeed, the text of the amendment is based on a European Council document, cited by WWF. If the Bill is to have the scope that the Government seem to hope for it&#151;that it is to be a serious assault on the problems associated with the rise in the earth&#146;s temperature&#151;we see no reason why this should not be reflected in legislation. We hope that the Minister will agree. If this is the scientifically identified problem, we should not shy away from naming it.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="07121139000103">The amendment would also create a general duty, which we believe would focus the Bill. It is necessary to ensure that the committee sets a new, higher target for 2050, and to provide a framework or focal point for the other matters on which the committee will be working. This general duty means that our amendment goes further than the Liberal Democrat amendment, although it goes very much in a similar direction.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="07121139000104">The Second Reading debate indicated that there will be much discussion in Committee about the precise percentage of reductions in carbon emissions. The Bill&#146;s professed goal is being disputed. As all your Lordships agree that the genuine overall aim is to stop global warming, will the Minister consider reflecting this consensus in the legislation in the beginning? Any debate on the objectives of the Bill should be tethered to the scientific reality of the more general purpose of this legislation. In essence, we want to ensure that our objectives are clear. Although the magnitude of this problem is daunting, that should not keep it from being stated in the Bill.</p>

It is important that your Lordships recognise that we, too, on these Benches recognise that this is probably one of the most important issues ever to come before your Lordships&#146; House. That is why there is yet another amendment to an opening title in my name.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="07121139000106">Climate change has in the past been seen as an issue concerned solely with the environment, but I shall take a few moments to explain why it is so much more important and wide ranging. That is why my amendment includes a subsection to require the Prime Minister and other Secretaries of State to take personal responsibility for this and not to leave it simply in one area.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="07121139000107">First, climate change is an economic issue.  Sir Nicholas Stern&#146;s report for Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury illustrated this strongly, setting out clearly and powerfully the costs of dealing with climate change  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now and the vastly greater costs that will inevitably fall on us if we do very little at this stage.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="07121139000108">Secondly, climate change is a key development issue. Recent Christian Aid research from Bolivia found that communities have noticed detailed and profound changes in the local weather and in plant and animal life. This is having an effect on their local food supply, the clothes that they wear, their sources of income and how they live.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="07121139000109">Thirdly, climate change is a security issue. My noble friends will know of my interest in the Sudan, with which the diocese of Salisbury has had links for some 35 years. The conflict in Darfur has been described as the first climate change war. It is obvious, but still important to say, that the causes of any war are complex and manifold and that the conflict and consequent destabilisation in Darfur have a multitude of causes. However, greater pressure on scarce land and water resources has clearly contributed enormously, just as it has in relation to the use of the waters in the Upper Nile area. As in so many areas, climate change does not create the problem, but it does hugely worsen it. Sudan is the country with the dubious distinction of having the highest number of internally displaced persons&#151;more than 5 million. One feature of a world in which the climate is allowed permanently and catastrophically to change would be massive increases in such displacement and in the overall levels of migration.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="07121139000110">Fourthly, climate change is an issue of justice. The poorest countries which are feeling the very worst impact of the problems that I described are the ones that have contributed and largely still contribute the least to the problem. We must act on that.</p>

<a name="71211-0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="07121139000111">I am concerned that the targets in the Bill are not strong enough. They were drawn up seven years ago and they are out of date. It is right for the Government to say that they will be put before the committee established by the Bill, but it is bad practice for us to pass a Bill that is already out of date when we start considering it. That is why it is important that we commit the leaders of our country&#151;the Prime Minister and the heads of all the departments&#151;to act together in this matter. It is not a matter just for the department dealing with environmental issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="07121139000112">The Tyndall Centre at the University of Manchester has said that if every country adopted Bills that only included equivalent levels of emission, global temperatures would rise by 4 to 5 degrees centigrade. Someone should take responsibility for this in the world and offer leadership. If we go on telling other people what to do about things but do not do anything ourselves, we will be in a weak position to take any leadership on this matter in the world. It will not do to stand by waiting for somebody else to take responsibility. That is why we need this Bill. Of course it can legislate only for what we do in this country, but it must include the whole range of the issues that I outlined. That is why my amendment uses rather stronger terms than those used by my noble colleagues.</p>

<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord, Lord Taylor: we support his amendment as he supports ours. There is not a great deal of political debate among the parties&#151;even within the Government&#146;s party&#151;about what we are trying to achieve in this Bill. However, how we actually achieve that objective will suffer from some variance. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, asked whether there was a precedent for this type of legislation. Of course there is: Kyoto is a classic example of something that we and a vast number of other countries signed up to. This is actually ratifying how we deal with the amount of emissions.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="07121139000114">Amendment No. 142 deals with the aims of the committee. One of the problems that we have is with the committee itself, which has not yet come into existence&#151;I do not believe that the members of the committee have been interviewed yet and they will have no power until the legislation comes into force. The committee will deal with science that is continually developing. The right reverend Prelate described how science is becoming old and how targets are being revised even as we speak. However, the 2 degrees Celsius target is most important because it is the one that most scientists agree will cause catastrophic change: it is the tipping point. Amendment No. 142 would ensure that the committee had an overarching aim to remind the Government that that was the target that we must meet.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="07121139000115">Of course, if it was only up to the British Government to meet this target, the situation would be a great deal simpler. We have only a small influence on the total amount of gases emitted. However, if reports in the papers are to be believed, the amount of carbon dioxide that we are emitting has exceeded the levels that we thought had been reached, because of the carbon that we export to other producing countries. Amendment No. 157 would make it clear to the committee that that should be one of its objectives, along with making sure that recommendations of further cuts dealt with the rise of 2 degrees Celsius. That would be a clear aim of the committee&#146;s recommendations.</p>

The Bill and the amendments that have been tabled should have a clear objective, but that is a matter for speeches rather than for definition in the Bill. It is important to recognise whether the Bill is justiciable. No amendments can address that point. As I say, the objectives must be defined by the Minister in his speech in support of the Bill. It is an appropriate matter to raise at Second Reading, but it is not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill. It is wholly inappropriate to try to illustrate the purposes of the Bill in a clause. If we applied domestic legislation as a precedent, the noble Lord could not point to a situation where that had been done. Of course, it has been argued that we are faced with a new situation, which we are. That does not mean that we have to devote ourselves to an irrelevant consideration as far as the Bill is concerned. I think that it is an irrelevant consideration&#151;important to raise at Second Reading, but not, as a matter of course, in the Bill itself.</p>

He made the point that Secretaries of State should be made directly responsible for the actions required. Did he really mean to refer to what the Bill calls the &#147;national authorities&#148;, meaning Ministers in the devolved Assemblies as well? I realise that he speaks from the Benches of the Church of England, but I do not think that the intention of his amendment will be met unless the devolved Assemblies are also given responsibility.</p>

If this objective is to be put in the Bill, plainly it must be capable of being decided in court whether that objective has been fulfilled. What is the pre-industrial level? How does one know what the pre-industrial level was? Even more fantastically, what are the &#147;pre-industrial levels&#148;&#151;in the plural&#151;as appear in both proposed new clauses? How on earth can an average temperature increase be of more than 2 degrees above various pre-industrial levels? The temperature can only possibly have risen above a specific pre-industrial level that is capable of absolute ascertainment.</p>

The difficulty with temperatures is that they are very imprecise. The historical record clearly indicates that there have been considerable fluctuations in temperature over time. The record can be traced much further back than the pre-industrial level if one looks at the archaeological record. A more positive measure of what is going on in the atmosphere has always been, and still is, the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide. We can take that record back for a million years through the use of air bubbles in ice cores, which also contain carbon dioxide. That has been done. For roughly a million years, until somewhere in the 19th century, that level fluctuated around 270 parts per million, give or take about 10 or 15 parts. That record is consistent. So that is the first problem I have with this.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="07121139000120">Secondly, 2 degrees centigrade where? Are we talking about 2 degrees centigrade here, 2 degrees centigrade in central Africa or 2 degrees centigrade in other places? If my reading is correct, some fairly recent research has shown that the temperature in this country has risen in the past decade by nearly 1 degree centigrade on average. If we were to keep up that rate&#151;and that is where we are today&#151;we would be way over  2 degrees centigrade. That indicates that we are perhaps already past the tipping point.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="07121139000121">The third point about the 2 degrees centigrade is that it is severely open to question whether we might not already have gone past the point which will take our temperatures up to that level and beyond it, in which case we have something of a problem. So although I agree with absolutely everything that has been said, I find myself in considerable difficulty over including these amendments in the Bill.</p>

It is not as though they plucked the 2 degrees out of the air. The Joint Committee received an immense amount of evidence from very eminent scientists about what the Bill should aim to do. I believe that their amendment results from that. It is not something that they have thought up for themselves.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="07121139000124">The part of the amendment that I particularly support concerns the fair and equitable concept. Although I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, says about leadership&#151;the Government said a lot about the leadership role that the Bill plays&#151;the Bill should, for the reasons laid out by the right reverend Prelate, be as much about cleaning up our own act and setting our own house in order as telling the rest of the world what to do. The amendment is particularly important because it would set the tone for the rest of the Bill. As we debate the level at which international credits should be set and what role the EU Emissions Trading Scheme should play we should keep very much in mind that individuals in this nation consume three, four or even six times as much as people not even in the poorest developing countries of the world but those on a middle income. We are really very greedy. We should make sure that we start to play a fair and equitable role and do not rely on some of the mechanisms that we could rely on, which would do very little. The amendment would establish a powerful context  for that.</p>

The arguments put forward by the proposers of all three amendments seem to me strong and convincing. This is an exceptional Bill, as the Government have said many times. Therefore, it is reasonable that it should have some exceptional features. Therefore, if it does, it is also reasonable, to depart from precedent to this extent. I see the logic of the points made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. However, on the question of justiciability, this seems an issue which arises in relation to other targets in the Bill and not just the 2 degrees centigrade. I am not certain that this is relevant to these clauses. As far as the figures are concerned, the science has evolved. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was saying, we had much evidence put to us on the Joint Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="07121139000126">The science has evolved enough for specific figures to be feasible, testable and satisfactory and to be included in this Bill. Therefore, I support the direction of Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3. However, I believe that the clearer, shorter and simpler this Bill&#146;s objective is, the better&#151;in particular, with regard to clarity of the 2 degrees centigrade figure. As between the three, I would prefer the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson.</p>

Additional verbiage in a Bill of this sort will not help the objectives, which some have doubts about. Statements have been made during this debate which one must query.

Man has been doing all sorts of things over a very long period of time. Nature is actually very clever, because in many instances, it manages to undo the damage that has been done by man. But on that point alone it is being claimed that global warming is due to man-made activity. I do not necessarily dispute that, but the approach that this House and others are taking to rectifying that position is, if I might say so, quite absurd. They are blaming man for increases in temperature, yet they are quite happy to see the world&#146;s population rise from 6 billion at present to 9 billion in 2050, so that the contribution of man could increase by 50 per cent.

They are not doing that, and that is not what they are expected to do. In fact, every country in the world desperately wants to increase production year by year. That really is quite ridiculous and it cannot happen. If you believe that man&#146;s activity will cause this huge climate change, you have to do something realistic about it and not just play with the problem; that is what we are doing in this Bill. I have to say that. After all, we make a contribution of only 2 per cent to CO2 emissions, so what we can do, except give a lead, is very limited. If the country and the world want to deal with the problem realistically, they have to make some very difficult and very serious decisions.</p>

They will want to know what we were seeking to deal with when we set out. That has been made clear; all the evidence that we have received has shown that carbon emissions are leading to global warming, and that is what we are seeking to address.

That is why I believe we are right to debate these proposals at the beginning of the Bill.</p>

I am not able to do that today, for reasons that I will explain.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="07121139000139">I agree with my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis about purposes and objectives. No one has mentioned the central duty of the Bill, which is clearly set out in Clause 1&#151;to reduce the UK&#146;s net carbon account by a certain figure by a certain date. It is clear, unambiguous, and one cannot avoid understanding the meaning. The UK remains committed to the European Union&#146;s 2 degree target, but there is no simple relationship between that target and the UK&#146;s 2050 target, which is why we oppose the amendments.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="07121139000140">The increase in global average temperatures will be determined by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. There is significant uncertainty in the relationship, which is why bodies such as the IPCC use a range of probability to reflect the current level of scientific understanding. It is not clear how the amendments address that uncertainty. In addition, the science is clear that the UK cannot operate alone. We are responsible for only 2 per cent of emissions. People will argue that as it is only 2 per cent why are we bothering? The point is that we want to give a lead. We cannot achieve the 2 degree target on our own. That is clearly impossible.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="07121139000141">At the moment, reaching the 2 degree target referred to by several noble Lords depends on atmospheric concentrations, and there is a degree of uncertainty. For instance, if atmospheric concentrations of the gases reach around 450 parts per million, it is estimated that there will be around a 50 per cent chance of exceeding the 2 degree temperature increase. It is likely that we will need global emissions to peak in the next 10 to 15 years and for global greenhouse gas emissions to reduce by at least 50 per cent by 2050 on 1990 levels. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are already at 430 parts per million in a CO2 equivalent, and rising at more than 2 parts per million per year. Even if global emissions stopped today, there is around a 30 to 40 per cent chance of exceeding that 2 degree target.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="07121139000142">Not accepting the new clause is not to shirk our responsibilities. We recognise that developed countries such as the UK must take a lead in reducing emissions. That was the agreed principle of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is why we have set ambitious targets through the Bill, and why we will be asking the independent Committee on Climate Change to review whether the targets should be tightened further. It is clear that the world will tackle climate change only if we take urgent and ambitious action together. That is why we are introducing the Bill in the first place; we need not apologise for that. To people living in other countries that will probably be damaged far more than the UK, we can proudly say what we are doing through the Bill; it is clear in the Long Title and Clause 1. It is also why we are working hard at international negotiations, including currently at Bali, where the Secretary of State and the team are to launch the negotiations for the post-2012 framework.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="07121139000143">The amendments do not capture that important element of the UK&#146;s efforts to tackle global climate change. In addition, significant uncertainties arise from the amendments&#151;I am not nit-picking, but they seek to change primary legislation although I realise that they are in some ways probing&#151;around, for instance, the concept of the UK&#146;s fair share or how we will assess the UK emissions necessary to contribute to a particular level of global temperature. We think it better that there is a clear objective such as the 2050 target&#151;a short number of words set out in the first part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="07121139000144">I sympathise with the right reverend Prelate&#146;s efforts to tease out the uncertainties in the relationship, but I am afraid that we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 3, 11A and 14 at this point. The proposals risk cutting across the review of the 2050 target which the Committee on Climate Change will carry out. The review will consider the scientific developments since the royal commission&#146;s report in 2000; I fully accept that it was a long time ago and that things have changed, but that is what we are putting the Committee on Climate Change together for. The committee also has to take account of the wider international context. Amendment No. 3 also risks cutting across the UK&#146;s efforts to secure international consensus. It would determine the UK&#146;s &#147;fair share&#148; of global emissions to 2050 on the basis of the approach known as contraction and convergence, in the absence of international agreement on a different way of allocating the emissions between countries. As your Lordships will be aware, the long-term goal of guiding global action on climate change and how it should be allocated between countries is the subject of complex and delicate international negotiations. It is not a simple question; I am not saying that in a pejorative sense.</p>

<a name="71211-0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="07121139000145">The contraction and convergence approach has some attractions, in that it identifies a fixed level of stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations, and that it is based on the idea of comprehensive global participation. However, one key element of any future regime has to be its workability. One concern with contraction and convergence is how globally acceptable, and in consequence how workable, it will prove. A number of other approaches to determine a fair and equitable share are being discussed at international level. Given that there is some way to go in building the consensus within the international community that would be required to agree on a framework for a way forward, it would be premature for the UK Government to commit themselves in law to any framework at this stage. By nailing our colours so firmly to the mast in favour of one approach, we risk undermining our ability to persuade international partners to sign up to any workable approach commensurate with the scale of the challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="07121139000146">Amendments Nos. 49 and 142 relate to carbon budgets.

I have not said anything that contradicts it; the basis is exactly the same as when it started. As I said, these targets were set some time ago. One of the reasons that the Committee on Climate Change is being put together to review this is to bring the up-to-date science forward so that the Government can make the decisions, with the approval of both Houses. In other words, it is not fixed; otherwise we would not need the Committee on Climate Change. We would be relying on the science of some years ago and targets set more than seven years ago. We are accepting that the science has moved. That is implied, if I have not spelt it out sufficiently&#151;the Government do not seek to gainsay it at all. It is just that the process we have arrived at, in bringing a plan to Parliament, gives us the flexibility&#151;which we will discuss in later clauses&#151;to make the adjustments necessary to take account of the science. I suspect that the science will move in coming years also.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="07121139000150">As I have said, we have already announced that we will ask the committee to review the 2050 target and report on whether it should be tightened up to 80 per cent. In this review, the committee will need to look at all the evidence and provide its advice on the appropriate level of the target. It will, of course, include all the scientific developments, nationally and internationally, since the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#146;s report in June 2000. The committee&#146;s review of that 2050 target is the appropriate place to look at this kind of question.</p>

We will know about the functions and powers of the committee if they change as they go through Parliament. By the time we get to Report and Third Reading we will have an idea of the membership, background and calibre of the committee, so that the House can be assured&#151;or otherwise, as the case may be&#151;of what it wants to do about reinforcing the Bill.

Can the Minister give me an assurance that the major framework in which we are trying to debate these things will be reflected at the outset of the Bill as it is finally brought to us? That would give many of us in your Lordships&#146; House confidence that these issues were not just seen as isolated environmental issues but had to do with finance, defence, globalisation and the security and peace of the world as well.

I can assure the right reverend Prelate that while Defra is in the lead&#151;some department has to manage it&#151;the whole of Whitehall is engaged in the Bill. Whitehall is more engaged than it would have been if the Bill had started in the other place because it has received the distilled results and consequences of the Second Reading in your Lordships' House; and the message has gone around that in the Lords this will not wash as it is now. Therefore, some aspects put forward by Members of the Committee will require more flexibility. All the departments mentioned by the right reverend Prelate and others are actively engaged with the Bill team, which is Whitehall-wide, on what we need to do to secure a Bill with which we can all be satisfied. The Committee stage notwithstanding, early in the new year, at Report stage, there will be opportunities to look at what we do with the Bill, including the structure of the Committee on Climate Change, to see whether the House thinks that the Government have got this right.</p>

I am sympathetic with the many Members of the Committee who spoke about the habit of statisticians who talk about great accuracy in statistics when there is none. There is considerable research about these temperatures and there is sufficient evidence on which we can rely.  Our own Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology&#146;s publication on climate change science states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"><a name="07121139000208">&#147;Over the last 100 years the global mean surface temperature has warmed 0.74<sup>o</sup>C ±<sup></sup>0.18<sup>o</sup>C, although there is significant regional variability&#148;.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
 &#147;The first ever Children&#146;s Plan, which we are publishing today, follows months of consultation with parents, teachers, professionals, and children and young people themselves, up and down the country.&#147;Over the last 10 years, the lives of children have improved. School standards are up and child poverty is down, while we have many more outstanding schools and many fewer failing schools. However, following our detailed consultations, the results of which I have laid before the House, I have concluded that we need further reforms to deliver a world-class education for every child; that we must do more to prevent children falling behind or failing to fulfil their potential because of learning difficulties, poverty or disadvantage; and that, while there are more opportunities for young people today than ever before, families want more help to manage the new pressures that they face in balancing work and family life, in dealing with the internet and modern commercialism and in letting children play while staying safe. &#147;The Children&#146;s Plan is our response. First,  Mr Speaker, there are new measures to support the learning of every child. The early years are critical. So as we raise the entitlement to free nursery care for all three and four year-olds from 12 to 15 hours, we will now allocate over &#163;200 million over the next three years to ensure that young children get the highest-quality care in their early years, with at least two graduates in nurseries in the most disadvantaged areas, and we will extend the offer of free nursery places to 20,000 two year-olds in the most disadvantaged communities. &#147;School standards are rising, but I want to accelerate the improvement. I have therefore asked Sir Jim Rose to undertake a root-and-branch review of the primary curriculum to create more space for teaching the basics&#151;English and maths, with a foreign language in all primary schools&#151;and to ensure that all children start secondary school with the personal skills to succeed. If our <I>Making Good Progress</I> trials are successful, we will implement &#145;stage not age&#146; testing nationally&#151;the biggest reform to national curriculum assessment since its creation.

In future, every parent will have a record of their child&#146;s development and education through the early years and into primary school, and the Minister for Schools will consult parents and schools over the next few months, and legislate if necessary, to ensure that every child has a personal tutor who stays with them as they progress through secondary school; every parent receives up-to-date information about their child&#146;s progress, attendance and behaviour, using &#145;real time&#146; reporting and new technologies such as mobile phones or the internet; and, so that parents know what they can expect, how they will be consulted and how they can express concerns and complaints, every secondary school will have a parents&#146; council. &#147;Parents also want earlier intervention if their child falls behind. Alongside one-to-one support for reading and maths at primary school and our new Every Child a Writer programme, I am allocating &#163;18 million over the next three years to improve initial teacher training about special educational needs and to find new ways of identifying dyslexia earlier. Following the Bercow review, Ofsted will lead a full review into our special education needs provision in 2009.&#147;In our consultation, head teachers told us that schools need more support from other services to tackle all barriers to learning. Today, one in 10 children has a diagnosed mental health problem, but schools repeatedly say how hard it is to get the CAMHS children&#146;s mental health service to engage with them early enough. So I have agreed with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health that we will launch a review of CAMHS to investigate how it can work better with schools and to identify where early support is most needed. Our two departments will also produce the first ever child health strategy in the spring.&#147;We will also enhance inspection across schools and children&#146;s services and examine whether children&#146;s trusts arrangements need to be strengthened, including through further legislation if necessary. To further improve services for parents and to enable better early intervention, we will publish new guidance for Building Schools for the Future to ensure that, where possible, schools are designed with other services&#151;health, police, social care, advice and welfare services&#151;collocated with them. Because schools must be sustainable for our children and their children, we will now set a new ambition that all new schools will be zero-carbon by 2016. &#147;With the reforms that I have announced to the House to tackle failing and coasting schools, to expand the academies and trusts programme, to raise the education leaving age to 18 and to introduce

We have given teachers new powers to tackle bad behaviour and 97 per cent of schools are now in behaviour partnerships, co-ordinating behaviour and exclusions policy, which Sir Alan Steer&#146;s report recommended should include all schools by 2008. I am minded to implement that recommendation and I am now asking Sir Alan to assess progress on all his proposals and to make recommendations in the spring. We will also strengthen the regulation of pupil referral units, improve the quality of provision and pilot a range of alternatives, including this being one role for studio schools.&#147;To break cycles of reoffending among young people, the Home Secretary and I are together allocating &#163;66 million over the next three years to target support at young people most at risk of getting into crime. As we prepare our youth crime action plan, we will reform the education and resettlement of young offenders and pilot the use of restorative justice from April 2008. &#147;Our consultation reports that, although parents are clear that it is their job to bring up their families, they want more information and support to help them to keep their children safe and healthy. Our Children&#146;s Plan includes provision of &#163;167 million over the next three years to fund two new expert parenting advisers in every local authority area, expand family learning, support young carers and deliver new support for families with disabled children. &#147;Dr Tanya Byron is investigating the potential risks to children from harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games and will report next March. In the spring, we will make proposals on young people and alcohol and investigate how the huge increase in commercial activity, advertising and marketing aimed specifically at children and young people is affecting their well-being.&#147;I have two further announcements. In our consultation, children and young people told us that they want more places in which to play and interesting things to do outside school and that they want to be recognised for their achievements.&#147;Earlier this year, the Minister for Children set out our 10-year strategy for young people, with an ambition of new youth facilities and places for young people to go in every constituency of the country, funded by proceeds from unclaimed assets and new investment from my department. However, I want us to start transforming youth services now. So, prior to the unclaimed assets legislation taking effect, we will invest an additional &#163;160 million over the next two years to develop high-quality youth facilities for young people, shaped by young people themselves. This could mean 50 new state-of-the-art youth centres, 500 refurbished youth centres or more than 2,000 smaller-scale centres, including

The funding will be available for every part of the country starting in April and I urge all honourable Members to start working with young people, the voluntary sector and their local community to draw up local plans.&#147;Finally, to help parents to keep their children safe while they are playing outside, I can also announce that we will launch a new national play strategy early next year. To make this a reality, and starting next April, we will build 30 safe and supervised adventure play parks in disadvantaged areas. With a total investment of &#163;225 million over the next three years, we will also be able to build or upgrade more than 3,500 play areas across the country&#151;an average of 23 per local authority and seven per constituency, the largest government investment in children&#146;s play in our history.&#147;With schools, children&#146;s services, the voluntary sector and the Government all playing their full part and meeting their responsibilities, and with the &#163;1 billion over the next three years that we are allocating to meet our Children&#146;s Plan commitments, we can unlock the talents and promote the health and happiness of all children, and not just some; back parents as they meet their responsibilities to bring up their children; and intervene early so that no child or young person is left to fall behind. Making our country the best place in the world for children to grow up is the mission of this Government and of this Children&#146;s Plan&#148;.

We have been strong advocates over the years of much of what this wide-reaching programme seeks to deliver. We have studied many of the issues in our own childhood review, which we completed earlier this year. As my honourable friend Michael Gove said, improving children&#146;s lives and closing the gap between rich and poor are vital. Therefore, there are elements of the plan that we welcome. However, if we really want to engage with parents and if we want higher standards so that our children can reach their full potential, we have to recognise that some of the plan&#146;s recommendations are gimmicky and demonstrate poverty of aspiration.</p>

That is why we supported the Government over the Childcare Bill last year and why we appreciate the extension of free entitlement to the most underprivileged two year-olds. However, we have some concerns and some questions.</p>

<a name="71211-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="07121139000172">I am sure that the Minister would agree that Sure Start has disappointed in many areas and has failed to reach the very children whom it was designed to help. How will this improve for two year-olds? Has there been an impact assessment on how it will affect the private and voluntary sector providers? The establishment of free provision for three year-olds and four year-olds was a destabilising factor. If the Government are genuine about wishing to work with the private and voluntary sectors, this is a vital issue.</p>

<a name="71211-0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="07121139000173">Another concern is that what is right for a child of two years and, say, eight months may not be right for a child who has just turned two, especially in areas such as attachment. Once again, I want to raise our worries over the early years foundation stage, about which experts and parents alike now question whether the Government know what is best for children. Where is the room for different approaches?</p>

<a name="71211-0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="07121139000174">I welcome the commitment to a review of CAMHS and how it can work with schools but, with one in 10 of our children suffering from a diagnosed mental health problem and the poor access that so many have to CAMHS, this review is long overdue. We also welcome the extra help for disabled children.</p>

<a name="71211-0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="07121139000175">Our main concerns with this plan concern education. The 10-year plan comes only three and a half years after the <I>Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners</I>, which heralded reform and ambitious targets to be reached by 2008. We were told by the Government that they would have,</p>
<ul><a name="07121139000209">&#147;reached and sustained our literacy and numeracy targets of 85 percent of children reaching the expected level at the age of 11&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121139000176">The reality is that this target was missed and has now been dropped in favour of a target of 78 per cent of pupils reaching the required level by 2011. This is set against a background of the recent PIRLS study, which showed that since 2001 England had plummeted from third to 19th in the international reading literacy table with only Morocco and Romania seeing sharper declines. Is the Minister happy that by setting a target of 78 per cent of pupils reaching the expected level, the Government are effectively saying to two out of every 10 parents that they are prepared to see their children fail?</p>

<a name="71211-0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="07121139000177">The Government have said that they wish to include parents more in the education of their children. Who could disagree with that? One of the ways in which they envisage doing that is through regular e-mail contact, which is fine as far as it goes, but it is not the answer to failing standards. The single most important way to get parents involved is to give them real power; that is, the power to take their child out of a failing school and into a school of their choice, so that schools are properly accountable to parents. In 2005-06, 79,000 appeals were made against school place allocations; 58,000 failed and those children ended up in schools to which their parents did not want them to go. What makes it worse is that

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="07121139000179">We all want the best for our children and yet the Children&#146;s Society found in its excellent work on childhood that the most important area for children was a happy home life where they spent time together as part of a family, an area not mentioned today. I worry that the Government have sent so many confusing messages to parents that either parents are scared of doing things in case they do the wrong thing or they feel that they need not bother because the state is doing it all. We should be empowering parents to help to unlock their children&#146;s talents and we should be very careful not to stand in their shoes.</p>

I regret the fact that we do not have the original Spice Girl on our Benches but I bet you we have a Scary, a Posh and&#151;what are the other ones? We certainly have a Sporty. In this House we do less political grandstanding and more scrutiny and I intend to focus very carefully on the Statement and ask quite a lot of questions. If I ask for further clarification that does not mean that we do not welcome every single extra pound, or particularly every million pounds that the Government are going to spend on children, and the additional focus and outside expertise that the Government are bringing in to inform their policy-making. That we all welcome. In general, though, top-down policies will not work and so some of my questions will be to find out how much is being decided locally and how much is being determined by the Government from Whitehall.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="07121139000181">I agree with the Minister that the early years are critical. We welcome that the Government are providing enough money for at least two graduates in nurseries in the most disadvantaged areas but will the Minister confirm that the Government will not specify how many graduates will have to be provided? That should be for local decision-making. I also welcome the extra nursery places for another 20,000 two year-olds but, as my honourable friend David Laws in another place said, one must put that in the context of there being 650,000 children in that age group. How is this going to be done? A two year-old is very close to its parent and should be. The Government run the risk of being called a nanny state if nursery provision says, &#147;We are going to take your children away from you at the age of two. We know better how to do it&#148;. Perhaps the Minister could say a little more about how the parents of two year-olds will be involved in helping children to develop with expert advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="07121139000182">I, too, question the need for another root and branch review of the primary curriculum and wonder what the Minister envisages being taken out in order to allow more space for teaching the basics. Children already spend over 50 per cent of their time on English and maths. I welcome the concentration on personal and social education but I have some concerns about the evaluation of the SEAL programme and whether the teachers doing that evaluation are actually best equipped to do it. Does the Minister agree that before reading, the child must develop adequate listening and speaking skills? Parents play a crucial role in language development so can we not include that as a priority for all health visitors and in all government-sponsored parenting programmes? I agree with the Minister that partnership and multidisciplinary working are crucial to early identification and intervention, but the training stage of all professionals is the most appropriate time for the Government to intervene. Ministers should ensure that professionals who work with children are trained to understand other professionals&#146; areas and how and when to bring them into play to work with them, and not take over the decisions that those professionals should be taking themselves.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="07121139000183">What are the Government doing about this? Speech and language fall between health and education, and although it is great to hear that the Minister is working with his counterpart in health, what in the plan will support the estimated 1.2 million children who have a communication disability, particularly the 50 per cent of children in some parts of the UK who are arriving at primary school without the speech and language skills required to learn? This involves people working together. That is why I welcome what the Minister said about the Building Schools for the Future programme, as it is quite certain from my visits to certain special schools that the collocation of professionals really helps them in multidisciplinary working. I certainly welcome the &#163;18 million that the Minister has announced for initial teacher training in special educational needs, but what about continuous professional development for existing staff? Most members of the teaching workface are already in work. Will the Minister say what will be done about them? The review into special educational needs provision, which the Minister mentioned, will undoubtedly discover that there are major unmet needs. Will he commit to funding for the needs that are discovered?</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="07121139000184">I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about the problem with CAMHS. The Minister said that the Government will investigate how they can work better with schools to identify where early support is most needed, but does he not recognise that quantity and quality also need to be considered to fulfil the need for CAMHS treatment? Can he give us a little more detail about the Children&#146;s Trust arrangements that he envisaged, which may need to be strengthened through legislation? On the powers to tackle bad behaviour, will the Minister confirm that the Government will concentrate on the positive activities in Sir Alan Steer&#146;s report and not concentrate simply on the punitive in relation to children&#146;s behaviour?</p>

I sense that they are both trying to set themselves up as the Spice Baronesses. I shall not volunteer them for particular roles in that regard, but I am sure that Members of the House will be glad to take offers. We could even set up an adjudication panel for later, as I sense that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, in particular is keen to steal my right honourable friend&#146;s limelight, and perhaps even the limelight of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, whom we are sad not to see in her place this afternoon.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="07121139000187">As I said, I was particularly glad that the two noble Baronesses supported the broad thrust of the Children&#146;s Plan: the importance of improving children&#146;s lives; the importance of supporting parents&#151;although we recognise that the prime responsibility for bringing up children must of course reside with the parents, who need help, information and support, and parents in more deprived circumstances need a great deal more support than others; and the importance of narrowing the gap between the affluent and the poor. The latter has been a consistent strand of government policy in the past 10 years, and we need to take that further forward.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="07121139000188">The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, was in acute danger of becoming party political in a less productive sense when she said that the proposals were gimmicky or lacking in ambition in many places. I was not quite sure which proposals she thought were gimmicky or lacking in ambition. Did she think that the 3,000 new or upgraded play centres are gimmicky or lacking in ambition, or the &#163;160 million spent on new facilities, the expert parent advisers in every local authority area, the 20,000 new nursery places for two year-olds in disadvantaged areas, the expansion of short breaks for the parents of disabled children, the new masters qualification for all new teachers or the ITT training for teachers in special educational needs? I could go on. There is nothing gimmicky or lacking in ambition in the Children's Plan. It is a whole set of interlocking measures that will substantially improve the support available to parents and schools in the raising of children. I look forward to her support on the specific measures as we roll them out.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="07121139000189">The noble Baroness asked a whole series of questions about schools and I will address myself particularly to those because, as Minister for Schools, they are causes that are within my own direct area of responsibility. She asked me straight out whether we were happy that, among 11 year-olds, two out of 10 of them are not up to the standard expected of their age in literacy and numeracy. I tell her absolutely straightforwardly that we are not happy with that situation. The number and proportion of 11 year-olds

There are  now 100,000 more 11 year-olds reaching level 4 in English than was the case 10 years ago, which is a 17 percentage point improvement.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="07121139000190">We have seen significant improvements, but we are not satisfied with the status quo and we wish to see it improve further. That is why, for example, two years ago we appointed the Rose review. Sir Jim Rose recommended to us that best practice in the teaching of reading included much more systematic use of synthetic phonics. We are in the process of implementing that recommendation at the moment. The new letters and sounds materials, which exemplify Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations, have gone out to every primary school in the country. We have changed the national curriculum to give primacy to synthetic phonics, and Sir Jim Rose himself, who is an acknowledged expert in the whole area of the primary curriculum, is leading the primary curriculum review that we announced today.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="07121139000191">Sir Peter Williams, an eminent mathematician, is leading the review into mathematics teaching, which will also report in the spring, to see how we can improve the quality of teaching in that area. Therefore, I do not believe that we have been slow in taking forward the measures that are necessary to reach those two in 10 who have not been achieving the level expected of their age in literacy and numeracy.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="07121139000192">In respect of failing and successful schools, where the noble Baroness raised the issue of too many schools underperforming, here again there has been a substantial improvement over the past 10 years. The number of seriously underperforming schools below the 25 per cent baseline figure of five or more good GCSEs has fallen from more than 600 in 1997 to less than 30 this year. We actually raised the baseline targets that we set to 30 per cent including English and maths, so we are much more ambitious for our schools as a whole. The number of successful schools is therefore improving.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="07121139000193">We have been very robust in the setting up of new schools in areas where the schools are not good enough at the moment. We debated that at length last week when I set out the progress that we are making in the improvement of underperforming schools and in the establishment of new academies, of which I know that the noble Baroness has been supportive. I do not believe that we are lacking ambition at all in this area. Our ambition is that every community in the country should have outstanding primary and secondary schools and that every parent should have the opportunity to choose a good school for their child. That led us to take some radical and controversial decisions about school organisation, which we have debated in the past two years, to make that possible. It is also backed up by a capital programme for schools now running at &#163;6 billion a year up from a capital programme of barely &#163;600 million a year 10 years ago. Therefore, the investment necessary to create these new schools is also there and that is making possible the reforms that are described.</p>

Collocation and promoting proposals for collocation are at the heart of the Building Schools for the Future programme. Area by area, as BSF is being rolled out, proposals are coming forward for the enhancement of special educational needs provision in mainstream schools with, for example, the building of dedicated units in particular areas of special educational need but also for the collocation of special schools with mainstream schools so that the expertise can be shared between the two institutions.</p>
This is a central theme of BSF.

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="07121139000195">The noble Baroness asked about the 20,000 places we are providing for two year-olds and how these would be selected. Let me make it absolutely clear that this will be done only with the consent of parents; it will be parent-led. We will not be seeking to oblige children to spend time in nursery classes at the age of two without their parents&#146; consent. Of course, as an increasing proportion of parents now develop strong links with their children&#146;s centres from the birth of their children, we expect there to be demand to increase that number over time, and to have no difficulty in filling the places.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="07121139000196">The noble Baroness asked about the two parenting advisers planned for each area. We see health visitors as having a role in the provision of these parenting advisers, but do not believe that they will all be health visitors. We will seek a balanced recruitment of professionals who offer expertise in this area. On the review of special educational needs, we will seek to meet unmet needs. I should flag up that, for example, we have announced &#163;330 million of extra provision for disabled young children, including a big national scheme for short breaks, so we are investing significantly in this area. Communications weaknesses and difficulties among children need addressing. We have the Bercow review; we will look at whether additional investment is needed in this area.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="07121139000197">The behaviour partnerships referred to in the Statement are not punitive at all. Their main focus is to see that there is proper provision in each area, through co-operative activity between schools, for children who are excluded from school, so that they are not out of the system. The schools themselves may, perfectly appropriately, have had to exclude pupils in certain instances, but should then make collective provision for them. This is much better than the existing provision, and will both enhance the quality of their education and make it easier to reintegrate the children afterwards. I hope that that answers most of the questions, but I will respond in writing to the others.</p>

<p><a name="07121147000004">That is a great objective, but it is a long-term objective&#151;a 10-year objective for progress. Our most valuable service to education will be to reach a consensus on the way forward. An election is not far off. Schools will value us more if we can reach a consensus on these issues. As for the general thrust, I have not had time to study the plan in detail, but I very much welcome the emphasis placed on helping those who need the most help in education. Without that help, we are heading for the most serious social problems, which are bad enough already. We will reap the whirlwind unless we implement the kind of measures that we see here.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="07121147000005">I want to make three points in detail; I will be brief about it. First, I notice with pleasure, echoing the Prime Minister&#146;s words in his speech to the merchants and bankers of the City of London in the summer, that a foreign language is placed alongside English and maths as a basic. That is a major statement. I look forward to seeing the work that Jim Rose will do on how to implement this. I hope very much that the Government can implement it in September 2010, as recommended in the report to which I was party.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="07121147000006">Secondly, taking the test when one is ready would mean that some key stage 2 children would take it after progression to secondary school. That will make sense only if they get real help to advance well and real support to reach the standard that is expected of them. The whole point is to identify and to give help. I hope that the Government will commit to that.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="07121147000007">Thirdly, in paragraph 3.129, which deals with helping summer-born children, one sentence puzzles me:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"><a name="07121147000088">&#147;Research evidence suggests that allowing all children in the year group to begin at the same time (the September of the year they turn 5) has the most positive impact as it allows summer-born children to receive the same amount of full-time schooling as their peers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121147000008">I cannot see why, if these children defer a year, they should not nevertheless get the same schooling as other children. They do not have to leave school early; they can have their full ration. I am not trying to argue with the policy. I particularly welcome the proposal that Sir Jim Rose should look into this, but that one sentence puzzles me.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="07121147000009">Generally speaking, I wish this well. I hope that we will get into the detail at a later stage and make it something that will command respect and support across the House.</p>

His excitement at the prospect of not having to conduct another review is palpable. However, the plan takes forward the recommendations of his last important review on the teaching of modern foreign languages. As he rightly says, how the teaching of modern foreign languages is provided for in primary schools will be a key feature of Sir Jim Rose&#146;s review. We will look to see how we can implement the commitment that we gave in the primary review that we would seek to make the teaching of modern foreign languages mandatory in primary schools.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="07121147000011">In respect of summer-born children, which is becoming a constant theme of the noble Lord&#146;s interventions, he is right that paragraph 3.129 of the plan mentions the positive impact of allowing summer-born children to receive the same amount of full-time schooling as their peers, but I am glad to say that it is followed by paragraph 3.130, which states that Sir Jim Rose will consider this issue and, in particular,</p>
<ul><a name="07121147000096">&#147;whether it would be appropriate to allow greater flexibility in start dates&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121147000082">I encourage the noble Lord to speak to Sir Jim Rose directly about this, because there are not many people in the country who know more about it than he does. He and a group of researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies are serious experts on this issue, but there are not many others. I am sure that he and the noble Lord would have a productive conversation.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="07121147000012">As regards pupils sitting tests when they are ready rather than on the set dates regardless of readiness, the noble Lord is right that such a step would require substantial and proper support. Big issues are raised about how it would be implemented in practice. That is why we are piloting single-level tests sat at two points in the year, with teachers entering pupils for them when they believe that the children are ready. This pilot is taking place in more than 400 schools and we intend to evaluate the results before we make firm commitments on how we proceed.</p>

This is a case very much of a yes but one or two buts. I wish to make three points. First, the curriculum needs to be looked at. However, as the parent of two teachers, I can hear them groaning in the distance, &#147;More change. Where is the stability?&#148;. What about the Cambridge-led review of testing on which the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked an Oral Question two weeks ago? I should register what we all know to be the case: that it will be mighty difficult  to win over many teachers to a complete overhaul of the curriculum, even though parts of it need to be looked at.</p>

<a name="71211-0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="07121147000014">My second point concerns that big word &#147;resources&#148;. I suppose that in broad terms these Benches represent the voluntary sector, or part of the voluntary sector. We all know that to put right what is amiss in childhood will be a long haul, not a quick fix. In some other areas, although not necessarily in education, the Government have a habit of throwing money at the community. I refer to the National Health Service as, I hope, an ex-patient. In the National Heath Service you will come across areas where lots of money is spent, and overspent, but other areas where it is underspent. That leads me to emphasise that the voluntary sector is increasingly under pressure as things are devolved to it that the statutory bodies can no longer afford to carry out. What about these drop-in centres that we hear about? Research has been carried out on parents whose experience of education has not been favourable. How will they take to these drop-in centres?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="07121147000015">My final point brings us back to one made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about family life. This  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is a minefield, but it is important. Right next to our house in Fareham, there is a lollypop lady, to whom I am married. She functions twice a day and I sometimes look at her clientele. We need to redefine family in terms of the extended family. It is very often grandparents who are doing the ferrying because parents are working. We all know that there are other more radical ways in which the family can be redefined, in terms of gender and so on. However, I want the importance of the family to be underlined. Perhaps, in the past, the church has overemphasised the family. I know that family life is not for everyone and that families can destroy people, but it is important that we underline and recognise the centrality of the family in society.</p>

<p><a name="st_108">
<a name="07121147000016"><b><a name="71211-0006.htm_spnew0"><a name="07121147000105">Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, I greatly welcome and agree entirely with the right reverend Prelate&#146;s remarks about the importance of both the family and the voluntary sector and about seeing that the latter is able to access new resources on a level playing field, which we are anxious that it should do. I also agree with his remarks about the curriculum. He is quite right that one needs to combine necessary stability with review of areas that need to change. I assure him that that will be the case, because the person whom we have appointed to conduct the review is Sir Jim Rose, who led the review on the teaching of reading two years ago and who is an expert adviser to Sir Peter Williams&#146;s review on the teaching of mathematics in primary school; he is a long-standing expert on primary education, as the right reverend Prelate knows. With his wisdom being brought to bear on the review, there is no danger of our introducing policies that do not have a necessary degree of continuity with other recent changes to the primary curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="st_109">
<a name="07121147000017"><b><a name="71211-0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="07121147000106">Baroness Morris of Yardley:</b> My Lords, I welcome the Statement today and congratulate my noble friend and his colleagues on it. The plan is ambitious. There is a welcome shift of focus from the policy that we have had in the past five years. Never have I read a Green Paper where implementation is going to be more challenging but where, if we get it right, there are real opportunities to transform life chances for the many children whom we have not succeeded with so far. A couple of things are particularly welcome. First, I very much welcome the masters degrees for those new to teaching. I would welcome further correspondence and engagement with the Minister on that. On modern foreign languages, does he envisage that this will be compulsory rather than available in the primary school curriculum? Has he made up his mind on that?</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="07121147000018">I have three genuine questions to probe a little behind the Minister&#146;s thinking. First, on testing, I am not one who thinks that primary school is overtested. One externally set test between the ages of five and 11 is not overburdensome. There is not a lot to be lost in that respect if the required grade at age 11 is not obtained. How will the proposals affect the reporting of results for parents and the wider public, so that we will be able to continue to compare school with school and to identify those schools that need extra support to raise standards? Secondly, in saying that we want to  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_148"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>find more time for English and maths in the curriculum, we must ensure that we do not give a message that the arts, creativity, sports, the humanities and the sciences are not valued between the ages of five and 11. Finally, will my noble friend give a clear message to teachers that their role remains teaching and learning in the classroom? Almost the biggest danger of this Green Paper is that teachers might choose to take on some of the wider responsibilities that ought to fall to other professionals. If we ensure that their focus continues to be on teaching and learning, with other professionals coming in behind them, that might give us the best chance of success.</p>

<p><a name="st_110">
<a name="07121147000019"><b><a name="71211-0006.htm_spnew2"><a name="07121147000107">Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend, who speaks with great authority in this area. She is right that there is a big implementation challenge with the various measures set out in the plan. We will be saying more about that over the coming months.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="07121147000020">Let me deal with the points that my noble friend raised. She is absolutely right to highlight the significance of introducing masters degrees into education in a systematic way. This is a serious process of learning from international best practice. Over recent years, I and many of my colleagues have visited Finland and other Scandinavian countries, where masters courses are widely available; indeed, in Finland, they are now generally undertaken by teachers. It is hard not to make a connection between the degree of professionalism that is brought to the training and to the updating of skills in Finland and the success that Finnish schools achieve. Although we have said that this will be in the first instance an opportunity for newly qualifying teachers, I hope that we will be in a position to extend that in due course. I am very attracted to the idea that continuing professional development, which we rightly expect of our teachers, should, where they wish it, take the form of study and project work that leads to a higher-level degree. That would also help to raise the esteem and attractiveness of the teaching profession, if we can carry it through.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="07121147000021">My noble friend is right to highlight the importance of comparable statistics on the performance of schools. I entirely agree with her comments on testing in schools; it is not overburdensome to have one externally assessed national test between the ages of five and 11. It is our intention with the new single-level tests, if they are introduced, that we will still have reporting on a comparable basis, school by school, of the proportion achieving at each of the levels. Although the pupils may sit the tests at different times and will sit the tests at single levels, rising up the levels as their capability advances, we expect to see the results reported level by level, school by school.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="07121147000022">On the curriculum, I entirely agree with her that arts, creativity, sport and humanities are all absolutely vital. In my experience, those schools that are best at teaching children the basics also tend to do best in developing the arts and creativity. Like my noble friend, I entirely reject the notion that having a solid grounding in the basics, school by school, including proper catch-up support if necessary and one-to-one support for those children who are falling behind, as  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we also highlight in the Children&#146;s Plan, is in any way antipathetic to the development of the arts, creativity, sports and the humanities, which we also want to see as a central part of the work of our primary schools.</p>

<p><a name="st_111">
<a name="07121147000023"><b><a name="71211-0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="07121147000108">Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, I am sure that we all recognise that the noble Lord has a most encouraging understanding of what goes on in schools, which must be a great encouragement to teachers. Does he realise the effect on staff of change and of sheaves of paper arriving on desks and hours spent deciding how to implement change? Can he assure us, with his understanding of these things, that the absolute maximum amount may be left to the school to decide how to implement these changes? This is a very important point. If a school decides how to implement change, it is far more enthusiastic and it will work better. I am sure that the former Secretary of State for Education, who has just spoken, would agree with that. That seems to be very important. As a small illustration of that point, there is the business of doing the right thing about carbon efficiency. If a school thinks about this, it might well decide that people will not always teach in shirt sleeves and that the temperature of the school can be reduced. If it is told to do that, it will not do it, but if it decides for itself to do it, that is a great help. That is a simple point. If the school decides how to involve parents, it would do it so much better.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="07121147000024">On youth work, it is marvellous news that the Government are at last seeing that what happened in the 1960s was helpful and that a bit more concentration on thinking about where young people go and what they do in the evenings is very important. My experience on education committees goes back a long way. I remember those great and helpful days, and a lot can be done in that direction. I hope that the Government will not feel that they have got to do this through the public sector. The right reverend Prelate reminded us&#151;and the Minister gave an encouraging reply&#151;that voluntary organisations will come into this. There is still huge expertise in the private sector in informal youth work and that expertise can be built on. Some money going in will help enormously. Relaxing how people become youth workers would also help. There is so much suspicion about what youth workers might be like that lots of people are put off. I am sure that the Minister knows that, as it is an important area.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="07121147000025">Lastly, how is this going to be paid for? Will the Minister&#146;s department have to move money out of one area and into another? Given the prognostications about the economy for the next few years, funding is going to be tight.</p>

I did not have time to respond to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. The private and voluntary sectors also play a crucial role in the provision of under-fives services. There has been some dispute about how local authorities manage that role but, local authority by local authority, the private and voluntary sectors are a key provider. We wish to see their role in under-fives provision flourish, including in the extension of provision to two year-olds that I announced in the Statement.</p>

<a name="71211-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="07121147000028">In my experience as a Minister, the attitude of schools to change and the degree of enthusiasm with which they implement it depends on whether they like the changes. Schools are not against change per se, but they want to be fully consulted and engaged in the process of change. A key point about change in the education system in recent years has been that, as in so many other areas of life, power tends to follow money. The overwhelming bulk of funding in the education system is now devolved directly to schools, thanks to changes brought about by this Government and the last Government. Comparatively little is now held by education authorities. That means that schools, head teachers, staff and governors are in a central and powerful position in determining policy on the ground, because they control the purse strings. </p>

I am sure that the Minister will say that it is the convention that securing the target and being responsible for it being met is dealt with by the Secretary of State of whichever department is in charge of the target. However, as the Minister said on the previous group of amendments, the problem is that this issue touches every department. From Defra to the Ministry of Defence, there is not a department that will not have to deal with it in a ministerial capacity, and on an individual basis, each department will have to look carefully at how it deals with its carbon allocation and reduces it.</p>

The right reverend Prelate mentioned the first carbon war, in Darfur, although some other regions have been affected. John Howard might be the first prime ministerial casualty, as the election in Australia was fought on the basis of the drought. The fundamental underlying feature of that drought was climate change, which brought about its severity. Is it conceivable that a Secretary of State&#151;at the moment, I believe that it is the Secretary of State from Defra, but the Minister can say whether it could move to another department&#151;will have the clout and ability to impose incredibly strict and harsh limits and regimes on every aspect of government and individual life? That will not be the case. The buck has to stop with the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="07121147000035">It will not be too long before each Prime Minister who comes into office will be judged to a degree by a significant proportion of the electorate on their ability to reduce carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change, which will become all too apparent for every one of us. We only have to look at the summer, when the Environment Agency became the fifth emergency service, defending infrastructure such as electricity stations, to see how each department will have to come to the fore. Of course, we have just had a Statement on schooling. I was at a meeting last night discussing the Severn barrage with a large company that deals with large contracts. The point made clearly to me was that the worst culprit of any client in thinking about mitigating the amount of carbon in any project at the moment was the Government. The cultural change has to take place from top to bottom, and only the Prime Minister can achieve that aim.</p>

Of course he is right, but the most recent figures&#151;those of 2005&#151;regarding the share of carbon emissions from each sector show that energy industries produced 37.4 per cent, road transport 21.6 per cent, other industries 17.8 per cent and residential 14.9 per cent.

Whenever I go into a school, issues about the future of the world are at the top of the agenda of the people who want to talk to me. It is not purely a local issue for them. If the Prime Minister were to acknowledge this and accept some responsibility publicly, he would score enormously highly with those teenagers who will have to live with the consequences of what we decide. They probably mind about it much more than any of the rest of us. They are invested in it in a remarkable way, both in intellectual appreciation of what must be done and their persistence in holding to account those whom they think might be able to do something about it. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, is not in his place to hear me say this. It would be an enormously important signal to the young of the country if the Prime Minister were persuaded that this was an important part of what he should personally head up.</p>

Amendments Nos. 65, 79 and 88, to which we have put our name, serve a specific purpose: to put the Prime Minister in pole position on particular issues. The first is for him to read the annual report of the Committee on Climate Change and present it to Parliament. Similarly, the final statement of the budgetary period should be presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister. The final 2050 statement should be presented by the Prime Minister to Parliament for approval. The reason behind this, as has been said by other noble Lords, is that climate change is a cross-departmental issue. It must be considered where all policy decisions are being made, not just in Defra. The brief of the Secretary of State for Defra is simply not broad enough given the magnitude of the issue. The only person whose brief cuts across all departments of state is the Prime Minister. Ultimately, his Government implement this law.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"><a name="07121147000090">&#147;Every new policy will be examined for its impact on carbon emissions&#151;not just those which reduce emissions, but those which increase them. And where emissions rise in one sector, we will have to achieve corresponding falls in another&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121147000083">That was a clear recognition of the fact that there is an inter-sectoral trade-off at the very heart of this legislation. The relationship between one department and another is critical to the Bill on an agenda which will probably dominate the next 100 years. I would have thought that any British Prime Minister would want to take on overall responsibility for seeing through this agenda, knowing that it is only the Prime Minister who can manage an inter-sectoral role interdepartmentally and also as regards wider policy governing various sectors. That paragraph of the speech continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"><a name="07121147000091">&#147;The legislation will enact our target of achieving a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 60 per cent by 2050 through domestic and international action&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121147000084">Again, inherent in that is the proposition that many of the great decisions on these issues will be taken at international conferences&#151;probably summits in the end&#151;when we hit crises. I argue that it is only a prime minister with a central co-ordinating role&#151;the important role of seeing through this policy&#151;who would have day-to-day contact with this moving agenda and would be able to represent fully the interests of the United Kingdom in those conditions.

The practical effect of the amendment is, frankly, difficult to define. In reality, the Prime Minister could delegate the duty to deal with all those things to departments, led by Defra but along with others. The whole thing is preposterous, given the staff numbers in No. 10. There is not the capacity there. No. 10 might be very large compared to previous Governments, but it is nowhere near as large as the secretariat of most departments. It is simply not resourced to carry out those matters.

I freely admit that there are parts of the Bill where we might be able to look at ways of demonstrating that the Government as a whole are committed on this issue.

The Minister has said that of course the Prime Minister will not do the work himself. I quite agree. However, we have the major problem of different departments with different objectives. A classic example was the decision for the third runway at Heathrow: DBERR&#151;or DEBRIS&#151;made one decision, about the economic impact, while Defra would make another, about whether we should build a third runway at Heathrow.

We already see this in the ETS&#151;the aviation industry is interested in signing up, because it can buy credits from other industries. The problem, taking that to its logical conclusion, is that the aviation industry would take up all the carbon units for every industry, if it carried on buying up those credits. Therefore, there would be none left for power generation or for other industries. The issue is not just presentational. If individuals write their manifestos about how they are going to run the Government in the future, they will have to make sure that every single one of the policies that they sign their parties up to meet those objectives.

As said on many occasions and by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, who chaired the Committee, this is a unique Bill. When we questioned those who gave evidence on Wednesday 16 May about this duty &#147;to ensure&#148;, we found that it is a unique clause, which has never been used in a Bill before. Mr Wilson, who is a director of Cambrensis and a barrister at its environmental law unit, told us that, in his opinion, the clause might add a little to public pressure and organise public opinion, but he went on to say that:</p>

We do not want to dilute the importance of this clause or the importance of the Bill. We want wording that is as equally strong as the word &#147;ensure&#148;, but which also enables the Secretary of State to be held to account in a proper way, rather than through just public opinion

I have talked to my noble friend Lord Crickhowell who asked me to enter my tuppence-ha&#146;pennyworth. The Secretary of State is Mr Hilary Benn. His grandfather was, I believe, Secretary of State for India in 1927. His father was a distinguished Minister in the Labour Government in the 1960s. There is an element of the fact that the Benn family are becoming hereditary Members of the House of Commons, which has an element of irony about it. I believe that Hilary Benn&#146;s son also is standing as a Member of the House of Commons, so the tradition continues.</p>

<a name="71211-0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="07121157000002">I suppose that it is possible that a Mr Benn&#151;or perhaps a right honourable Lord Stansgate KCMG or something&#151;will be Prime Minister at the time that this duty is imposed on the Secretary of State. Those are probably the unique circumstances in which someone could be held responsible in 2050 for actions taken by others between now and then. For the sake of argument, let us assume that this passion for wind power turns out to be what a lot of the wind power sceptics say that it will be in not reducing CO2 emissions. I believe that there is recent evidence of that in Denmark. We know that wind power cannot be used all the time because either the wind is too strong or too weak. Consequently, it has to be backed up with other forms of electricity generation.</p>

<a name="71211-0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="07121157000003">If the policies adopted by the present Mr Benn as Secretary of State are the wrong policies, and they do not affect CO2 in the way which we all wish and all know to be quintessentially essential, how can  Mr Benn junior&#151;probably the present Mr Benn&#146;s great-grandson&#151;or whoever is Secretary of State in 2050 be held responsible? Of course, we should have something of planning in the Bill. This goes a long way towards it. Perhaps it would be better to have a declaratory clause. I know that modern legislators do not like them, but they have been present in other legislation. I have been trying to show the difficulty and illogicality of putting this wording in the Bill. I therefore support this amendment completely.</p>

I was nodding in agreement because we have collective government in this country: we have Cabinet government. The Bill states:</p>

<p><a name="07121157000065">so that it is 60 per cent lower. But, as the Bill is worded, the Secretary of State is put in an impossible position. He or she will not know what their successors will do. Far from offering any radical change to the nature of the Bill, the amendment puts into common sense the position of a Minister, as my noble friend has argued.</p>

In the other place, I was involved, as I am sure was the noble Lord, in taking tours around the Aye and No lobbies. In one of the lobbies one can see the legislation that has been passed. I was always rather embarrassed that there were far more shelves for the period when we were in office, never mind for the modern period, than for the previous 150 years. I repudiate the idea of using legislation to make a point, to highlight an issue or to set a target. I worry that this no doubt well intended Bill is being used for this purpose, which does not seem to me to be a proper purpose. The first line of the Bill falls down in that respect and the amendment does much to improve it.</p>

The building of the British Library took only 20 years and not the 43 years for which we are legislating. But there were a number of Secretaries of State during the building of the British Library and I was one of them. In 1994, when it had been 16 years in the building, I was summoned before Mr Kaufman&#146;s Select Committee. About two-thirds of the way through the committee, after a great deal of evidence had been considered, Mr Kaufman said, &#147;Now, Secretary of State, we really must come to a conclusion. This is a very bad business. Who is responsible?&#148;. I knew perfectly well that if I said anything other than, &#147;Mr Kaufman, you know perfectly well where the responsibility lies: the Secretary of State is responsible and, therefore, I am&#148;, the hearing would go on for at least another three-quarters of an hour beyond the time that was set for us to finish it.

I say to my noble friend Lord Onslow that the consequence of that particular remark was that, when Her Majesty the Queen opened the British Library in 1998, we had achieved it before the end of the century and I was in the happy but wholly accidental position of taking the credit for achieving what was in fact a miracle. The fact remains that although I said what I did in 1994, it is difficult to see how the Secretary of State at a particular moment is responsible for the whole 20-year span of the business.

There would have to be something more than the present participation of emerging economies such as India and China under the Kyoto treaty joint initiative.

It seems to have been thought that the intention of the amendment was to address the perceived lack of enforceability of this requirement or duty to meet the targets and budgets in the Bill. It was not drafted for that purpose, as I said, probably inadequately, on Second Reading, and as was alluded to by the noble Earl&#151;although I thought as he sat down that he was making the opposite point from the same information.</p>

I cannot say that I agree with them but examples were given of different departments&#146; attitudes to energy generation and transport, as though the departments were fiefdoms in their own right, quite independent of Government and with their own messages.

We believe&#151;and I stand to be corrected on this by lawyers&#151;that the amendment would in practice weaken the duty on the Secretary of State. If you focus on the process, it would be possible to do your best, stay within the budget and end up complying with the duty because you thought it was the right policy.

Had we passed a law that said that it was the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce the amount taken by the state in taxation, I doubt very much that it would have influenced future Governments. This is declaratory legislation, and placing such a duty on a Secretary of State or a Chancellor, who might be faced by a change in economic conditions or a shock, might put him in conflict with his other duties and it may be impossible for him to achieve it.

I was constrained from commenting on everyone&#146;s speech at the time, but I thought that his speech was a little more revolutionary than he actually thought. He gave some examples, which I thought were quite practical, of what would happen in the future and he talked about the need for change. He approached the matter from a different direction, but I respected the point. I was going to say that I was stuck for time and I did not want to accuse him of being a revolutionary, but he made some quite revolutionary points on Second Reading. He is absolutely right: if that situation arose, one can imagine the debates that would arise in the country, as well as in both Houses of Parliament, and the pressure on various Secretaries of State to make a policy change; in other words, to make change through legislation. It would be quite substantial if we got to that point. I am not saying that that will not happen; I am saying that we are setting out with the best intentions to give a lead and to be the first nation to put such detail into our legal framework.

You cannot get the equivalent effect without using the law. Civil servants, advisers to government and Ministers have to be reminded from time to time, as we all are, that you cannot do something, or that you cannot not do something, because you are going outside the law. We know the consequences of that, and I doubt that there has ever been a Minister in office who has not been reminded that they are expected to follow the law. There are degrees of discretion, but this must be looked at in the constitutional sense rather than in the sense that you have gone over the traffic lights and there is a fine. The objective of putting this into legislation in this way is to make that cultural and behavioural change in the Civil Service and consequently in government.

Those policies must be tested independently by the Committee on Climate Change and the court of public opinion, and the Secretary of State must make the necessary changes. We did say on Second Reading that the consequences of climate change, and the consequences of the Bill, will change how society operates and how we live. They will affect everyone in the country.

This is not necessarily a change for Ministers. It is about the advice that Ministers receive and the way they operate on it, bearing in mind that they are required to stay within the law.

France is unique because it is the only developed country in the world that I have seen that actually has a reduction plotted on a graph of its national carbon dioxide emissions. It is possible to go on to the internet and pull down the carbon performance of practically every economy in the world, and they are all plotted in graphs, which rise consistently, with the exception of France.

Why do we have &#147;net UK carbon account&#148;? I accept that it is a commonly used phrase and it is easy to slip past it, but the implication is that we can offset some of our emissions by actions that we take in third-party countries. We can continue with carbon emissions by aiding others. Again, that is all very worthy, but it is shilly-shallying. In effect, wealthy countries can purchase the right to continue doing what we do by aiding other countries. In a global sense, I accept that that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but if we want to lead, we actually have to reduce our emissions ourselves.

In terms of leadership and our global position in negotiations, it is very important, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has said, that it is seen as certain that we are looking to take the major hit in our own carbon emissions, rather than helping to stop others, noble cause though that may be.

I am presuming what the outcome is, effectively, for example, in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. It would mean that every country in Europe would have to achieve the same level of reduction, even if that is nonsense&#151;as it is indeed, even though the noble Lord shakes his head. If everybody in Europe agreed, there would be no net trading between the member states. Regardless of the position and circumstances of each country, they would all have to achieve the same reduction. That simply cannot make sense.

I understand the approach that was pleaded for at Second Reading, that we might start off being able to purchase and offset abroad but that we would gradually move away from that over a period of years. However, this amendment would not do that; far from it, it would go straight in. So it would straight away undermine the international approach to tackling climate change. That would not help anybody. It would not help the UK give a lead to other countries and the planet. We will meet our targets and we will ensure&#151;if I can use that word&#151;that the Secretary of State operates to meet them through both action to reduce UK emissions and action to support other countries in reducing their emissions. We need to do this in line with our EU and international obligations. That is by far the best way of doing it.

As regards leadership pretensions, the Bill will be thoroughly dissected by other countries and we need to be absolutely certain about which bit of ground we are standing on. To some people the relevant phrase will look like weakness, and we have to recognise that. I accept the practical realities of the situation. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, is quite right; we certainly do not want to become isolated on this issue, and I had no intention that we should. But the other way of looking at this&#151;if we qualified it a bit&#151;is that it would set a rather more severe and challenging 2050 target. One could perhaps come back with an amended amendment that would do that. However, it was important to have this discussion and I do not apologise for having it. Too many aspects of trading in carbon swaps and carbon offsets have, frankly, verged on the fraudulent. Even with the United Nations clean climate initiative, there are still large question marks over much of the trade that goes on because it is not a universally accepted standard and so there are very real difficulties with it.</p>

That is what affects the climate, not meeting a 60 or 80 per cent carbon reduction by 2050.

I believe that the 60 per cent target was set by a Royal Commission some years ago. We are all aware that the climate change science and our understanding of how global warming works have progressed hugely since then, and, indeed, since the draft Bill was published earlier this year. The IPCC itself has said that to keep within the limit of 2 degrees centigrade on a global basis we shall probably have to reduce carbon emissions across all nations by some 50 per cent by 2050. We believe that to achieve a fair and equitable solution for developed nations that figure needs to be something in the order of 80 per cent.</p>

Alternatively, we can stay with 60 per cent. Frankly, that is the worst option. Putting in what everyone accepts is the wrong figure would be wrong not only for the United Kingdom but also for our position globally. The third option is for us to put in the figure that we feel is, given that this is not an exact science, most realistic and most likely.</p>

<ul><a name="07121168000068">&#147;the evidence now suggests that, as part of an international agreement, developed countries may have to reduce their emissions by up to 80 per cent&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="07121168000063">We believe that it is important to have a target. That target needs to be realistic and the best understanding at this time is that 80 per cent is such a target.</p>

However, there is almost a guarantee of uncertainty in the 60 per cent target. Keeping a target until the Committee on Climate Change has been appointed, considered the evidence and come back within the time constraints would actually delay a decision. There is much greater certainty if we go for a realistic and a best figure now. Again, I applaud the Government&#146;s wish to lead globally on the targets, but that lead can be preserved only if we have a target of 80 per cent in the Bill now. I beg to move.</p>

However, I have come to the conclusion that circumstances have changed sufficiently, even since last summer, to make it right to include 80 per cent. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson said, the Prime Minister has already spoken of recognising that up to 80 per cent is likely to be the amount of reductions needed. We know that other countries are moving in that direction, too. France is considering legislation that would provide for emissions reductions of 75 to 80 per cent by 2050. The German Government have announced a legislative package incorporating cuts of 80 per cent by 2050.

Eighty per cent is a very ambitious figure, but ambition is what is needed, as we have seen recently in the science.</p>

Subsequent evidence should be carefully weighed up. The Bill makes provision for that to be done. In fact, it is an obligation on the Secretary of State to do so and to take the early advice of the independent committee. When all the stakeholders who are subsequently affected ask, &#147;Why is it 80 per cent and not 60 per cent?&#148;, the Secretary of State will be able to provide a coherent argument based on scientific evidence and the view of the independent committee. Then the stakeholders, whose behaviour has to change radically, will have the confidence and security that the basis is one that they can buy into. If the answer is that Parliament, having the Bill in front of it, said, &#147;We think 80 per cent is better; we will take a judgment by a vote on scientific evidence&#148;, that does not seem to me to be the way to get stakeholders to buy into and undertake the necessary change.</p>

That can be done in the light of evidence, so that the stakeholders&#151;who initially will largely be industry and, through that, consumers, although they may eventually, through personal allowances, be people more directly&#151;will be able to feel that this was not about votes by different people about whether it should be 60 per cent or 80 per cent. That is not the basis on which to take people with us. Rather, people should feel that due process has been followed. I would be surprised if the figure is not revised upwards.

It was absolutely fundamental to us that it should be independent, credible and listened to. I can think of no better way of achieving that than through the urgent first job of the committee being to review the process, review the figure, recommend 80 per cent and have 80 per cent accepted by the Government. That would establish that the Government, the Secretary of State and the committee were in lockstep, and it would establish the credibility of the committee.

It is best left to the committee&#151;noble Lords have put the case for that. We admit that the 60 per cent target is an old one; it is seven years old. It is consistent with the European Council conclusions in March 2007, which called on developing countries to reduce their emissions by  60 to 80 per cent. The Bill says, &#147;at least 60%&#148; by 2050. The view of Stern was that developing countries needed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent. There have been significant advances in science since the 60 per cent target was set&#151;everyone admits that; the Government admit that, and the Prime Minister could not have been be clearer in his speech. We should wait for the Committee on Climate Change before deciding the appropriate target. We want a considered view, based on the best evidence, of the cost of changing from 60 to another figure&#151;I do not say 80 per cent, just another figure.</p>

The implications need to be understood before a decision is taken; that is the role of the Climate Change Committee. There is no doubt that there will be economic costs. Stern says that the earlier these things are done, the cheaper it will be. We need to look at the effect of the rest of the world taking meaningful action on climate change; the Committee on Climate Change can do that. On the other hand, what would be the implications of including other greenhouse gases, if the UK was going it alone? We are dealing only with some of the greenhouse gases here. They are all defined in the Bill; we will come to them later on. Before we take a decision of this magnitude, it is important that we have a clear understanding. That view is shared by the two Front Benchers and, probably, the majority of those who have spoken. If there was a quick vote on &#147;Yes or no; what would you prefer?&#148;, the overwhelming majority would be clear: the figure would change. I say that as a non-scientist; our view is to wait for the committee to be set up on the basis of what the Prime Minister said.</p>

The point of my amendment is to flush out exactly how wobbly the target is, whether it is 60 or 80 per cent, given the amount of international credits that can be used when it comes to the UK&#146;s own emissions reduction. The draft regulatory impact assessment suggested that the UK&#146;s emissions might be reduced by just 40 per cent by 2050, given the use of all the international credits.</p>

The second is the seriousness with which we will take behaviour change. Those two things are the key to the success of the Bill. If we aimed to achieve most of the target within the UK, that would be a clear signal to industry that emitting carbon would become increasingly expensive, because the Government will have to introduce extremely harsh policies to reduce emissions or they will miss the target. As the Bill is drafted, the unlimited potential for the use of carbon credits undermines both objectives of investment and behaviour change. I am looking, in the Minister&#146;s reply, for how he will create the atmosphere of certainty while allowing so much flexibility within the international trading scheme.</p>

In allowing emissions to be offset by carbon credits, the carbon price will be substantially reduced. In some ways, that is not a bad thing. The theory of emissions trading emphasises that a reduction of 1 tonne of greenhouse gases is equal anywhere in the world; we all accept that. We have already heard today the argument that, instead of pursuing expensive reductions at home, it is cheaper&#151;I think that the Minister said &#163;3 billion cheaper&#151;for the Government to invest in projects that will reduce emissions abroad. Of course, on that side of the argument he did not state that, by creating a really low-carbon economy here and leading the technology, you are likely to arrive at a far higher figure in terms of net income to the UK, because we will be leading an economy that the world will be hungry for.

Those principles emphasise that developed countries are high emitters, historically, and that developing countries have a right to sustainable development. The developed world must take the lead by demonstrating that it can reduce emissions at home. There should be strong statements in the Bill. I have tabled amendments to make sure that the monitoring and assessing of how much of the target is met by foreign trading will be clear. As the Bill is drafted, it can be left opaque, which would be disgraceful. Unless we are clear on those issues, that will undermine two of the fundamental purposes of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

While you might be moving towards an actual 60 or 80 per cent decarbonised economy, on the way you have the EU ETS for which I am a strong missionary. All that still goes on, because individual businesses are trading under a cap-and-trade system, so that cap is coming down. All the advantages that we know of in trading systems, such as exiting the most costly areas first and making the best, least cost, benefits first, still happens.

I know that it has been said before, but it is worth making the point: environmentally, it does not matter where on the planet the reductions take place, so long as they are proper reductions&#151;that goes without saying. International reductions must be quite legitimate. It does not matter where they are, because a tonne of CO2 emitted anywhere is still going to be damaging. Emissions trading will work by allowing emissions to be reduced in the most cost-effective way. As I have said, our analysis of the costs of meeting the 2050 target concluded that emissions trading would allow us to meet our targets, and with the same environmental benefit, for &#163;5 billion&#151;not &#163;3 billion&#151;less than otherwise. The analysis published by the European Commission on meeting Kyoto targets confirmed this, finding that the costs could be reduced by a third through emissions trading.</p>

If the idea is to stop anything that does not work in the UK&#151;and that rules out the European Union as well&#151;then we must clearly say so in the amendment. If it is thought morally wrong to go trading, then it must be dealt with in another way altogether rather than making a case, as the noble Baroness did, of which the practical consequences are to rule out emissions trading full stop. That effect would not wait until 2050; that is my point and the advice I have got. It may be looked at again in later stages of the Bill, but that is the practical consequence of the amendment, or anything similar to it, being carried.</p>

One decides what to measure and businesses or industry&#151;not governments&#151;make decisions about whether to trade under an ETS. Governments set the cap through the Commission, through national allocation plans, and trading takes place. That can continue ad infinitum, whether this amendment has been accepted or not. The amendment determines what you count. The Government already have a purely UK emissions target without any trading and they will probably miss it. I think the target is 20 per cent carbon reduction by 2010. There is no difference between that being a target or that being law, but having that target does not stop the EU ETS happening now any more than the amendment would stop that happening in the future. It concerns what you measure, not what you have to do. Clearly, the EU ETS will continue and we hope it will be very successful in making carbon economies throughout Europe far more efficient, but it will not stop because you measure something that is different, just as the purely UK targets for carbon reductions, which allow no buying-in or buying-out, do not affect it either. They are exactly the same.</p>

I find it slightly difficult to understand why there should be one rule for one amendment and a different rule for a different amendment, according to some minds. We need to recognise what the Minister is postulating as an end game when we  get to 2050. As far as I can see there is no such thing as a completely carbon-neutral economy. Certain industries will still require fossil fuels to operate. The obvious category is the smelting industry, which reduces metal ores to basic metal. Coal is used there not as a fuel to produce heat but to produce a chemical reaction. The cement industry has the same problem. Those industries will continue to use coal whatever happens if we are to have a supply of the raw materials that we shall continue to need and, more importantly, the raw materials that will be needed on an ever-greater scale globally for population reasons, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon. We may well find that, because of fuel density, aviation has to continue to use fossil fuels, and shipping may have to for similar reasons.</p>

It might mean that our target should be more than 100 per cent. I think that is where the logic will take us in the end. Not only will we require to use fossil fuels but so will every other country. The developed world can gain a very real benefit through the trading scheme in investing in other countries so that their benefit in carbon-free development helps us to continue with these fundamental industries about which we will probably be able to do nothing.

If he is none the less kept in prison, he is no longer being punished for what he has done but for what his past record suggests that he might do in future. In other words, he is de facto an internee, or someone held in preventive detention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="07121177000039">There may perhaps be a case for selective internment or, if you prefer, preventive detention, for those previously convicted of serious violent crimes. I am not competent to judge. To some extent, that would be comparable to indefinite detention in Rampton or Broadmoor. However, if that is to continue, it should surely be described as such and not disguised as something else, as it is at present. Moreover, it should be widely debated and then, if in principle agreed to, properly codified by an Act of Parliament. Above all, I submit, anyone so detained after his set term of punishment has expired should be entitled to as many prison privileges and comforts as are consistent with the safety and security of the prison staff and the public. I very much doubt that that happens at the moment.</p>

The word &#147;indeterminate&#148; would seem to mean something akin to &#147;at Her Majesty's Pleasure&#148;, which in turn means a sentence which can be one without end and might typically include those committed to secure hospitals such as Broadmoor because of extreme mental disturbance. Otherwise, in the absence of a capital punishment, the most severe sentence of all is a whole-life tariff, when people are sentenced to live out their lives in prison&#151;which is still, mercifully, a small minority of the prison population, although we in this country have more people on whole-life tariffs than the whole of the rest of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="07121177000042">As we have already heard from my noble friend Lord Carlile, there are 11 offences that make a person eligible for an automatic life sentence, but these are normally set with time limits and a foreseeable end. In the case of an IPP, there are no fewer than 153 specified offences deemed to be very serious offences of a sexual or violent nature, normally carrying a penalty of 10 years or more. It would seem to be a classic and blatant case of net-widening when so many more offences can end in such an outcome as, or more serious than, a life sentence.</p>

<a name="71211-0012.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="07121177000043">Like a life sentence, IPPs involve a minimum prison term, after which a prisoner will be expected to undergo various behaviour management courses designed to reduce or eliminate the risk that he is seen to present and will then be released at the discretion of the Parole Board. That release is on licence under supervision for at least 10 years and after that only if the Parole Board considers it safe to set him free. That supervision could theoretically otherwise last for life.</p>

<a name="71211-0012.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="07121177000044">The presumption is that behaviour management courses of the kind done in a prison setting can produce a more law-abiding, less dangerous person once he gets out into the real world. The reality is that those courses are simply not available in the quantity necessary for those people to win their release. The Home Office has estimated that that would cost an extra &#163;10 million. While the Ministry of Justice's budget is being cut and all related services are having to cut back on their budgets by at least 3 per cent year on year for the next five years, the likelihood of those courses becoming more available must be nil.</p>

<a name="71211-0012.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="07121177000045">That is completely unacceptable. First, that anybody of sound mind could be detained&#151;potentially indefinitely&#151;because of something that he might do in the future rather than what he has actually done must be wrong. As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, said, there is a different category that such people could become, that of an internee, but that is not our starting point or where we expect to end. Secondly, it is a given among all who work in prisons that uncertainty about the future is one of the most destabilising situations that anyone could have to deal with, for prisoners and prison officers alike. Lastly, if the planning and resources are not there, imprisonment continues because of the failure of the Government to provide them, and not for any further fault.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="07121177000046">As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, has already flagged up, I have had a letter from a serving prisoner whose tariff was a mere 28 days but who was then unable to have a review by the Parole Board because the requisite service courses were simply not available to him. He has now served two years. He has recently been moved to a prison where there is a course and is hoping that he will be able to complete it in time for the next parole hearing. If not, he will have to wait another year. That is the only means by which he can demonstrate that he has changed and so win his release&#151;all that following a basic sentence of 28 days.

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="07121177000048">What are the guidelines accompanying the use of IPPs? As far as I am aware, the Sentencing Guidelines Council did not give advice on their application. I would like to ask the Minister what the role of the SGC was in the framing and application of IPPs and whether there was any modelling or serious projections made of their use before they were introduced. Did the Government expect the current, impossible situation in which we find ourselves today? Since April 2005, when IPPs became one of the available options to courts, there are now just under 3,000 prisoners serving these sentences&#151;in just two years. Of them, 728 are under 21 years-old and very few have been released. Official estimates are that the IPP population will reach 25,000 by 2012&#151;almost a third of the entire prison population. As we have also heard, following Lord Carter&#146;s report, the Secretary of State for Justice has announced that the minimum tariff should be raised to two years, which is, at least, an acknowledgement that things are getting out of hand. We are left today with a situation in which people are sent to prison on an IPP, to serve a tariff, but only with the possibility of release once courses are done&#151;when courses are not available. Should they become available, then licence on supervision by community agencies&#151;principally, presumably, the Probation Service&#151;for 10 years will be expected, by a service that is facing huge cuts on its already overstretched current budgets, let alone one with resources for such extra demands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="07121177000049">One can conclude only that this initiative is fundamentally impractical, unsustainable and wrong. I sincerely hope that the Government will rethink all elements of what has turned out to be a practical and moral failure.</p>

Instead, the Government now try to manage future risk possibilities that might occur in relation to individuals in the future. A culture is growing that has moved the criminal justice system away from punishing people for offences that they have committed to trying to control future behaviour, which can be seen in ASBOs, serious crime orders and all the stuff that comes out of the Home Office.</p>

Having said that, we obviously will return to this issue when we debate the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. Following the Carter report which the Minister presented to us last week, he and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor gave us an assurance that they would bring forward various changes to IPPs and therefore would amend Sections 225 and 226 of the 2003 Act when that Bill comes before us.

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="07121177000063">Having said that, I have a number of questions for the noble Lord, to which I would be grateful for an answer. It is depressing that one of new Labour&#146;s flagship pieces of legislation is already being pulled apart. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, to which I referred, will make changes to the 2003 Act. I understand that other parts of the Act have not been implemented and that we now have a wholesale review of the use of indeterminate sentences for public protection. That is further indication that considerable amounts of criminal justice legislation coming out of the Home Office in the past few years have not been thought through as well as they should have been. As I have said, we live in hope that the new Ministry of Justice will manage a slightly better job. The Minister is smiling, but I do not know whether that is in desperation. We look forward to some improvement from the glory days&#151;as we might put it&#151;of the Home Office.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="07121177000064">Given that there are only finite amounts of resource and an ever-growing prison population, even if the Government admit that they cannot predict exactly what figure it will grow to, we know that we will have an evermore over-crowded estate even with the new places being promised. Does that mean that it is even more likely that prisoners serving IPPs will find it increasingly difficult to access the courses they need in order to prove that they have been rehabilitated? The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, mentioned a prisoner in Aylesbury who could not get access to the appropriate courses and therefore could not be processed beyond the stage that he was in. We know also from evidence that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has given to the justice committee in another place that &#163;3 million more has been given to help prisoners access the courses that they need to aid their rehabilitation and thus their release.</p>

I hope that the Minister will confirm this evening that that extra resource will be made available.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="07121177000066">It looks as though this is yet another clear example of the Government failing to plan for the future. The Minister will be aware that Sir Igor Judge has said that the Parole Board might need 100 judges to deal with the backlog and to meet the number coming through because of the numbers currently on these tariffs that will need to be assessed before release. Surely that problem did not creep up on the Government overnight, just as the problem of the appointment of new judges has not crept up on the Government overnight. The Government ought to be doing something to address those issues.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="07121177000067">Figures seem to indicate that something like half of all the sentences given for threats to kill, child sex offences, arson or sexual assaults resulted in a tariff of less than two years. If the Government press ahead with their plans&#151;and obviously this is something which we will debate in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill when it comes through&#151;these people will not be eligible for IPPs given that their sentence length will be below the threshold. Does the Minister accept that there is a reason why judges sentence people to IPPs? Judges might have problems with them but they are presumably sentencing to that because they feel those people to be dangerous. Why are the Government so keen to remove that power from the courts? Is it merely yet another attempt by the Government to reduce the numbers in prison and to reduce those numbers artificially so as&#151;I put it this way last week when debating something similar&#151;to massage the figures yet further downwards?</p>

We have been debating these issues for about a year, starting with the Mental Health Bill, which covered a number of very interesting issues connected with the criminal justice system, and it is a great pleasure for me to respond to his typically informative, assertive and very interesting contribution. We had 10 minutes for the Oral Question this morning as the Question on international waterways went rather quickly. That shows the scale of interest in prison issues. We will debate some of these matters in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill when it reaches your Lordships&#146;

Subsequent to the Statement on the Carter review we had the Written Ministerial Statement on the Government&#146;s response to my noble friend Lady Corston&#146;s interesting report on women prisoners, so there is much to discuss.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="07121179000002">In view of what the noble Lord, Lord Monson, said, it is important to set out the background to Sections 225 and 226 of the Criminal Justice Act. As many noble Lords will recall, these measures were introduced as a package of public protection sentences in response to cases where offenders who had previously been convicted of sexual or violent offences that were not sufficiently serious to keep them in prison for a great many years went on to commit graver offences. Ministers decided that further action had to be taken to enhance public protection to enable those who presented a real risk of serious harm to the public to be detained in prison until the risk had reduced sufficiently to make them safe to release. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, in particular disagrees with that assessment. That is fair enough. I am sure we will debate it again and again, but it is important to set out the context in which the legislation was brought about. I do not need to go into great detail about what the law says because the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, set that out very clearly. However, I want to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, who talked about the glory days of the Home Office. Of course, he would know. There is a legitimate question about the number of Criminal Justice Bills that have been passed in the past 20 years. The reality is that there have been many&#151;my reckoning is 68 Bills since 1997. I will not go into the reasons for that or ask the noble Lord, Lord Henley, to respond to me today on the previous Government&#146;s record. I will say, however&#151;and I will come back to this in a moment&#151;that the recommendation by my noble friend Lord Carter of a structured sentencing framework is very important, and will be the subject of a working group led by a member of the judiciary, which I hope will provide a very helpful rational basis on which to consider criminal justice legislation and its interrelationship with penal policy in the future.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="07121179000003">As noble Lords have already remarked, 3,550 offenders have received an IPP sentence since that became available. Noble Lords have identified some of the real practical challenges that we face as a consequence of some of those sentences. I will come on to those in a moment. I have no doubt that many of those sentences were entirely appropriate, but we know from the comments made by senior judges and others that the framework imposed by the 2003 Act may have restricted judicial discretion unduly and resulted in sentences when a standard determinate sentence might have been fairer and more appropriate.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="07121179000004">Noble Lords have already referred to the lowest tariff of 28 days being imposed. I fully accept that it is very difficult to find a rationale for saying, on the one hand, that an offender has committed a crime that is so serious, and that he is so risky, that he could need to be locked up for the remainder of his life; and, on  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the other hand, that he could be released after 28 days. Even if that is a particularly stark example, there are plenty of other IPP sentences with relatively short tariffs, and I do not seek to run away from that at all. There is no doubt that one consequence is that the prison system has been struggling to treat IPP offenders as we envisaged when we drafted the legislation and as we wish offenders to be treated. It is true that we have not been able to offer offenders the level of sentence planning and access to behavioural programmes that we would have wished. In turn, that risks making it more difficult for offenders to satisfy the Parole Board&#151;and I accept the comments made about the pressure on the Parole Board&#151;that they are a safe prospect for release. In turn, that means that the numbers in prison are further increased by the low release rate. I do not seek to underestimate the challenge that that poses.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="07121179000005">The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, asked whether modelling was done. It was, and it would be fair to say that it was not far out in terms of the overall numbers. I would not underestimate the modelling expertise of the Home Office and now my department, having seen the modelling done by my old department, the Department of Health. These matters are difficult, but I am not unimpressed with the modelling that has been done.</p>

I said that modelling can be difficult, and that the actual numbers were not too far out. The short tariffs, which were not expected in the modelling, have caused the problem. I know that my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland discussed this, and responded in good faith in the way that was quoted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="07121179000008">The noble Lords, Lord Carlile and Lord Thomas, in particular referred to the cases that my department has lost in the courts. We are now awaiting the results of the appeals. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, did not hold out much hope for the Government, but we will have to wait and see.</p>

If the Government lose the appeals, which must be at least a 50:50 prospect, they will be forced to release prisoners who have reached their tariff period but who have not been assessed by the Parole Board. They will be released simply because they have reached that point in their sentence, whereas those who have been considered by the Parole Board and may have had a decision that is adverse to them&#151;that they should stay in for longer&#151;will be at a much greater disadvantage. What plans do the Government have to deal with this extraordinary position, which is now staring them in the face a few weeks away?</p>

We will have to see the outcome of the appeal and the nature of the ruling of the Appeal Court: the noble Lord would not expect me to say anything other than that. It is not as though we are putting our heads in the sand and doing nothing. The department is looking at contingency arrangements and operational changes. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, has already referred to the interim measure of allocating a further &#163;3 million in the current financial year to help prisons to complete assessments and move offenders on to relevant offending behaviour programmes. Clearly, we are also looking at the detailed operation of IPPs through an internal service review to see how we can streamline the process for assessing and managing IPP offenders.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="07121179000011">The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, referred to a  3 per cent reduction in resources over five years. It is not as bad as that. It is a tough settlement&#151;again, I do not seek to hide from that&#151;of minus 1.7 per cent per year over the next three years. Within that, we have to improve the efficiency of the department. My noble friend Lord Carter has put forward some considered proposals about how we can drive more efficiency in the Prison Service.</p>

Certainly, the Probation Service is looking at cuts of the nature that I quoted, not the Prison Service.</p>

The figure that I have is a 70 per cent real-terms increase. Notwithstanding that, we clearly face a challenging position. However, we will obviously look at the resources very carefully.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="07121179000014">Over that period, we have seen considerable increases in the resources spent on prison healthcare as a result of the transfer of responsibility to the Department of Health and on offender learning. The picture is not wholly bleak. There are examples of real progress within the Prison Service in relation to rehabilitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="07121179000015">We will of course come soon to legislation. The report of my noble friend Lord Carter has clearly shown the way forward in introducing a minimum tariff of two years. We will introduce legislation to ensure that that happens. That will make a significant contribution to my noble friend&#146;s demand management proposals. I do not accept that this is a question of massaging the figures, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said. The report of my noble friend Lord Carter is quite clear. To meet the challenge of the prison population projections of around 96,000 places required by 2014, he suggests a combination of supply increase and demand management. The IPPs will make a significant contribution to demand management. That is not massaging the figures. It is a very sensible approach in the light of experience. Noble Lords have posed some

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="07121179000016">The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, referred to what he described as unpredicted and unpredictable consequences as a result of the legislative changes. The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, said that this was unsustainable. The package of measures, the immediate changes to how the IPP system operates and the Carter proposals&#151;which we will seek to put into legislation&#151;will have a significant impact.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="07121179000017">The Carter recommendation on a structured sentence framework offers a way of ensuring that there is a strong, transparent relationship between legislative policy, penal policy and resources, without in any way fettering the decisions of judges when they pass individual sentences. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, and the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, commented on prisoners with mental health problems. I commend to noble Lords the review that has been jointly commissioned by my department and the Department of Health to look in particular at the problems of offenders with mental health or learning disabilities, to see how, in appropriate cases, they can be diverted from prison to other services, and the barriers to such diversion.</p>

<a name="07121182000005"><b><a name="71211-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="07121182000036">Earl Cathcart:</b> Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 seek to achieve a very similar objective. Amendment No. 11 would set a duty on the committee within six months of its constitution to propose a new 2050 target for approval by Parliament. If it is so approved, the Secretary of State must make an order under Clause 2 to amend the 2050 target.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="07121182000006">We believe that setting the target is a scientific problem, or more aptly it is a problem that can be properly assessed only in scientific terms. It should not be a political issue. We discussed setting the target under Amendment No. 7, and what the right answer should be. We have all read about the 80 per cent target and we all know that 60 per cent is not the right answer. As has been mentioned, the Germans have achieved an 80 per cent target. The Norwegians have achieved a 100 per cent target. France has achieved a 75 per cent target. So who is right? I do not have a view on who is right, and I would not even like to stab a guess. I am not a scientist and I have not seen all the evidence. I suspect that some noble Lords might have seen some of it but they certainly will not have seen all the evidence. That is why we think that setting the target is best left to the committee, when it has looked at all the evidence.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="07121182000007">When Amendment No. 7 was discussed, the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, who is not in his place, and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, argued that the target ought to be set by the committee. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said that letting the committee set it would give the committee credibility. I go further: it would give credibility not just to the committee but to the percentage chosen through the fact that it was chosen by an independent committee of experts. If the target were set by the committee, there would be no question of this House picking a percentage out of a hat. We certainly could not then be accused of choosing a figure for political expediency.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="07121182000008">This is also a question of public confidence. It is important that the public should have confidence in this and not see it as a political issue. In order for the Bill to be effective, the public will have to make a concerted effort; if they are to be compelled into action, they need to be able to trust that the targets are absolutely authoritative. That will be achieved by having an independent expert body setting the targets. Our amendment will give this task to the committee and it will achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="07121182000010">I start off by saying that we want to think about these amendments. The Government recognise the significant recent advances in scientific understanding since the 60 per cent target was set, as has been discussed at length today. As the Prime Minister has stated, the evidence now suggests that developed countries may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 80 per cent if we are to have an effective international agreement that will tackle climate change. That is why we have announced that we  will ask the Committee on Climate Change to report on whether the 2050 target should be tightened up to 80 per cent.</p>

<a name="71211-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="07121182000011">The Government are committed to ensuring that that review takes place. We have already begun to put the committee&#146;s shadow secretariat in place and to recruit a chair and members of the shadow committee. That means that the committee&#146;s work on reviewing the target can begin quickly, alongside its consideration of the first three budgets. I assure the noble Earl that matters are moving forward with great commitment and speed. Although I do not consider it necessary to make this review a statutory requirement&#151;as the Prime Minister has already announced it, it will take place&#151;I recognise the strength of the arguments put forward this evening and am therefore willing to consider these amendments.</p>

First, on the question of timing raised earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, we are currently discussing a realistic timetable and the resources required for this review with the shadow secretariat to the Committee on Climate Change. We are talking about an independent secretariat so it is important that we understand its needs and concerns before discussing in your Lordships&#146; House what the timetable would look like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="07121182000013">Secondly, I would like to pick up on the question of who takes the decisions. In later debates in Committee, we will be discussing further whether the responsibility for decisions on targets and budgets should rest with the Committee on Climate  Change. I understand the points made by the noble Lords opposite&#151;whether responsibility should be with the committee, the Secretary of State or  indeed the Prime Minister. We will come on to that. Putting those points aside, the Government are prepared to consider the question of the target being reviewed as a statutory requirement. With that, I hope that the noble Earl will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

No order could be made without the recommendation of the committee and the approval of both Houses as part of the combination, but it must be made if those conditions are met. If the committee is made subject to the same limitations on the exercise of power, those should be the same as the Secretary of State would enjoy under the Bill. The detailed form of the order would still be left to the Secretary of State, so I hope that noble Lords can see that we are bringing the Committee on Climate Change into the process, with its approval necessary for something to come before us here in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="07121182000022">This is about transferring power to the committee. A large tenet of our position on the Bill lies in this quarter. All the things that we have mentioned thus far apply to this set of amendments. Additionally, when changes are made to the baseline year or the targets, that would require parliamentary approval. That is a positive addition, because such a proposal would amount to a substantial change to the Bill. We want the Bill to live up to the importance that it deserves and such a change will reflect something dramatic enough to need the scrutiny of Parliament, especially as the outcome of the decision will affect every piece of legislation and policy. It is in the interests of the public and all parliamentarians to have any such change presented openly to both Houses. It is too big a change, with effects that are far too wide-ranging, for it simply to be made through an order.</p>

Perhaps it would not, because there is usually an alert Member of this House keeping an eye open for these things. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State could simply amend the heart of the Bill without anyone really knowing. We need parliamentary approval to allow for public scrutiny, as well as scrutiny in Westminster, of the reasons for adjusting the targets and the baseline year. The Bill will affect everyone in its implementation. It needs to have the transparency and authority that will have public support throughout. We need consensus; we have consensus on so much on this Bill and we need consensus to change things in this way. I commend the amendments to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

The only discretion that the Government would have would be not to bring the order to the House. If they brought an order, it would have to be from the recommendation of the committee, so the process would not be triangular. To be triangular, it would need another form of words.

The committee is being set up as an independent expert body&#151;there is no question about that&#151;because we want to manage the framework for emissions in a more transparent fashion that is more likely to deliver results. Clause 3 already requires, before amending the 2050 target or baseline year, that the Secretary of State must consult the committee as well as the devolved Administrations.

That is crucial. I am with the noble Lord precisely on that. Frankly, I will be more than happy to look at that aspect of the matter because, judging by his speech, that is what he is searching for, but the amendments do not do that.

The committee&#146;s advice will be highly influential and, as I said in an earlier debate, judging from what has been said in earlier debates it would be a brave Secretary of State who would come to Parliament with substantial variations from what the committee had recommended. If that were the case, they would have to explain that situation to Parliament and the court of public opinion, because we would have set up an independent body of world-class people who must be taken seriously.

In this House, I have not introduced that many Bills and therefore have not done it many times, but this note is still required when they come from the other place. I have known examples over recent years, which I will not go into, where there has been a debate about particular Bills and the Ministers were concerned to seek extra advice about whether they were truly compatible with human rights legislation.

Because many aspects of society and living will be affected by attempts to meet the targets in the Bill, there will be difficulty for the lawyers in assessing any particular legislation. Everything would be covered by the need to make that kind of statement relating to the climate change targets, including legislation on housing, health, or on individual human relationships that have nothing to do with climate change, such as in marriage legislation. It would be incredibly complicated for lawyers to give advice on that, leaving aside the scientific uncertainty in some areas. I am not knocking that.

How you define legislation, I do not know. There are better brains than mine in the Parliamentary Counsel Office to consider that.

The only exception would be where the information or data were commercially confidential or subject to exemptions, such as to allow for ongoing policy development.

The length of budget periods is important to everybody in terms of business and planning. It is important to Government, Parliament and all the stakeholders in the climate change issue. We on these Benches believe that five years is too long. Why is it too long? Nearly all Administrations last four years or less; certainly they do not extend beyond five years. This means that we will not know whether any commitment entered into by a Government has been met until the next Administration or the next Parliament. We do not feel that that is healthy.

We take decisions based on the short term. That is true for organisational planning. In the first year we think five years is a long way off and we normally do not get around to taking it seriously until at least year three. That is very dangerous because, as the Minister has reminded us several times this evening, the earlier and the quicker we take action, the less painful that action is. A five-year time horizon is too far away to concentrate minds and get action that will help carbon emissions and reduce future global warming. We feel that three years is much more suitable. There are other arguments&#151;such as the fact that spending reviews are around that period of time as well&#151;but if there are not interim targets or there are not interim milestones, a three-year period is even more important.

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="07121185000059">These emissions vary from year to year, and five years is a sufficiently long period in which to get the feel of things without it being too short a period to be blown off track by seasonal variations that may occur. It is no way to set up an alibi for failing to meet commitments. Having a shorter timeframe, while keeping it within one Government&#146;s term in office, might have a negative effect. If there were a boost in the shorter term of three years because of warmer weather, airline strikes or a power station closing, there could be a risk of thinking that improvements were being made when actually nothing was being done to tackle climate change. There is a mathematical reason why a short period can give much more unreliable data than a longer one. We therefore want five-year targets, which provide an opportunity to see success, combined with annual milestones, which we will discuss shortly, to track shorter-term progress.</p>

I therefore believe that my noble friend is right to say on this occasion that a five-year period is reasonable. It also, incidentally, chimes quite well with international agreements.

I know we had one that did&#151;I shall say nothing about that&#151;but this will escape from that normal political cycle. That will be an immense strength, because Governments standing for election will have to recognise that there is a commitment for the future that must be met. There will be no excuse for attempting to argue that, because we have had an election, we can do something different. It might be possible to make adjustments in the following five-year cycle, but they will have to recognise in any election that commitments have been made with a view to the 42-year or 43-year timescale that we are working to.

First, for many businesses, the idea that five years is a long time and three is appropriate is far from the truth. The overall targets that the committee will introduce will, I assume, be the result of building up a number of sectoral targets. In some sectors, to break down targets into three-year as opposed to five-year periods would be impossible. In the power-generating industry, to break down into a succession of three-year periods what will happen over 15 years is pie in the sky. The result would be that the committee would become discredited. The committee would set not only the overall target but a number of sectoral proposals. They are as important as the overall target because what does the target mean for different sectors and consumers&#151;the people who actually buy the product? If time and again the three-year figure is not remotely met, very quickly, the series of three-year targets would be discredited. If when the committee is established it is asked whether it would prefer three five-year periods or five three-year periods, I have no doubt what the answer would be. The noble Lord should consider that point.</p>

That is a reality we have to face and the sooner we face it, the better.</p>

In the sectorial targets that were mentioned you would be building on those things that have come before, especially in the energy industry. It would have to meet this. We should not underestimate the job that the Government are setting out. The task ahead is to make a 2 per cent cut, year on year, for the next 40 years, which is not a small amount to propose. My problem with a five-year period is the very real opportunity to put back the difficult decisions to the end of the period, especially for any Government that had just come in and were making up the policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="07121185000069">We have a major issue here. If we are to keep within the graph, we have the issue that there might be a particularly warm winter. We might have the same situation as last winter, when the spot price on gas meant that coal-fired power stations were pulled back on-line. There is nothing to say that, although we have had this great dash to gas, in a few years&#146; time, with the nuclear stations coming off-line and gas prices going up because of external factors, coal-fired power stations will not be brought on-line to meet that need, and we would go into reverse on these targets. Therefore, to look at a five-year graph might be a problem. If we are talking about 40 years, in five years we are talking only about meeting eight targets. If we are talking about three years, there are 12 targets to meet, which can be met on an incremental basis.</p>

In a number of Bills that I have dealt with, whenever anybody talked about something being on a five-year basis, in parliamentary terms, it was always on the understanding that it was never going to happen. If it was Lords reform for the next Parliament, it would be put into the next Parliament because it was never going to happen.

If we are talking about the next 40 years it is quite possible that a Secretary of State will, in their period of office, see only one of these targets met on a three-year basis, if they are lucky. If you did the analysis, you would find that, even on a three-year basis, most Secretaries of State would not see even one. In some cases, they move on to greater things; in other cases, obviously, they just get fired or end up in your Lordships&#146; House. </p>

Possibly, for the first year or two, the target ought to be 1 per cent only, or something of that order. If you look at the record of our energy consumption for the past 30 years, you will see that our energy efficiency has increased enormously, as has our output, and that our actual energy consumption has floated along more or less on a flat line graph. It is a very interesting graph which we need to consider much more deeply. Once we begin to change technology, which we shall have to do, the initial steps will be slow. However, once they begin to build, we will go quicker and quicker and in the later stages of our progress I suspect that we may well find that the climate change committee will say, &#147;Okay, we can go at 5 per cent per annum&#148;. That will be perfectly acceptable because the changes will be in motion. It certainly will not be a straight line graph and if anybody thinks that it will be, they are daydreaming.</p>

Subsection (4) allows the Treasury to give a direction to a reclaim fund requiring it to give effect to any specified object that it has&#151;the objects are set out in subsection (1)&#151;and it also allows the Treasury to direct that the reclaim fund will comply with the obligatory articles of association, as set out in Schedule 1.</p>

<p><a name="07121159000010">Will the Minister explain why the Treasury needs these powers and how it intends to use them? Why, for example, does it have the power to tell a fund to give effect to one of its objects? Does that allow the Treasury to set the financial policy of the reclaim fund, whether it is the reserving policy or perhaps its investment policy? Can the Minister explain why the Treasury needs to be the enforcer of the fund&#146;s articles? It is also the case that the reclaim fund will be under the care and supervision of the Financial Services Authority&#151;we established that yesterday and Schedule 2 gives effect to it&#151;but why does the reclaim fund have to be interfered with by both the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority? We saw in relation to Northern Rock what a mess can be made if more than one body has responsibility for a financial institution.

Yesterday, the Minister described the reclaim fund as a private sector body, but does he expect it to be classified as such in national accounts terms? Is, then, the Government&#146;s position that the existence of the powers of direction does not cause the reclaim fund to be classified to the public sector, giving the Treasury power of control over the fund? Would the same conclusion be reached if the Treasury ever exercised its power of direction?</p>

The Bill has some provisions relating to the reclaim fund but it says very little about who will decide how it is constituted and how its directors are appointed&#151;I have a probing amendment on that further on in the Marshalled List. Is it to be a creature of the BBA? What will its relationship be with other bodies that might conceivably take on this role, such as Charity Bank, and how will it work? More specifically, to pursue a point raised yesterday by my noble friend Lord Shutt, who talked about the importance of the judgment of the directors of the reclaim fund, under the clause that we are debating now will the Treasury be able to overrule the directors in respect of the proportion of the funds received by the reclaim fund which are dispersed?</p>

The Treasury&#146;s own explanation ends by stating that the direction does no more than require a company to give effect to, or to comply with, requirements to which it is already subject under the Bill and which will previously have been approved by Parliament. I thought that the Minister&#146;s explanation yesterday was that the regulatory system was a matter for the FSA, not the Treasury itself.</p>

In moving the amendment, my noble friend said that it was unusual for a private sector body to be given directions by the Treasury. I have some difficulty in thinking of any example at all. Perhaps the Minister can provide a list of those, so we know whether we are going into completely uncharted waters. I am also puzzled by subsection (4), which states that the Treasury may give a direction to comply with the obligations or prohibitions imposed by its articles of association. That seems a very unusual provision.</p>

We have argued throughout that we want light-touch regulation of the reclaim fund, which is a private body. The answer to the noble Baroness is straightforward in those terms. What does it mean in terms of regulation? We have said that there are certain aspects where the Financial Services Authority will operate regulations with regard to the reclaim fund. The FSA will receive those powers through secondary legislation, consequent on passage of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07121159000017">The Treasury will have a most distant relationship with the reclaim fund. It is not the case, as some on the other side of the Committee may fear, that the Treasury will have a clear perspective on priorities and seek to impose those on the fund&#151;very far from it. All that the Treasury will do is occupy a position of last resort under the law. If the reclaim fund was not fulfilling its articles and not acting responsibly, the Treasury could take court action against the fund. That is how distant the relationship is. It will not be the authority of government controlling this body but, as a very last resort, having failed to respond to issues which the FSA may have raised with the reclaim fund, the Treasury acting at that great distance.</p>

Can the Minister explain what he means by &#147;acting responsibly&#148;? We need some colour around what it is that this power of direction is aimed at. He says that this power of direction is a last resort. Who will determine what &#147;acting responsibly&#148; means?</p>

What is the fund&#146;s primary purpose? As we have made clear in the Bill, it is to set as its first objective the taking of steps to ensure that, as far as possible, accounts are reclaimed by their rightful owners. That is an important objective that will, as we have already indicated, be achieved by the extensive work of the banks and building societies in preparation for enactment of the legislation. It will be a function also of the reclaim fund. After that the question will be whether there had been an obvious misdirection of activity by the reclaim fund. If the fund, for example, put forward excessive costs to which the FSA drew attention, and if within those costs lay attempts to increase the remuneration of those working for the fund in a way not in keeping with the fund&#146;s establishment, then the reclaim fund would have to recognise the authority of the FSA. But if effective action were not taken, then, as a last resort, the Treasury would act.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="07121159000020">I cannot think of that as more distant from how we expect the fund to operate within the framework of the objectives which will be set up for it. Subordinate legislation will be established to guarantee that it is governed by the Financial Services Authority. But if, in the most extreme case, the body acted completely contrary to the objectives that it is meant to fulfil in its articles of government, then the Treasury would act. It is a private body and therefore the Treasury would not act through direct enforcement; it would have to present the case against the fund. The reclaim fund is independent of government&#151;it is a creation of the banks and the building societies&#151;but there is a clear indication in the Bill of its objectives and how it should distribute resources.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07121159000021">We will introduce secondary legislation to guarantee that the Financial Services Authority plays its proper part in the regulation of this body. Referral to the Treasury is a position of last resort in the relationship between the Treasury and that private body.

It is subject to the requirements of the Financial Services Authority for the prudent management of its moneys and resources. But if, in an extreme position, the body was acting quite contrary to the basis on which it was established, it would be necessary for the Treasury to act because the body will have been set up by an Act of Parliament to reach some clear public objectives.</p>

It would give a direction, and if the reclaim fund stayed obdurate in its position, that might lead to court action. I merely emphasise that we would have the public authority in conflict with a private body. That is a most unlikely occurrence, but had we not put this in the Bill and established the position of the Treasury in relation to the reclaim fund, noble Lords opposite would have been the first to ask what would be done if things went wrong with the fund&#146;s operation. The fund is a private body, but it fulfils some publicly defined purposes.</p>

The company will be incorporated under the Companies Acts, including the Companies Act 2006. I suppose it is perfectly possible that someone might proceed against the company on the ground that it was not conforming to those Acts. At that point, if it did get into court, someone would get up and say, &#147;Has the Treasury done its duty?&#148;&#151;that is, did it give this company a direction that might have put it right in a way that would have meant it did not get taken to court? The Treasury seems to be getting itself into a difficult position by looking to put itself in the shoes of normal legal processes.</p>

If he is saying that the Treasury might have to face some difficult days, I disavow that notion. I do not think that a body operating under the degree of public accountability applying to this one is likely to end up running so unacceptably counter to the public will that, after the Financial Services Authority has made judgments on it and it has not responded, it then finds itself with a direction from the Treasury that could lead to it being tested in a court of law. It is likely that a body whose origin was the banks and building societies seeking to remedy a problem which they had long had with dormant accounts and to bring those accounts into the public arena for the advantage of communities, will come into such a conflicting relationship with government as foreshadowed by the anxieties expressed today. However, we would be remiss if we had no answer to the question of what could be done if this body did depart almost totally from its objectives if the Government&#146;s response was only to shrug their shoulders. We cannot possibly be in that position, which is why this reserve power is here.</p>

Within that framework, the body will have the necessary regulation, although it might be thought that it is somewhat pejorative to think that the body would run into very significant difficulties in this area in any case.

The first is competence, and the Minister has indicated that there is every expectation that these people will be competent and that everything will be done properly and competently. He has no fears on that front. The other issue is how judgment is dealt with. It seems to me that, particularly in year one, the directors of the board will have to exercise incredible judgment about how generous or parsimonious they are. In year one, they will see whether many people endeavour to reclaim. Then there will be year two, and we will see accounts of what is happening year after year. Is the Minister concerned that the board, as judged by the Treasury, will be seen as too generous or too parsimonious? If we take the view that they cannot be other than competent, that is the only issue.</p>

The Treasury is not brought in at that level. We must face the prospect&#151;which is so distant that I seek to allay all concerns and not give to rise to them in this contribution, because it would suggest elements of bad faith&#151;that this body, which controls significant resources, fails in the most extreme circumstances to reach the objectives for which it was established. The most extreme example might be that the directors took almost every resource that they had in annual salary and fees, with nothing distributed, which is hugely unlikely. If such misbehaviour at that most extreme level occurred, it might be necessary for the Treasury to give direction about how the body should work within the original framework for which it was established. If we had no structure for enforcing compliance in that most extreme of all cases, we would be open to the charge that we were creating a body in which there was no public interest to be safeguarded.</p>

DBERR has various powers in cases where directors act in the extreme way that the Minister described. The activity of the reclaim fund will be brought under the Financial Services Authority, which has a number of powers.

I find it difficult to find anything that is much heavier handed than a Treasury direction. It is the complete reverse. A sledgehammer solution is being written into the Bill. We have pressed the Minister on what this is really about. The only example that has been given was first described as &#147;excessive costs&#148; and then described as &#147;directors&#146; remuneration&#148;.

The public authority must have the right to that sanction, but it is by no means a question of the Treasury giving direction to the body. We identify the body as being private and will defend the Bill on that basis. It is a judgment for the Office for National Statistics, and it is somewhat unlikely that it should be expected to make the judgment now before we have established the process.

<p><a name="07121159000045">The noble Baroness said: The amendment introduces a new clause after Clause 5 and sets out the obligations of the reclaim fund in relation to personal confidential information. Importantly, it sets out the offences that will be committed if personal information is disclosed. I am sure that the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will instantly recognise the amendment&#146;s formulation as it is government drafting and is lifted from the Statistics and Registration Service Act which we spent many happy hours debating earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="07121159000046">The British Bankers&#146; Association has suggested that as the banks will be acting as agents for the reclaim fund, the reclaim fund will need to have hardly any personal information at all. That does not seem entirely plausible given the repayment responsibilities of the reclaim fund. We heard in the Committee&#146;s first sitting how the banks would be calculating the amounts that the reclaim fund would have to repay and that the repayment amount could easily be more than the

I cannot see how a responsible reclaim fund can take instructions on the basis of barely any underlying documentation. The Bill creates no incentives for the banks to minimise the value of repayment claims, so the reclaim fund will have to take responsibility for the quantum of repayment claims and therefore have some way of carrying out checks and controls. That will inevitably involve confidential information.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0002.htm_para2">
<p><a name="07121159000047">The British Bankers&#146; Association has said that if there are disputes then the reclaim fund may need to have confidential information to settle those disputes. I rather suspect that, as we also discussed in our first sitting, disputes about charges and interest may not be that rare. I therefore believe that, in practice, the reclaim fund will decide that it has to have information, confidential personal information, simply in order to process repayments responsibly. I searched the Bill for protection for that information but, of course, found none. The reclaim fund will be subject to the Data Protection Act, which will provide limited cover where data are processed, but there is no provision in the Bill relating to the disclosure of confidential personal information and no specific offences relating to the misuse of information.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="07121159000048">As the Minister will be aware, when we think about organisations that handle personal information, we now all have in mind the horrendous loss of data at HM Revenue and Customs. The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 contains similar provisions to those in Amendment No. 22. The provisions of that Act did not stop HMRC staff being careless with personal information, but that is not a reason for not providing the legislative framework in my amendment.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0002.htm_para4">
<p><a name="07121159000049">I shall briefly outline the scheme under the new clause in Amendment No. 22. Subsection (1) says that the reclaim fund must not disclose personal information, and that applies to directors, employees, members of committees&#151;anyone who has received the information from the reclaim fund.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="07121159000050">Subsections (2) and (3) define personal information. Subsection (4) sets out the exemptions available, including exemptions for various legal purposes, exemptions to allow the reclaim fund to carry out its functions, and when an individual consents. Those are fairly standard exemptions. The crux of the clause is in subsection (5), which makes it a criminal offence to contravene the basic requirement not to disclose personal information, with only some limited defences in subsection (6).</p>

It has changed because of the actions of some government departments, but it is a fact of life that it has changed. We should not lose the opportunity to reinforce the importance of personal information in relation to this body which, while being created as a private body, as the Minister has said, is carrying out some sort of public function. It is important for the Treasury to have a power of direction over it, thereby indicating the public interest in the activities of the fund, and we ought to be treating it in the same way as we treat other bodies in the public sector that carry out public functions.

I have to say that I have considerable misgivings about it. Yesterday I moved amendments suggesting that the best way of finding the owners of dormant accounts would be to publish their names. That is likely to be far more fruitful than other means. It is true, of course, that the banks have apparently been actively promoting their free central tracing scheme&#151;at least, three of them&#151;and, indeed, have generally been hotting up the desire to try to find the owners of dormant accounts. In some of the representations I have received, it is said that the banks have received unprecedented volumes of claims and inquiries, which suggests that they were not actually pursuing the matter very enthusiastically before. I do not think that merely going along the road they are taking now is likely to find as many owners of dormant accounts as could be found by the process that I described yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="07121159000053">The difficulty is that it involves publishing names. As I said yesterday, I have not in my experience in a different context found any problem with that. There is also the question&#151;I am now relating directly to the amendment&#151;of what happens when the money not having been found by the banks ends up in the reclaim fund. I understand that it is still possible, and it is the intention that it should be possible, for people to claim against the reclaim fund. I presume that that means the individual will have to apply, but unless they know there is an account in a particular name, they will not be able to do so, other than the shotgun effect of everyone writing in saying, &#147;It is my money&#148;. I hope that this will be done at the first stage, but even so it is likely that it will have to be done at the second stage once the unclaimed money arrives in the reclaim account.</p>

It is essential that the names be revealed, both at the first stage&#151;when, it is to be hoped, it will clear many of the accounts&#151;and at the second stage. </p>

<p><a name="07121159000056">The problem is that the banks are thinking all the time in terms of customers, but some of these accounts have been dormant for a very long time and the customers have probably long since died. The accounts, therefore, are likely to remain for a long while. But there is, none the less, a legitimate claim against the account by the heirs of the person who has died. They will not know that they are able to claim, or that there is an account against which they can claim, unless they know that great aunt Sally, unbeknown to them, had an account with this or that bank, or subsequently with the reclaim fund. Therefore, while we want to preserve confidentiality on all the details, identification is necessary.

Is this a public-sector or a private-sector body? I think the noble Baroness used the phrase &#147;public functions in the public sector&#148;, which is why she wanted this public-sector wording. But if this is a private-sector company, it seems strange to put in wording that relates to public bodies. I would have thought that if, as the Government claim, this is a private-sector body, the logical place to start would be the <I>Banking Code</I>, which carefully states:</p>

I hope that it will be possible through the reclaim fund to identify people who have dormant accounts&#151;we would need a provision in the Bill to that effect&#151;but that would be covered under this provision of the <I>Banking Code</I> if the reclaim fund adopted the code. This is just another example of a lack of clarity in our minds. It is difficult to know whether this is a public body or a private body. If it is a public body in every respect, let us treat it like one; if it is not, let us not do so. The slight problem with the amendment is that it treats the reclaim fund as a public body although we have been told by the Government that it is not.</p>

Surely the first task is to do everything we can by transparent means to make sure that the resources get to where the person who originally owned them intended.

One way in which the reclaim fund could work is for the bank to scour its position and decide, &#147;Well, there is &#163;25 million. We will send a cheque to the reclaim fund&#148;. All the reclaim fund will know is that it has got &#163;25 million&#151;and that is it. If people pop up later and say to the bank, &#147;Just a minute, we&#146;ve got &#163;10,000; we&#146;ve found the passbook in the attic&#148;, does the bank say, &#147;That&#146;s part of the &#163;25 million&#148;? Is that how it is going to work? It will not be the reclaim fund that deals with that person but the bank.

<p><a name="07121169000006">I accept what the noble Baroness says about the importance of the protection of personal information.

They are already doing it, although the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said that that may be a contrast with the recent past. I pass no comment on that. I think we should welcome the banks&#146; and building societies&#146; commitment to that additional activity and to making sure that rightful account holders can repossess their money.</p>

<p><a name="07121169000009">The banks and building societies will be the agents for this work. As the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, indicated, the reclaim fund will be concerned with the distribution of the resources that flow into it as a result of the judgments of the banks about funds in dormant accounts. The reclaim fund will not be involved in those judgments. The banks and building societies will do that in the recognition that there is a public obligation, and their public accounts will reflect how much they are transferring to this fund. There will potentially be a situation where a claim is contested and the reclaim fund will have to inform itself of the justice of the case. It would need that information then. The noble Baroness does not need the great artifice of the bespoke public protection she seeks to insert into the Bill, as the Data Protection Act will already guarantee that. In any case, we are talking about a body that will have very little information about these accounts at its disposal. The banks and building societies, as agents to the reclaim fund, will be responsible for delivering accuracy.</p>

There would still be a remnant that it was processing, and it may well be that if it had a late claim it might be able to match off the remnants with the late claim so that there would not be recourse to the reclaim fund.</p>

The way in which the banks organise the necessary transfer of resources is a matter for them. It will be appreciated that there will be public scrutiny of what banks are doing and of the funds that go to the reclaim fund. We expect the banks and the reclaim fund to act prudently, so they must have the resources to match potential claims. They will have some perspective on the percentage. Awareness will grow over time, and the amount that it will be necessary to hold in reserve against a successful claim way beyond the 15 years will reduce over time. However, in the early stages they will act prudently and make sure that they have covered themselves. The Government hesitate to be too precise about what the figures might realise because the banks and building societies have given very loose estimates of what would be released from their resources.</p>

My understanding of the situation&#151;I hope the Minister will say whether I am correct&#151;is that the banks would seek to find the owners of dormant accounts and, having failed to do so, would transfer the money to the reclaim fund. None the less, there is provision in the Bill as I understand it for someone who thinks they have a claim against a bank but failed to make it for one reason or another to make it against the reclaim fund. However, the Minister has just said, &#147;Ah, but that will be dealt with by the banks acting as agents for the reclaim fund&#148;. That is what I understood him to say.</p>

<p><a name="07121169000013">One is always worried that the parliamentary draftsman might have a nervous breakdown, or perhaps has had one, but, in this case, I am concerned about the use of the words &#147;reclaim fund&#148;. Whatever happens, the money is not being reclaimed from the reclaim fund; it is being reclaimed ex post from the bank. Have I understood what the Government intend&#151;that it goes from the bank to the reclaim fund and that no information at all, apart from the total amount or perhaps the individual amounts, will go from the bank to the reclaim fund? In that case my noble friend&#146;s amendment would be redundant at this stage because the fund does not have any information on which to break confidentiality. But that is not what I thought was happening. I thought that the reclaim fund was going to deal with the individuals who had not previously claimed from the banks.</p>

In a contested claim where the individual has applied to the bank but has not, so far as they are concerned, got a proper decision and the bank says, &#147;That is because we have decided that the account is dormant and resources have been transferred to the reclaim fund&#148;, the reclaim fund would potentially, if the individual were persistent, then entertain a representation from the individual on the justice of their claim. The fund would then have to get the necessary information from the bank. How confidential that information would be is the noble Baroness&#146;s proper concern. I was seeking to suggest to the Committee that the reason the amendment was otiose is that we have proper data protection regulation in place to guarantee the security of that information.</p>

<p><a name="07121169000015">I repeat that the position the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, identified&#151;that it is the banks and building societies that are the main actors in respect of the identification of claims and the response to them&#151;persists. That is the concept under which we are operating, and therefore the amount of information in the hands of the reclaim fund is necessarily very limited.</p>

However, the scheme says the banks will pass dormant account money over to the fund and will then tell it when the bank thinks a repayment is due, which may or may not be the same amount as originally handed over. That scheme cannot effectively operate within the reclaim fund as a proper basis for it to spend money on repayment. The fund should have records of which dormant account money it has taken over, so that when an amount is repaid it can knock that off the list. The fund cannot simply hand over all record-keeping to banks and trust anything that a bank gives to it at a later stage about what that bank thinks should be repaid. If the reclaim fund is to be a responsible body in relation to the money it has to keep back for repayments, it is inevitable that it has to have information&#151;otherwise it can never validate what it is being asked to repay. While the scheme sounds quite nice, with the banks handling the information, how does the reclaim fund check that information before paying? It seems to me that the fund has duties.</p>

Let us get back to basics. The customer, member or whatever has a relationship with his bank or building society and he has nothing to do with any reclaim fund&#151;that comes later. Therefore, if a person unearths a pass book in an attic, he should go to his bank and say, &#147;I want my &#163;10,000. Here&#146;s the book. It got lost 40 years ago but here it is&#148;. I do not see that he should be troubled with going anywhere near the reclaim fund. Surely that is why the fund exists. In one sense, the fund is an insurance policy and, in effect, the bank or building society is saying, &#147;We&#146;re claiming on our insurance policy by going to the reclaim fund&#148;.</p>

The fund does not need the personal details of bank accounts and therefore it does not need the safeguard contained in the amendment. The identity resource contained within the individual bank account is the responsibility of the bank or building society, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, so graphically illustrated, it is to the bank or building society that the customer will inevitably go. Those running the fund will certainly need to know how much money is in the account and the potential interest rate because they will be holding that money and a claim may come in that they have to meet. Therefore, as the noble Baroness rightly indicated, the size of the claim will dictate the level of resources that the reclaim fund has at its disposal, but it will not hold personal information. In that sense, the banks have an agency role and there will be an agreement between them and the fund on how things operate. However, the banks and building societies will retain the crucial information, the confidentiality of which is addressed by the amendment.</p>

We expect dormant accounts to be exactly what they are categorised as being; that is, dormant accounts on which future claims will not obtain in the vast majority of cases. That is why their resources can properly be directed towards the objectives that the Bill identifies. It would be a foolish bank or building society that did not have any resource to cover itself against a potentially successful claim.

One way or another, the Treasury will look like a natural port of call. I do not believe that that could be a problem in the early years when the backlog of dormant account money is transferred to the reclaim fund. Reserving policy will be largely immaterial when there are significant inward flows, but the issue will become highly relevant once the backlog is cleared and the amounts flowing in annually have dropped to the much lower level.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="07121169000042">The Minister himself has pointed out that the sums available for transfer to the Big Lottery Fund and transferred to the reclaim fund as liabilities will depend on how successful the reuniting activities are. As we know, the charities are very keen to ensure that reuniting activities are better than they have been in the past. It is just possible that, if that is successful, the amount of dormant account money declared for transfer via the reclaim fund in future will drop down to a significantly lower level. In some ways that would indicate the success of the policy, but it would not necessarily indicate success in getting money to the Big Lottery Fund. So if the reclaim fund did not set aside enough money when the money was flowing in, possibly because pressure was put on it to release as much as possible for good causes, we might find that the ongoing annual inflows were not enough to fund the ongoing demands for repayment, especially as the repayments may well be much higher than the amounts originally handed over. As we also know, interest may well be added on to those figures, which will increase the amount that has to be repaid.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000001">If we assume that about &#163;500 million flows in in the first few years, in line with the figures quoted by the BBA and the BSA, and that the annual flow then drops down to &#163;10 million annually, which is broadly what the BBA has suggested, an error of only 2 per cent in the reclaim fund&#146;s reserving policy would use up the whole of a year&#146;s inflow. If those inflows were actually lower due to more successful reuniting, the ongoing cash problems could become severe. It is therefore not a fantasy amendment: this is something that could happen down the line because not enough was kept back when large amounts flowed into the fund.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000002">I understand that the reclaim fund will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme so that any unpaid repayment claims could eventually be recovered within the terms of that scheme. That raises two sorts of problem. First, the cost of the compensation scheme is met by the whole financial services industry. The Minister will be aware that there is currently considerable controversy about how the costs of the compensation scheme are borne. Asking the whole of the financial services sector to underwrite the potential costs of over-distribution of dormant account money via the Big Lottery Fund would at the very best be unpopular. Secondly, the compensation scheme presently covers only &#163;35,000. The Government are consulting on proposals to increase that to &#163;100,000 but, as the Minister will also know, that proposal is itself not without controversy. Only last week, the British Bankers&#146; Association voiced considerable opposition to that proposition.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="07121170000003">Whatever the compensation limit is set at, the Bill imposes on an account holder the possibility that the strength of his covenant will be weakened. If I had a dormant account with, say, Barclays, I would not worry unduly about the compensation scheme terms or limits because I would see the strength of the Barclays balance sheet as my main security. The reclaim fund is quite a different proposition. If my dormant account money went via the reclaim fund, the Bill would give me the covenant of the reclaim fund, which would operate on completely separate financial dynamics. I am not at all sure how the Government have managed to convince themselves that the loss of security entailed in going into a much smaller and weaker organisation does not breach Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07121170000004">I do not like Treasury guarantees any more than the Government, but the Treasury has created this scheme and it cannot simply turn its back on how the scheme works out in practice. Even if there is not an explicit Treasury guarantee, will there not be an implicit guarantee because of the existence, if not the use, of the Treasury&#146;s powers of direction? So, I ask again: what happens if the reclaim fund runs out of money? I beg to move.</p>

This gets back to the question of whether this is a private or a public scheme. If it is a public sector scheme, perhaps the Treasury should be doing as the noble Baroness suggests. However, under the Government&#146;s current model, this is a private company and voluntary scheme. If it runs into difficulties, the people who should be sorting it out are those who are responsible for it&#151;namely, the banks and building societies. Under the current model, as I understand it, they will appoint the directors of this body and they must take some responsibility. If the reclaim fund ran into difficulty, I do not see why the banks and building societies could not make an additional payment into the reclaim fund as an advance on payments that they would be due to make in forthcoming years. The poor old Big Lottery Fund would then be starved of funds while this got sorted out, but that would be a logical way of dealing with the matter. The only exception

<a name="71211-gc0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07121170000006">All this demonstrates that what looks like a simple scheme is much more complicated than it first appears. Although it will depend to some extent on what the Minister says in this case, the examples that we had in previous amendments do not satisfy me that the Government, in consultation with banks and building societies, which seem to be driving a lot of this, have thought out many of the details of how some of these problems will be dealt with.</p>

<ul><a name="07121170000099">&#147;the customer has against the reclaim fund whatever right to payment of the balance the customer would have against the bank or building society if the transfer had not happened&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="07121170000089">If I am reading the Bill correctly, it transfers the contractual obligation from the bank or building society to the reclaim fund. My noble friend argued that that lessens the security of anyone who originally had a claim against a bank or building society but now has a claim against the reclaim fund. We need an explanation of why the Treasury has chosen to transfer the contractual obligation from the banks and building societies to the reclaim fund. The obligation could have been left in the original contract with the bank or building society and, as has been suggested before, the reclaim fund could have been made an agent that holds the money and sends it back to the bank or building society only if the bank or building society says that it has found that the contract still applies and that it has to make a repayment. The bank or building society would trust that the reclaim fund had kept enough money to meet the repayments, which we all know are bound to happen. That is not the way the Bill has gone; it has transferred the contractual obligation from the original holder of the debt to the reclaim fund.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000009">I am extremely unhappy about the Big Lottery Fund spending all this money. I will be coming to this when we deal with the question of the social investment bank. This will be a one-time splurge of money that may possibly substitute even taxpayers&#146; funds and, if it does not do that, it will be other lottery funds&#151;if it is neither of those it will be very surprising. At the end of this spending, when the money starts to run out, people will ask whether any is left in the reclaim fund. There will be enormous public pressure to spend down any reserves that that fund has. The people who run the fund may responsibly say that they are going to keep quite a large sum of money in case there are later claims. But the pressure will be there, and we know that political life is such that, when the heat comes on,

<p><a name="07121170000010">Therefore, ultimately the Treasury, rather like the Northern Rock example, will find itself paying up anyway, so it might as well give that guarantee. I share my noble friend&#146;s reservations about Treasury guarantees on anything, but we are not talking about inordinate sums of money in Treasury terms. If the fund is sensibly run, this should never arise anyway. I do not believe that the Treasury would be putting its head in a very big noose by undertaking to do this; it would be a more sensible way of seeing the matter through.</p>

It is a probing amendment, so when the noble Lord, Lord Newby, accuses the noble Baroness of wanting this to happen, I say to him, &#147;Just hang on a moment&#148;, as I do not think that that is what she is suggesting. She is pointing out, justifiably, a potential problem that might arise. I say &#147;might arise&#148; because we think it highly unlikely that the reclaim fund will become insolvent.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000012">In answer to the question posed by the noble Baroness, the best that I can do this afternoon is to point out something that she said to my noble friend on the first amendment that we discussed today&#151;that seems a long time ago now. She said that the reclaim fund&#146;s activities will be brought under the scope of FSA regulation. The Bill requires a reclaim fund to be authorised by the FSA, and it amends the relevant primary legislation to enable the activities of a reclaim fund to be specified as regulated activities. The Government will also amend the relevant society secondary legislation&#151;the regulated activities order&#151;following the enactment of the Bill, which will bring the reclaim fund within the scope of FSA regulation.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07121170000013">We believe that that provides satisfactory checks and balances to ensure that consumers are protected in relation to this matter. What are those checks and balances? First, the FSA will be able to apply regulation to the reclaim fund so that it manages the assets prudently and is able to repay dormant account holders who come forward to reclaim their money. We think that that goes a long way to safeguarding the interests of consumers. Further, FSA regulation will enable claims against the reclaim fund to be brought under the coverage of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, mentioned earlier this afternoon, subject to its meeting the usual qualification criteria and once necessary amendments have been made to the scheme rules. Therefore, we do not believe that it would be appropriate or necessary for the Government to take on the liability for repaying consumers, given the framework that we are trying to establish in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000014">I said that it was highly unlikely that the reclaim fund would become insolvent. If that were to happen, as I said, customers would be able to claim compensation from the FSCS so long as the reclaim fund remained authorised by the FSA, subject to meeting the usual

The FSA would consult on the detailed rules in relation to the FSCS and its cover in the usual way. In practice, we would expect a successor fund to be set up by the private sector to take on existing customer liabilities. Here, I hark back to what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said in his contribution&#151;this is a private sector organisation. Our view is that it would be best as a private sector organisation: it would have the expertise to manage these matters effectively. We would expect a successor fund to be set up by the private sector to take on the existing customers&#146; liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000015">The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom, asked why we are doing it this way round. We are taking liability away from the banks and building societies because that will ensure that those institutions do not suffer an adverse impact on their balance sheets as a result of the scheme that will&#151;with general support, we hope&#151;be set up. It will allow financial institutions to transfer money from the dormant accounts into the scheme, while removing the corresponding liabilities that lie, as I understand it, on the balance sheets of the banks and building societies. That is why we have done it this way round. I have no doubt that we will return to that issue ere long.</p>

Organisations that are subject to FSA regulation generally have rules about how much capital they have to keep. Is it intended that the reclaim fund will be capitalised with a level of prudential capital so that there is a shareholder-funds hit first, or will reclaimed money be reserved? That makes a difference to the view one takes on how secure the scheme is.</p>

The precise detail of the regulatory regime will be a matter for the FSA; it will not be a matter for us. The FSA will consult on the detail of its regime following Royal Assent.

If the banks are to set up and promote this company, there must be some idea of whether it will have capital. I have not seen anything written about capital, so I suspect that it will not have it, and that makes a big difference to whether it will ever run out of money. If it does not have a shareholders&#146; equity buffer to take the first bit of pain, it is rather more important that we look at the potential consequences of the money running out.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000029">I think we agree that the ideal outcome is not that the reclaim fund will have a huge amount of money to hand on to the Big Lottery Fund but that the people who own the money will get their hands on it. The amendment seeks to make that easier. It includes provisions to create a scheme to help reunite people with what is rightfully theirs. It calls for the creation of a register that identifies unclaimed assets held by banks and building societies and allows members of the public to search for data to reclaim their lost assets. Crucially, such a scheme would allow charities, as well as relatives, to identify unclaimed assets from deceased people&#146;s estates.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07121170000030">For that to be possible, members of the public and charities must, in the first instance, be able to search a database with minimal information.

<p><a name="07121170000031">In the case of the estates of deceased people, information about the financial institution in which the asset is held is likely to be unknown; hence the difficulty in utilising some existing schemes where it is necessary to approach an individual bank or building society.

As currently drafted, the Bill would not compel financial institutions to make data more easily accessible to the general public; banks and building societies will simply be asked to publicise the fact that they hold unclaimed assets.

This was set up in 2000 and, at the moment, companies from the life assurance, pensions and unit trust sectors supply the UAR with records of customers

That is a substantial sum, particularly given that when the scheme was established no banks were members of it. The Charity Bank joined it in 2003 and in July 2007 HBOS announced that to help in tracing its dormant customers, it, too, was signing up to the UAR. Charity Bank believes that this model could form the basis of a national register that is easily capable of being searched by individuals, companies and charities.</p>

<p><a name="07121170000035">The Commission on Unclaimed Assets has also considered this proposal and outlined two possible models in its report entitled <I>Unclaimed Assets: Consumer Protection and Regulation of Dormant Accounts</I>. One is, broadly speaking, along the lines that I have just described and the lines that the Unclaimed Assets Register follows&#151; namely, that there would be a single national register containing basic information such as name, date of birth and, possibly, last known address. The other option that the CUA looked at would be to allow an individual to interrogate databases of dormant assets held within each financial institution. Either of those two models is possible but, in terms of ease of getting an answer, the first is probably better.

The US has a number of examples of this. It is extraordinary that the US, which we tend not to consider to be at the forefront of innovative thinking in this area, has been able to manage systems like this for some time and to deal with problems as they have arisen; the systems seem robust.</p>

It is really a question of whether there is a case for amalgamating the data. I suggested that each individual bank should publish the list of the dormant account holders or perhaps subsequently the reclaim fund would do so; he is suggesting that the whole lot should be amalgamated. I suspect that would make the process quite difficult, even electronically.</p>

Other than that, I understand very well the arguments put forward by the noble Lord.

I had assumed up to now that the advantage for the charities would be that as much money as possible would be put into the reclaim fund and then distributed. But that raises a distribution issue and I understand now the point being made. If an individual died and left a dormant account with &#163;10 million in it to a particular charity, that charity might prefer to have the money than seeing the whole lot going into the general fund and having to rely on the lottery to allocate it.

That makes all the difference to that small charity in their running costs for the coming year or for a project that it wants to undertake. The advantage of a central register, however it is held, is that small charities would also be able to cross-check when there is just a will and no relatives and no one has any idea of where the accounts are, rather than having to trawl all the places where they might be. From the perspective of a small charity, this amendment is particularly appealing and the major charities also support it, as the right reverend Prelate said.</p>

I understood that there will be an initial release of money, but there are people who die who have squirreled money away and have not touched it for 30, 40 or 50 years. That money would be in those inactive accounts. The major beneficiary of Marie Curie Cancer Care was suddenly found to be very wealthy. The money had been sitting there untouched by and unknown to anyone for many years. It had all been squirreled away and was quietly gathering interest. I do not think that charities&#151;certainly not the small ones&#151;will be going back year on year to see whether 15 years has expired. This central register will become even more important in the initial release of these funds than it may be later, with time.

Are we envisaging a non-executive board and a non-executive chairman? Are we talking about a paid chief executive? How much will he be paid? Will all the non-executives be paid? How many people do we envisage will be needed to keep the organisation running? We need to have a picture of that before talking with any authority on the question of expenses, and so forth. I do not know who will control all of that. If the board decides how much it will be paid, we have seen what has happened elsewhere on that. Somehow there is an escalation; a consultant comes in and compares you with all sorts of other people around the world and says that you should be paid enormous sums. How will there be a limit on that? How can it be kept within reasonable limits?</p>

As we are talking about a body that is being set up to achieve goals to which we all subscribe&#151;to deal with money that it does not own, for which its owners cannot be located, and one that will have to work in the full glare of public accountability&#151;I should have thought it entirely reasonable for the Government to make it clear that they expect very high standards from the company, which should have due regard to the issue of reasonable costs. I shall not define them here; that would be asking too much of a body that is to be developed by the private sector. It seems to me entirely reasonable that we should seek to establish that this body will work within reasonably tight and responsible parameters. It has not been established whether the company will be limited by shares or by guarantee. The Bill is not prescriptive on that point, and I am not sure that the noble Baroness would expect it to be prescriptive about the creation of the private company in those terms. However, it is clear that we want to be sure that the company will act for the purposes identified in the Bill, using money from the dormant accounts for the public benefits identified.</p>

What is reasonable will be a matter for the directors and members to decide but, ultimately, it will be a transparent organisation operating with great concern for the public interest. As I indicated earlier&#151;although I do not want to go back over that ground again&#151;the Treasury would have a reserve power if an outrageous position developed. Noble Lords opposite, including the noble Baroness, said that this power was scarcely necessary because the company would act responsibly, so I do not have to re-emphasise that point now. I have no doubt that the company will follow a proper model of responsibility. However, due to the unique significance of this company, we want to emphasise that it is there to manage a scheme of resources which are not its own but are dormant accounts where it is not possible to locate the owners. The resources are directed towards the benefit of the wider public and it is only right that we should be concerned that the costs of the company are kept within reasonable parameters.</p>

Here the Bill is straining at the gnat of what expenses are to be paid to employees of the company but no reference is made to their salaries. In most companies the salaries are inordinately larger than any expenses that might be claimed. We are worrying about whether reasonable expenses are paid, but why are we not more concerned about reasonable salaries being paid?</p>

Am I right in thinking that under the provisions of the Bill, if my noble friend Lord Hamilton and I both went to Companies House, we could both now register a company as a reclaim fund? If there is no particular arrangement in the Bill about who is to form the company under the Companies Act, I assume&#151;because the Bill refers to &#147;reclaim funds&#148; and not to one &#147;reclaim fund&#148;&#151;that we could register a company, set out articles of association and a memorandum and seek to become the company in control of the reclaim funds. If that is not the case, the question must be: who has agreed with the Treasury that when the Bill is enacted they will be willing to promote a reclaim fund?</p>

We cannot give effect to this legislation until we have secondary legislation that brings the company within the framework of the Financial Services Authority.

The private sector is eager to make progress on a problem that it has not solved in the past and on which it wants to make better progress in future. Public interest in the scheme is so great because the resources are not being directed towards private gain but to public gain. Within this framework we are not creating a statutory body controlled by the Government&#151;I have been at pains to emphasise that it is not a public body&#151;and therefore we would not expect the same degree of prescription in legislation as we would if we were creating something which was directly under government auspices.</p>

We are told that it is to have a power of direction from the Treasury, which is extremely unusual. We are then told that its articles have to have a provision about reasonableness of expenditure, which, as far as I am aware, has never been included in the articles of a limited company. Certainly I have never come across one. We are trying to find out how this will work in practice. The Minister said that that is a matter for the directors and members. We asked about the directors and members and got no answers. We do not know who the directors or the members are because the Minister is not sharing any of that with us.</p>

He will not tell us how this will work out in practice. What is the balance of rights and responsibilities as between the owners of the shares, the Treasury and the management? These are important issues for the practical working of this body. I am coming to the conclusion that a Companies Act company is the wrong model for this body.

<p><a name="07121184000173">Articles of most ordinary companies&#151;this is not an ordinary company&#151;allow them to borrow money. My amendment is designed to tease out the Government&#146;s views on the appropriateness of that. We have already debated what happens if the reclaim fund runs out of money. One solution might be that it could borrow money until it got some more in. I think the noble Lord, Lord Newby, thought that the fund could effectively borrow from the banks until it received some money. That would seem potentially quite convenient.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07121184000015">But my amendment raises a broader question about the prudential management of a reclaim fund. Under Clause 5(1), the reclaim fund will have to hold back funds in order to meet repayment claims. In practical terms, it will invest those moneys; it will not just leave them sitting there on deposit. The reclaim fund will need a proportion in a realisable form but I imagine that it will be investing in a range of things. Perhaps the Minister can explain that. Those investments will have decreasing levels of liquidity depending on what is chosen for the investments. This could range from quoted securities, which in most ordinary circumstances are readily realisable, through to, say, property, which is not readily realisable. If the fund does not have sufficient liquid funds it might be convenient for it to have a small overdraft to tide itself over until it can realise funds to meet repayment claims.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07121184000016">My problem is that borrowing powers are a bit of a slippery slope. Once you have created a borrowing power&#151;and the Bill does not prevent borrowing powers&#151;what would stop the reclaim fund from borrowing to invest in the mistaken belief that it could somehow increase the resources available for good causes? What would stop it borrowing against future dormant account money so that it could, perhaps under pressure from the Government, distribute money ahead of having it available on normal reserve principles? What would stop the reclaim fund taking risks, in one way or another, either with its investment policy or with the way that it fed money out to good causes?</p>

<a name="71211-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="07121184000017">The fund is intended to be a non-profit organisation. I am generally cautious about such organisations having borrowing powers because they tend to be non-commercial organisations and probably handle risks less well than commercial organisations. I am interested to hear whether the Government think that the reclaim fund is at the non-profit end of the spectrum, which typically has no borrowing powers, or at the company end which has extensive borrowing powers. In considering whether the reclaim fund should be allowed to borrow money, the issue of whether or not it has any equity capital as a kind of shareholders&#146; funds buffer against things going wrong is also important. This is a probing amendment to find out what the Government think. I beg to move.</p>

Whatever organisation is operating, it is unusual for it not to have some form of overdraft facility. It is often a question of smoothing flows of money. If the reclaim fund can be confident that money is coming in, there is nothing particularly pernicious about borrowing against a serious demand

If it did not have that power, it would find itself extremely restricted. Inflows of money are liable to take a very regular form. The fund may well have made commitments to people who are going to give it money, and it might find that it could not meet them in the timescale those clients were looking for.

It has to set up systems and employ people to operate them in advance of any money coming from the banks and building societies from dormant accounts. Will we have more details about the company before we get to the further stages of the Bill? Without such details, it is extremely difficult to judge whether the scheme is sound.</p>

The Government think that a body carrying this degree of responsibility should have some constraints of that kind placed upon it in legislation. A moment later she is suggesting that the body should have no rights at all to borrow that and there can be no conceivable circumstances in which it should have the opportunity to do so.

That is excellent; the one thing financial accounts are not is put out as soon as possible.

It is clear that when its authors put it out they had not even read the Bill; they said the new body would be independent of government, but the Bill has a Treasury direction for it. So we know that the BBA were behind the pace. We do not understand how the body&#146;s independence of the BBA and the BSA will work, because the Government will not tell us who the owners are.

Putting early information out about the reclaim fund is part of public accountability about what the fund is doing with the money. It is not a huge or onerous requirement, but it ensures that some information gets into the public domain before it is sneaked into Companies House with no fanfare after nine months. This asks for more early information.</p>

Surely they have something in mind. I would have thought that the simplest thing would be for a company to be founded that was owned, either through shares or by guarantee, by those two bodies or by the various banks and building societies that joined the scheme. Or are they looking for Ladbrokes or Richard Branson to form a company and offer it up? Surely there must be some idea of what is in mind for this company?</p>

There is no specification of how publication is to be made. Is it to be sent to people or advertised? Is it just to be sneaked on to a website without any publicity? There is a lacuna at the moment regarding what should be done about publication.

All the issues that surround it have been debated at great length. It is no use asking the Government who the shareholders and the directors will be, or anything like that, because they have not the faintest clue. When I was an innocent in the ways of a reclaim fund, it seemed to me logical that since it was being set up by the Government, they might want to have some part in appointing the directors to it. Given the Government&#146;s role, including government nominees on the board seems at least worth considering, even if they were a minority. However, I am sure that the Minister will be unable to give me any more information than he already has in answer to questions about directors raised by the noble Baroness and other noble Lords. Therefore, I see no purpose in spending longer on the amendment but to say that if he has found in the past hour any new information which would shed light on that issue, I would be very grateful for it.

It is perhaps my own fault for not having got involved in this matter earlier. As I said yesterday, I was appointed to the system which operated in Switzerland. I was just rereading the advertisement which asked people who had possible dormant accounts to come forward. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121184000194">&#147;Today ... the Swiss Bankers Association is publishing the list of all known ... dormant accounts&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121184000177">and so on. It continued:</p>
<ul><a name="07121184000201">&#147;This initiative will be administered by an international board of trustees and supervised by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission and the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons ... chaired by Paul Volcker&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121184000178">So far as I can recall, there was no government involvement whatever, and I am beginning to wonder why we have this legislation. I am 100 per cent in favour of the objectives of uniting the accounts with their owners on the one hand and the money being made available for charitable purposes on the other. However, I am  


<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"><b>11 Dec 2007 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>beginning to wonder whether the Government feel somehow that arranging it in this way will mean that some credit will fall on them because of the charitable purposes aspect. One of the concluding paragraphs in the advertisement that I have just quoted reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121184000195">&#147;The Swiss banks are committed to using unclaimed ... funds for humanitarian or charitable purposes&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121184000179">which indeed was the case. So I begin to wonder whether it is necessary to set out in detail in the legislation how the fund is to be set up, what the basis of it should be and so on. On the other hand, Schedule 1 spells out a number of bits of information without in any sense being comprehensive, and the debates that we have just had deal with the issues piecemeal.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="07121184000085">As I said, I begin to doubt whether the objectives cannot be fulfilled otherwise. If we are to go down the legislative route, I hope that between now and Report we can come up with a schedule that spells out all the points that have been picked up in the debates over the past hour or so. I do not think that you can have a schedule setting out odd bits here and there but omitting other important points.</p>

I can see that there might be a case for some government nominees, given the public nature of this issue. However, I think that the main purpose of the amendment is to probe what is happening so that we can be satisfied that it is acceptable, and therefore I support it to that extent.</p>

However, it was the noble Lord who emphasised in debate on earlier amendments yesterday that this was to be a private sector company. The Government could have attempted to set up a public sector company or some sort of hybrid company, but this will be a private sector company set up by the organisations to which I have referred.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para6">
<p><a name="07121184000088">The Bill seeks to set some sort of constraint around that company so that the public can be satisfied that it will be prudently run and that it will come under FSA rules and regulations. However, I do not consider fair the criticism that suggests that somehow the Government should know exactly what kind of company this will be&#151;that is, whether it will be a company limited by guarantee or by shares. The point is that it will be a private sector company, and we hope that the terms of the Bill mean that it will act effectively to do the sort of things for which noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, have been arguing for many years. So, in my view, attacking the Government for not knowing every detail about how the company is to be set up is a good subject for debate but it does not really go to the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter is that we need to see the scheme set up.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000091">The heart of the question put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, with his vast experience, was: why do we need government legislation at all? Frankly, we need the legislation in order for banks to be able to cancel their liabilities to customers in the first place when they transfer their money. If we did not pass this legislation, there would be no way in which banks could cancel their liabilities to customers, and they would then keep those liabilities on their balance sheets while losing the assets. At heart, that is why we need the legislation.</p>

The Minister said that we were criticising the Government for not giving every detail about the scheme, but our complaint is that we are not getting any detail about how the scheme will work in practice.

It seems to me that there is an asymmetry in the Bill. The Government talk about a light touch but it must be the lightest touch possible. In fact, if there has been a touch at all in terms of how the company will operate, we have yet to see it. However, the Bill is pretty prescriptive with regard to how the money is spent. We do not mind if there is a light touch on how the scheme operates&#151;it is up to the banks and building societies to get the cash in&#151;but, my word, once the cash comes in, we are very keen to be prescriptive about how it is spent.</p>

However, as I said when introducing it, this is a probing amendment and I beg leave to withdraw it.</p>

In her opening remarks, my noble friend Lady Noakes said that there were many respects in which we thought the Bill needed to be widened. In a sense, the purpose of this amendment is to avoid doubt because it relates to Clause 7, which is concerned with the definition of &#147;bank&#148;. The question is whether the Bill will cover, and whether the participants will include, National Savings &amp; Investments. In my view, it certainly should. It would be bizarre if the clearing banks and building societies disposed of their dormant accounts but the National Savings Bank did not.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000102">Members of the Committee will note that I use the expression, &#147;National Savings Bank&#148;. It is a little over 35 years since I suddenly found myself the Minister responsible for national savings. It was the heyday of savings; the savings ratio then was something for which the present Chancellor would be green with envy. In the aftermath of, &#147;You have never had it so good&#148;, and Harold Macmillan, ERNIE&#151;the system of premium bonds introduced by him&#151;was so successful that I had to go to somewhere near Blackpool to set off a new number-generating machine because the first one could not cope with the number of donations to national savings.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="07121184000103">I also had to go to Glasgow to look round the national savings establishment there. What most impressed me, and indeed, which they impressed on me, was the extent of the dormant accounts. I presume that there is an even greater number now in the national savings arrangements. Clearly, if we were to distribute these to their rightful owners, we would have to set some de minimis amount, as some of the amounts involved are very small indeed. The reason for arguing that it be included in the Bill is that it is operated as a bank. I will not say who the owner is&#151;it is not me. I have discovered a Post Office Savings Bank book, which clearly describes the system as a bank. It is possible to make deposits, withdrawals, have cheques made out, and so on. It also pays interest at one ha&#146;penny per &#163;1 for each complete calendar month. Clearly, it operates as a bank, paying a rather better rate of interest than NatWest now pays on my current account.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07121184000104">It was a good system. You could buy government stocks, take out annuities, and so on. At all events, it was clearly a bank. As I said, a de minimis amount would probably have to be fixed, but the rightful owners ought to be informed and attempts to trace them made. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the system will include that in the arrangements for reuniting people, and if necessary, pass on the assets to the reclaim fund.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07121184000107">I have been here in this very Room previously, when considering the Northern Ireland budget. We have finance debates about every six months, and I spotted that there was an organisation called Ulster Savings, which was clearly specific to Northern Ireland. It had b8een decided to close that scheme down. Every six months, I raised with various Ministers the question of the residual orphan funds left in Ulster Savings. I was told several times that I was just a bit too soon. They were still looking at it and, although there were no staff left in Ulster Savings, they thought there might still be people knocking at the door and were not quite ready. On the final occasion, they were moving off the accounts and all we got were the previous year&#146;s figures, and there was nothing for that year. I raised the subject again, and ultimately I got a letter saying that the funds had already been spent on the people and were not available.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07121184000108">I understand that argument, but the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was referring to the fact that the Government are halfway in&#151;it is hokey-cokey. They are going to put the National Savings and Investments funds in the reuniting campaign and they may be reunited, but they are not going to be available for the main scheme. I think there is a big problem here because we keep being told about the voluntary scheme, and the Government are expecting banks and building societies to be willing volunteers, but they are not. I support this amendment to widen the scheme and bring in National Savings and Investments.</p>

I note that his account book is labelled &#147;The Post Office Account&#148;. I wonder whether that was the same as a National Savings and Investments account. I leave as a question whether we are talking about exactly the same thing. It is certainly the case that there are accounts in National Savings and Investments. We believe that the amount of dormant money potentially available is approaching &#163;1 billion&#151;National Savings and Investments has volunteered that figure. It is a very large amount of money, and it seems odd that there is one rule for banks and building societies and another for the Government. If the Government manage to get a deposit in National Savings and Investments, they can keep it if the customer loses track of the details. That is not the case with the banks, which will not be allowed to do so in future.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000110">I have a couple of questions for the Minister about the consequences if the Government handed over the National Savings and Investments money. If we assume that the whole &#163;1 billion is handed over, it is clear that the Government would have to borrow &#163;1 billion in order to fill the cash hole in the Treasury&#146;s accounts. That swaps one kind of debt for another. Would that increase the government borrowing figures? I am not sure that there would be an increase in the borrowing, but perhaps the Minister would clarify that. Would there be any implications for public expenditure? If there were, where would it flow through? Which department? Which totals would it be in? Would it be in the departmental expenditure limits or the annual managed expenditure limits? How would we see that flowing through the government accounts? I am sure my noble friend will understand that whether I can support his amendment depends on the impact on public expenditure and borrowing.</p>

I think I am right in saying that if there is likely to be a recession, it would be a good thing if they paid up.</p>

I shall address the noble Baroness&#146;s question in a moment. Let us be clear: National Savings and Investments is fundamentally different from private sector banks and building societies. The function of National Savings and Investments is only to borrow money for the Government. All of the money it borrows from the general public is used to fund public spending. This means that money deposited with National Savings and Investments is already being used for the public good, as defined by the priorities established by the democratically elected Government. The liability to pay the National Savings and Investments customer lies with the Exchequer on the National Loans Fund, not with National Savings and Investments out of its own balance sheet.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07121184000113">The answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is quite straightforward: funds deposited with National Savings and Investments are classed as national debt and reduce the amount that the Government need to raise through taxation. Including NS&amp;I in the scheme would mean that we were diverting money that would have been spent on public services to the objectives identified in the scheme. Therefore, the Government would have either to cut planned public spending or to find an alternative way to fund it, having seen these funds being diverted elsewhere. In other words, it would increase the burden on the taxpayer, who would bear the cost either directly through higher taxes or through high-interest costs on the national debt.</p>

National Savings &amp; Investments recognises its obligations in those terms, but resources which are not reunited with the original account holders are a different matter so far as the Government are concerned, whereas the resources from dormant accounts which lie in banks are for the private purposes of the bank.

<p><a name="07121184000123">The amendment puts together two organisations: one is private banks which presently use money that is held in dormant accounts for private purposes or which will in due course use them for the public good under narrowly defined objectives in the legislation; the other is National Savings &amp; Investments, whose dormant resources are devoted to wider dimensions of the public good, as represented by the public debt or the Government&#146;s expenditure.</p>

Of course, that is a loss.</p>

The second objective relates to the part of the dormant accounts which is not claimed. The proposal, if it were included in the second half of the Bill, would be that it would go to charity. That money is in no sense public money; it is owed to the people who deposited it but who happen not to have claimed it.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000129">That is equally true of private sector banks; the same principle applies in each case. I think that my noble friend dealt with the argument that, if that happened, the Government would have to borrow more. In any case, it has to be considered not simply in the context of the borrowing requirement but in the context of macroeconomic management. Given the recent cut in interest rates by the Bank of England, which implies that we need to increase economic activity, the effect of going down that road would be either nothing at all or alternatively an increase in the money supply. Again, the background of the cut in interest rates might seem an appropriate way to go ahead. Therefore, I see no reason why the public sector should not be treated in the same way as the private sector. In the absence of any response, I am sure that we shall return to the matter on Report.

I thought when I came here this afternoon that I was just a simple searcher after truth, but there is a bit more to it now. This clause defines a bank and then says what a bank is not.

<p><a name="07121184000133">Let us look at overseas ownership. The Yorkshire Bank and the Clydesdale Bank are now Australian-owned. The Abbey National, which was demutualised, is now Spanish-owned. Are we clear that those assets are in the Bill? The British Bankers&#146; Association website shows the names of banks. I have led such a sheltered life that I have not come across the bank of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I want to know who is in and who is out. For example, there is a Bank of China. I imagine that if it is in business here with a subsidiary company registered here, it is in. But if it is only a branch and there is nothing registered here, is it in or not? I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000134">On the other side of the fence, the Bank of Ireland and the Allied Irish Bank are clearly Irish, and there is an Irish scheme. What about the resources that are banked here that become dormant in a London branch of one of those banks? Similarly, HBOS is now in business in Ireland. It has only just started there, but do dormant accounts there come under the Irish scheme or this scheme? The clause refers to the United Kingdom; what is the position with Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man? The banks seem to be fond of having branches in these islands, so where do they stand?</p>

<p><a name="07121184000135">It is important to know who is in the scheme, which leads us back to that debate that we had on Amendment No. 27 on transparency. I have been thinking further about that. Transparency is a wonderful thing. If we think of looking through a shop window to see the goods, if half of them are covered up, it is not transparent. Unless we know the banks that are in this scheme, how do we know whether they are participating or not? This is a voluntary scheme, but there is a very tight and specific pool of potential volunteers and I would

The issue is quite straightforward: banks and building societies in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are outside the scheme. If they have branches in the UK, they could participate in the scheme like all other foreign banks that have branches in the UK. As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, indicated, one branch would be enough.</p>

Are the foreign banks that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, referred to, in particular those such as the Bank of China, which has a subsidiary or a branch in the UK&#151;I know not which&#151;part of the BBA scheme? Does the BBA speak for all of the institutions potentially covered by Clause 7&#151;it might make an easier question to take the BBA and the BSA together&#151;or are there a large number of organisations that have not bought in because they are not part of the BBA? There are other banking trade associations&#151;if I can use that term&#151;in London, in particular, those that concentrate on international banks. I am very unclear about whether those banks are within the scheme.

The British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association quite rightly are reaping the rewards because they have taken the initiative. The category of bank is quite clear.

I cannot answer that question&#151;I do not have a full list of the members of the British Bankers&#146; Association to hand&#151;but let me assure the Committee that the British Bankers&#146; Association may be acting as the representative body to carry out these discussions and negotiations about the framework that underpins the Bill, as is the case with the Building Societies Association, but this is not an exclusive exercise. We are concerned with developing a scheme which it is expected and hoped that other banks that have branches in the United Kingdom but which are foreign owned may wish to participate in. How much they will wish to participate may be a matter of how many branches they have in the United Kingdom and how enthusiastic they are about winning the good will which the scheme clearly generates.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000142">The noble Baroness is right that we have negotiated with just one association of banks&#151;the British Bankers&#146; Association&#151;and the Building Societies Association. Those two associations are setting up the scheme. However, it is not an exclusive operation, and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, that no penalties are attached. The legislation enables those institutions which wish to participate to do so. Those which qualify have branches in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000157">These amendments delete subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 9 respectively on a probing basis. Clause 9 defines what is meant by &#147;account&#148; and subsections (1) and (2) appear restrictive. I should have thought that the Government would want as liberal an interpretation as possible of the definition of an account so that as much as possible could be transferred to the reclaim fund, especially in the light of the extremely narrow scope of the Bill, which we have already debated, and the scope of assets being restricted to bank and building society accounts only.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07121184000158">Under subsection (1) the account must at all times have &#147;consisted only of money&#148;. Accounts are always expressed in terms of money. That is true whether they are the accounts of banks or of, say, manufacturers. If I make widgets and buy a widget-making machine for which I pay money, I put that amount in my accounts. It is under a fixed-asset label, but it is still money. I therefore do not understand the practical impact of subsection (1) and should be grateful if the Minister would explain it.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0008.htm_para22">
<p><a name="07121184000159">Subsection (2) restricts accounts to those that are,</p>
<ul><a name="07121184000202">&#147;part of its activity of accepting deposits&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121184000180">Again, I do not understand why the Bill has to be so restrictive. Surely if a bank or building society ends up with its customer&#146;s money on its books, it does not much matter whether it arrived through the door labelled &#147;deposit taking&#148; or one labelled &#147;other financial services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000160">I shall ask the Minister a specific question to illustrate this point. If I have a SIPP&#151;a self-invested personal pension&#151;with a division of one of the banks, that SIPP will have some investments, possibly a great variety of them, but it will also have a bank account through which some of the various transactions flow. That is a statement of fact. My SIPP got that bank account because I set up the SIPP not because I wanted a bank account. Therefore, the

I am trying to clarify whether a bank account associated with a SIPP or any other financial service is intended to be included within the definition of subsection (2).</p>

<a name="71211-gc0008.htm_para24">
<p><a name="07121184000161">It seems to me that a bank&#146;s customers do not have the internal divisions of the banks in their minds when they deal with them. Yet the Bill is predicated on some concept, which I do not quite understand, but which seems to be based on how a bank is organised. I hope that the Minister can explain that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121184000164">There may be merit here, and I know that other amendments have been tabled about other financial deposits that may be dormant and could usefully be put to better purposes than lying idle in banks. I have seen the amendments that have been tabled and recognise the fertility of the minds of noble Lords. We are going to resist those amendments on the simple basis of clarity and simplicity with the launch of a scheme that involves the Government in significant co-operation with the private sector. The company running the scheme will be a private company, which will make it clear that it accepts our initial approach carried, as Members of the Committee will know, in a Labour manifesto way back in 2005. We were talking about current or savings accounts in a straightforward way.</p>

<a name="71211-gc0008.htm_para26">
<p><a name="07121184000165">I hear what the noble Baroness says. Of course there is a range of other assets that perhaps could eventually fit within this framework if they became dormant. However, we are concerned that any assets except ordinary current and deposit accounts raise different issues, including legal issues. Before we extended beyond the simple deposit and current accounts, which is the basis of the agreement with the banks and building societies, we would have to discuss it with the various stakeholders involved. We have not yet carried out that discussion or entertained any prospect of doing so. As I think noble Lords will recognise, this is an ambitious project that takes a great deal of careful thinking and activity to bring it about. We are therefore keeping the concept, as regards accounts, as straightforward and simple as we can. We are talking about current and deposit accounts only.</p>

<a name="07121150000017"><b><a name="71211-wms0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07121150000276">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="07121150000018">My right honourable friend the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support (Baroness Taylor) has now approved, effective from 11 December 2007, the early closure of the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA) regional distribution centres (RDCs) at Longmoor, Shomcliffe, Llangennech, Bulford, Catterick, Chilwell, Colchester and Stirling.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="07121150000019">Under the Future Defence Supply Chain initiative (FDSCi), the MoD assessed a range of options for managing and operating the defence supply chain, to reduce the cost of ownership, while maintaining or improving service levels, and enhancing operational capability. The DSDA's new plan makes greater use of Donnington and Bicester, cutting out the need for a number of RDCs. Much material will be delivered direct rather than through a regional hub and the plan is more sophisticated in selecting how material flows are routed. The DSDA has also opened a warehouse for fast-moving items at Donnington and more than 50 per cent of all DSDA deliveries will be from this new facility. This will provide the opportunity for material to be delivered direct rather than through an RDC and for flexible decisions to be taken as to whether an item is posted, handled by a parcel or pallet carrier, delivered direct, or delivered as part of a multiple delivery route.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="07121150000020">I recognise that this will not be a welcome prospect for those staff who stand to be affected. It is not possible to give an absolute assurance that compulsory redundancies can be avoided, although every effort will be made to do so. The MoD Outplacement Service (MoDOPS) will be available to support staff affected by the closure, offering support with relocation and financial advice. Training will be available to assist staff with the transition to life in the private sector and services of the MoD welfare organisation will also be available to help staff with personal circumstances.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="07121150000021">Consultation with the trade unions has been completed, during which time a counterproposal was received. However, this was not operationally or financially viable. On this basis, I have decided fully to endorse the closures of the RDCs.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_172"><a name="07121150000196">Presenting the third internal market package, the Commission noted that while liberalisation had brought benefits, competitive markets were not yet complete. To meet the spring European Council mandate, real change was necessary to ensure non-discriminatory access, open and transparent markets, incentives to invest, and to improve the powers and independence of regulators. On the key issue of unbundling, the Commission noted that unbundled markets had experienced lower price rises (6 per cent as against 29 per cent) and higher investment. Though the Commission was open to considering alternatives, these had to involve structural separation that ensured the independence of the transmission system operator. The Commission called for swift progress in council.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_190"><a name="07121150000218">On 7 December, representatives of the Contact Group submitted to the UN Secretary-General the report by the EU/Russia/US troika on its work aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement for Kosovo's future status.</p>

During the four months of its mandate, the troika undertook an intense schedule of meetings with the parties. Over 10 rounds of negotiations&#151;including six

One or other of the parties rejected all these options.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para39">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_192"><a name="07121150000220">The troika has therefore reported that the parties have been unable to reach an agreement on Kosovo's status.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para40">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_193"><a name="07121150000221">I pay tribute to the troika's work. It has worked tirelessly and imaginatively. Although it did not secure an agreement between the parties, its work generated sustained and intensive high-level dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. The troika has also been able to extract important commitments from the parties, including pledges to refrain from actions that might jeopardise the security situation in Kosovo or elsewhere and not to use violence, threats or intimidation. These are important commitments to which we shall expect both sides to adhere strictly in the period ahead.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para41">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_194"><a name="07121150000222">The troika's efforts followed those of UN special envoy Ahtisaari who laboured heroically for 14 months to reach agreement between the parties before concluding that this was out of reach. He therefore drew up his own proposal for how to move forward based around the concept of supervised independence. That recommendation was supported by the EU, US and UN Secretary-General. It was rejected by Serbia and Russia.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para42">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_195"><a name="07121150000223">It is hard to argue now that there is any value in further negotiations or that serious options have yet to be fully explored. The failure to reach agreement is not because of lack of time, energy or imagination on the part of the international community. It is because the positions of the parties are irreconcilable. Kosovo insists on independence. Serbia insists on a settlement that locks the door on any prospect of independence. The UK shares the firm view of the EU representative on the troika, ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, that the parties would not be capable of reaching agreement on this issue if negotiations were to be continued, whether in the troika format, or in some other form.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para43">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_196"><a name="07121150000224">The Kosovo status process has now reached a decisive moment, presenting the international community with difficult but important decisions.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para44">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_197"><a name="07121150000225">One point on which almost all in the international community are agreed is that the status quo is unsustainable. This was stated in clear terms by the UN Secretary-General when he addressed the Contact Group ministerial meeting in September in New York. The Contact Group, including Russia, subsequently expressed its agreement in a joint ministerial statement.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0002.htm_para45">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_198"><a name="07121150000226">The international community cannot therefore allow the status process to grind to a halt or to be shuffled off into a siding by convening further fruitless negotiations. We learnt to our cost in the 1990s the heavy human and political price attached to an indecisive international response to looming problems in the western Balkans. The stability and security of part of Europe is at stake. It is essential that we respond in a decisive and far-sighted manner.</p>

However, in the absence of agreement between the parties, we need to be realistic about the slim prospects of securing the necessary level of consensus in the Security Council.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_200"><a name="07121150000228">Against this background it is important that the EU demonstrates its readiness to meet its responsibilities and objectives in respect of stability and security in Europe. Securing a viable and sustainable future for Kosovo is a major responsibility for the EU. The effectiveness and cohesiveness of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy will be judged against our ability to deliver on this responsibility. The EU must demonstrate firm resolve to bring the status process through to completion and play a leading role subsequently in implementing a settlement. I welcome the fact that the EU is already intensively engaged in the necessary preparations to meet these responsibilities.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_201"><a name="07121150000229">In moving towards a Kosovo settlement, it will be necessary for the EU and others to take a strategic approach answering to a series of key challenges. There will be a need to ensure Kosovo's security. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is already deployed in strength in Kosovo to maintain a safe and secure environment. The EU has indicated a readiness to provide a European security and defence policy policing/rule of law mission. The EU should deliver on this commitment.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_202"><a name="07121150000230">There will be a need to ensure good governance in Kosovo. The proposal of the UN special envoy provides a good basis for this. The provisions it set out for the internal governance of Kosovo, and the allocation of responsibilities it contains, must be the foundation for how we deliver security and help Kosovo improve its ability to meet European standards. The EU should be ready to play a major part in settlement implementation including through the appointment of an EU special representative and through contributing to an international civilian office in Kosovo.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_203"><a name="07121150000231">There will be a need to achieve certainty and permanence in respect of Kosovo's future status. Again, the UK believes that the proposal of the UN special envoy for supervised independence provides a good basis.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_204"><a name="07121150000232">There will be a need to look beyond the immediate challenge of resolving Kosovo's future status. Following a settlement, Kosovo will face formidable economic and state-building challenges. The international community&#151;with the EU to the fore&#151;will need to be ready to meet this challenge, including through the swift convening of a donors&#146; conference.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_205"><a name="07121150000233">Finally, there will be a need to address the regional dimension. The UK recognises that moving through this phase will be difficult for Serbia as well as for other countries in the region. The EU must be clear and far-sighted in its commitment to helping them meet European standards and so move further towards eventual accession. There is a compelling strategic case for enlargement to the western Balkans so that this troubled region can share in the security, stability and prosperity that the EU offers. The EU needs to take forward this agenda vigorously in the months ahead.</p>

Many African countries have now signed or initialled interim agreements with the Commission. The Commission underscored the importance of concluding such agreements, particularly for non least developed countries, in order to safeguard trade flows. It agreed to schedule further discussions with the leaders from the five African regions in the new year to take stock of the situation and discuss the way forward. The UK continues to encourage those countries which have yet to sign an interim agreement to do so to avoid damaging trade disruption.

The publication outlines the allocations of the research and science budget for this Comprehensive Spending Review period and provides further details on what this money will deliver. I have placed copies in the House Library.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_223"><a name="07121150000254">The overall research and science budget settlement was announced by the Chancellor in the Comprehensive Spending Review. As a result the department will spend almost &#163;6 billion in total on the research base by 2010-11. This is made up of the research and science budget and nearly &#163;2 billion of funding to reach English universities through the Higher Education Funding Council's (HEFCE) quality-related funding stream (the second leg of the dual support system).</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_224"><a name="07121150000255">The research and science budget specifically will increase from &#163;3.4 billion per year in 2007-08 to almost &#163;4 billion per year by 2010-11, taking the Government's support for the UK's research base to its highest level ever.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_225"><a name="07121150000256">Specifically the allocations will:</p>
fund new commitments to the Office for the Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research (OSCHR);support &#163;120 million of collaborative work between the Technology Strategy Board and the research councils over the CSR period;enable relevant recommendations of the Sainsbury review to be implemented;enable the research councils to fund research at 90 per cent of its full economic cost;increase funding for the Higher Education Innovation Fund; andprovide capital funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the research base and allow UK researchers to benefit from a range of new world-class facilities.

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_227"><a name="07121150000258">The UK continues to perform exceptionally well in research and, increasingly, its exploitation. We remain second only to the US in global scientific excellence (as measured by citations), while collaboration between the research base and business continues to grow ever stronger.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para28">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_228"><a name="07121150000259">The allocations provide significant support for medical research. The Medical Research Council will receive almost &#163;2 billion over the three years to help keep the UK at the forefront of medical advances. Joint investment with the Department of Health, joined up by OSCHR, will ensure that more fundamental research is translated into clinical practice. The funding will also enable the development of the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation (UKCMRI) on the British Library site, and the rebuilding of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge (subject to approval of individual business plans by the Government).</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_229"><a name="07121150000260">In response to the &#147;grand challenges&#148; outlined by the Chancellor at the announcement of the Comprehensive Spending Review, the research councils are embarking on an exciting range of thematic research programmes. These programmes bring together partners from inside and outside the research community in an unprecedented effort to tackle these issues. Programmes

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para30">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_230"><a name="07121150000261">This allocation makes resources available to drive forward the economic impact agenda in the face of global challenges. The research councils have each set out explicit strategies for delivering a step change in their economic impact. The strategies form a solid foundation from which research councils can further raise their emphasis on economic impact during this CSR spending period.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para31">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_231"><a name="07121150000262">In addition, the Higher Education Innovation Fund will rise to &#163;150 million per annum by 2010-11, providing more resources than ever before to support knowledge transfer between universities and business. The Public Sector Research Exploitation Fund will in future attract co-funding from other sources so that even more support can be made available to public sector laboratories as they commercialise their research.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para32">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_232"><a name="07121150000263">We have increased the budget for the successful Science Bridges scheme to &#163;12 million to foster stronger links with international researchers, alongside supporting international fellowships run by the national academies. This will help forge stronger links with the US, China, and India in particular.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para33">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_233"><a name="07121150000264">A new capital investment fund is being created for universities carrying out research council funded projects. This permanent funding stream replaces the temporary Science Research Investment Fund (SRIF) programme, which has helped make good the backlog in investment in research infrastructure. The new fund will help universities to sustain this research infrastructure in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_235"><a name="07121150000266">The Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-14 sets out the Government's commitment to nurturing key disciplines. The research councils, funding councils, and national academies have made significant progress. It is important that all key disciplines remain strong and vibrant. Research priorities will change over time but it is important that the Government are confident that the combined decisions of the research councils properly underpin the health of key disciplines. This is important both for the future of research and, more widely, to ensure a flow of talented individuals into STEM subjects at university.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para36">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_236"><a name="07121150000267">As a next step, I have asked Ian Diamond, as chair of RCUK, to organise a series of reviews on the health of key research disciplines in the UK. The first of these reviews will be on physics and will span at least three research councils (the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Science and Technology Facilities Council). It will be led by Professor Bill Wakeham, Vice-Chancellor, University of Southampton.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para38">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_238"><a name="07121150000269">Investment in advanced experimental facilities is of critical importance to the long-term success of the research base. STFC invests significantly in national facilities (such as Diamond and Isis) and international subscriptions (for example, the European research centre at CERN). The allocation to STFC supports the Government's vision for Harwell and Daresbury to be developed as science and innovation campuses.</p>

The research base also delivers improvements in public service delivery and contributes to improvements in education, health and culture.</p>

<a name="71211-wms0003.htm_para43">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_243"><a name="07121150000274">The allocation of the science budget will continue to support the full spectrum of academic endeavour. It will ensure that all benefits from the excellent research base are maximised by encouraging the full exploitation of fundamental research. It will support the long-term sustainability of research in the UK, while encouraging further international collaboration.</p>

In the context of urban drainage, it is important that the design of the urban fabric allows safe routes for the outflow of excess surface water. Planning guidance encourages this though it can be difficult to achieve in established developed areas.</p>

This involves testing &#147;dry blood spots&#148;' collected in a way that does not need specialist equipment at the point of care. This technology offers a vital opportunity for timely access to lifesaving treatment and care services for children who are infected with HIV.
