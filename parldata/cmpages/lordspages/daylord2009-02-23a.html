Can he confirm that, as the result of a decision by the European Court of Human Rights, the Government are now working out how to give the right to vote to prisoners in our jails? If that is the case, would it not be invidious if prisoners were to have the vote&#151;I welcome the fact that they are to have it&#151;but we were debarred from voting until some time in the distant future?</p>

Parliament consists of three estates: the Sovereign, the Lords and the Commons. The Lords sit in their own right while Members of the Commons are elected by the remainder of the estate of commoners to represent them in Parliament. There was therefore no case for the Lords to vote to elect representatives since they were able to sit in Parliament anyway. Further, even if they had voted, they did not belong to the estate from which the Commons was elected and which it represented. I should add that the great American president, Thomas Jefferson, had another view on why the Commons passed this declaration in 1699, but I shall not trouble the House with it today.</p>

Although Jefferson announced his views a long time ago, Senators in the United States can vote for Congressmen today and have been able to do so for some time. Surely we can take a leaf out of that book.</p>

There may be an exception to be had given recent allegations concerning disciplinary matters but, on the whole, our view remains the same. Comprehensive reform of this House, including the subject of the Question today, would, without support from all parties, risk throwing away what the parties have done so far to reach agreement. We intend to put a comprehensive package of reform to the electorate as a manifesto commitment at the next election. I think and hope that the House is with us in believing that it is much better to do this than to rush through full-scale reform without agreement or time to develop well considered proposals.</p>

Is not the question of whether this House is to be appointed or elected irrelevant? If there is no good reason why Members of this House should not be able to vote, and if, as my noble friend suggested, there is to be early legislation on certain reforms of the House, will he ensure that this matter is dealt with in that legislation?</p>

Dr Tim Stone was commissioned to carry out a review, as a result of which a short-term pay deal is under negotiation with the trade unions. That will introduce a range of factors that we hope will address some of the short-term recruitment and retention problems. A satellite office is being established in London and one is to be established in Cheltenham, which are both strategic locations for recruitment. A restructuring of the nuclear inspectorate is proposed to deal with the very issues that the noble Lord has rightly raised.</p>

Indeed, while the Nuclear Industry Association, which I chair, is in no way sanguine, it recognises that a lot is being done. However, it has to be said that, as with the reform of the NII, we get dribs and drabs of information when the House requires a comprehensive statement of where we are. That would be helpful and would probably be more useful than the kind of question and answer session that we are having. Will the Minister take that on board?</p>

As far as the nuclear regulator is concerned, one should also pay tribute to the tremendous work and skills of the people employed by the Nuclear Directorate.

This is all taking too long. Tim Stone&#146;s report came in, but it has taken the Government six months to answer it. Now the Minister tells us that they are going to take on a large study. I cannot understand why they are taking so long when this country is in such a desperate state due to the lack of its own energy.</p>

Frankly, it is unfair to say that the Government have not responded. We commissioned the review. We are looking at it seriously. We are negotiating with the trade unions. We have established a satellite office in London because that is an important recruitment centre. We are taking a number of other actions. We are not complacent but, equally, the nuclear industry is at an important stage; hence, we are asking the sector skills council to produce the review, which will be published in the summer.</p>

If the Government had done nothing in the face of this developing crisis in Sri Lanka I have no doubt that the noble Lord, who is always knowledgeable about these issues, would have been very critical. The Government sought after consultation to appoint Des Browne, with his experience of military and defence issues, as a special envoy. As the noble Lord will recognise, this is all about a military conquest of the northern part of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankans then said that they were not prepared to accept him as an envoy, and we are still discussing the issue with them.

If it were withdrawn the Sri Lankan economy, which is already blighted by the present world problems, would be likely to lose 140,000 jobs and see its gross national product drop by 2 per cent. That is very serious. So we should be careful about the economic aspects of the position. However, the Government intend to bring pressure to bear in every way they can on the Sri Lankan Government to observe human rights.

Press freedom in Sri Lanka, to which the Sri Lankan Government contend they are committed, is of the greatest importance in ensuring that the world fully understands the position as it develops in these difficult times. The House will recall that the editor presaged his murder in an article that he wrote before his death and which was widely circulated, including in sections of the British press. He identified the threat to anyone who voiced criticism of the regime, even someone such as himself who had been quite friendly with the President of Sri Lanka. That shows how parlous the situation is. I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing attention to it.</p>

The Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and India have sought to demonstrate that we are prepared to carry out evacuation by sea if that proves possible, but it has not proven successful thus far. The narrow corridor down which displaced civilians are expected to escape the conflict is itself so fraught with problems that it is not proving an effective escape route for very many. That is why the situation is so desperate for civilians in the northern part of Sri Lanka.</p>

If so, are there some special contributions that we can make from our experience in other parts of the world, notably Northern Ireland, to ensure that this living together really begins to take place and that Sri Lanka does not go straight back to another horrific and brutal civil war of the kind that we have seen over the past 20 years?</p>

I am one of many Ministers over the years who owes Ron Dearing an enormous debt of gratitude for his wise advice and counsel, which was always generously given.

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0902234000065"></a>The body which is likely to be created to deal with Scottish waters for the purposes of the Scottish marine Bill is Marine Scotland. Indeed, a press release from the Scottish Government on 9 February indicated that a new marine management body was being created to help Scotland make the most of its seas for future generations and stated that Marine Scotland would be up and running by 1 April this year. It went on to indicate that it would play a key role in managing Scotland&#146;s seas with direct responsibility for marine science, planning, policy development, management and compliance monitoring measures. It also indicates that it will work with other partners with marine interests to deliver both economic prosperity and environmental sustainability.</p>

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0902234000066"></a>It is fair to say that it is a body which enjoys cross-party support. Indeed, I seem to recall that in Committee on the first part of the Bill&#151;on the MMO&#151;there was an indication that Marine Scotland would play a role comparable to the MMO so far as Scottish inshore and offshore waters were concerned.</p>

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0902234000067"></a>I wish to raise some simple questions. Does the Scottish Parliament have the legislative competence to endow Marine Scotland with a remit in respect of the offshore area? Clearly, Marine Scotland will be able to be established by the act of the Scottish Executive, but one presumes that it will have a role and responsibility that relates to the offshore area, where there will be devolved responsibility to Scottish Ministers. Will the Scottish Parliament have any role in establishing what Marine Scotland can or cannot do? If the answer is that it will, I would like to know the basis for such legislative competence. If not, should the Bill not confer powers on the Scottish Parliament?</p>

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0902234000068"></a>The amendment specifically relates to a duty on biodiversity. Its wording is very similar to that in Section 1 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. Section 2(1) of that Act refers to the Scottish biodiversity strategy. The duty&#151;it is for,</p>
<ul><a name="0902234000256"></a>&#147;every public body and office-holder, in exercising any functions, to further the conservation of biodiversity so far as is consistent with the proper exercise of those functions&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0902234000202"></a>has been widely supported in Scotland. However, it can apply only up to the 12-mile limit. The marine conservation group of the Advisory Group on Marine and Coastal Strategy, which was set up in 2005 by my colleague Ross Finnie MSP, the then Minister for Environment and Rural Development, commended the above statutory definition of a biodiversity duty but acknowledged that to extend it beyond the 12-mile limit would require legislation at Westminster.</p>

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0902234000069"></a>Subsequently, the Scottish Government&#146;s own consultation on the Scottish marine Bill&#151;<I>Sustainable Seas for All</I>, published last summer&#151;states, at paragraph 117:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0902234000224"></a>&#147;The Biodiversity Duty in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 could also be considered as a wider measure in that it is not limited in its application to protected sites or specific species protection. Some potential improvements to this duty are described below&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902234000204"></a>nautical miles. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0902234000226"></a>&#147;If Scottish Ministers achieve further devolution of nature conservation in the offshore area beyond 12nm, the Scottish Ministers would propose extending the scope of the duty to apply to all public bodies exercising functions in the offshore area. If further devolution cannot be agreed we would discuss with the UK Government how best to take forward this proposal&#148;.</p>

<a name="90223-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0902234000070"></a>While I raise a general point about the competence of the Scottish Parliament in respect of Marine Scotland in the offshore area, the specific point is that it does not seem possible or competent for the Scottish Parliament to impose a biodiversity duty on public bodies in the offshore area, as the law stands. I see nothing in the Bill that would allow the Scottish Parliament to do so. There is soon to be recognition that, if it could not be done by the Scottish Parliament, it should be done by Westminster, and the amendment would undoubtedly facilitate that. That is the background to why I move the amendment.</p>

While at first sight the strict wording does not exactly fit the spirit of co-operation with which the Government insist that the marine policy statement be approached, it serves as a useful amendment to probe the Government on what elements the marine policy statement will contain and whether biodiversity will be one of them. The Scottish Administration, in their consultation paper to which the noble Lord referred, <I>Sustainable Seas for All</I>, are a little more forthcoming than the Minister has found himself able to be with the Committee. They say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0902234000227"></a>&#147;The United Kingdom Government and Devolved Administrations have worked together to set out a number of high level marine objectives which articulate the outcomes they are seeking&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902234000205"></a>The objectives are set out in sections that reflect the five principles of sustainable development. It would be immensely helpful to the Committee if the Minister would make these available in their current form, even if they are not fully developed. If he cannot do so, the Committee would be helped by some explanation.</p>

I am sure that Scotland has all the powers that it needs over the Scottish inshore region. Can the Minister explain to the Committee whether the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 contains all the powers that the Government consider necessary for the protection of biodiversity, and whether that is the mechanism that they expect Scottish Ministers to use? If not, what legislation would be required to ensure that the powers of the Act would extend to the offshore region administered by Scottish Ministers? This does not appear to be contained in any legislation emanating

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0902234000074"></a>Biodiversity has been a hot topic, in particular in relation to Cardigan Bay, where netsmen on trawlers with heavy-duty equipment are ruining the seabed by dredging it for various shellfish. This is happening beyond the 12-mile limit of the inshore area contained in the Bill for Wales. To secure proper biodiversity in areas such as Cardigan Bay, we need the powers to police beyond the 12-mile limit. If the Minister accepts this amendment, which I hope he does, will he consider a similar amendment for Wales? I believe, from my knowledge of the Government of Wales Acts 1998 and 2006, that the Welsh Assembly does not have this power.</p>

I will start with the proposal from the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, for a new clause specifically on a marine plan for the Scottish offshore region. This would enable Scottish Ministers to place a duty on every public body and officeholder to further the conservation of biodiversity. The intent of the amendment is to incorporate this duty in a marine plan for the Scottish offshore region, under legislation to be passed following scrutiny by the Scottish Parliament. The amendment would also pass competence for this legislation to the Scottish Parliament. The terms &#147;public body&#148;, &#147;office-holder&#148; and,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0902234000077"></a>The first issue here is further devolution to the Scottish Parliament, which is a significant matter of principle. Noble Lords will know&#151;this is also a response to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey&#151;that the Bill has been drafted within the current devolution settlement. The Government and the devolved Administrations have agreed that new powers in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill will be the subject not of legislative devolution but of a form of executive devolution, under which the Scottish Government will operate the legislation.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_15"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90223-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0902234000078"></a>What is the relationship between executive devolution and the Scottish Parliament? As I understand it, the Scottish Parliament will be able to hold Scottish Ministers to account. Under the Bill&#146;s planning and nature conservation provisions, there will also be a role for this Parliament&#151;I suggest that there is a similarity here&#151;in that it will be able to hold UK Ministers to account for the way in which they exercise their right to agree or disagree with Scottish Ministers&#146; proposals. Essentially, that recognises the reality of the current complex mix of reserved and devolved matters in the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0902234000079"></a>We have all agreed that a new system of marine planning is needed to enable us to manage our seas better. For it to deliver the benefits that we all want, the marine policy statement and the plans underneath it need to impact across the breadth of interest in our seas. We must secure issues of national importance, such as defence, shipping, oil and gas. That is why the Government have to agree to marine plans drawn up by Scottish Ministers, which is a very important part of ensuring that such matters are protected.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0902234000080"></a>Scottish Ministers may exercise in any manner they deem appropriate the functions that they already have. That must include establishing Marine Scotland. Once the Bill has been enacted, Scottish Ministers will also have marine planning and the Bill&#146;s nature conservation functions in the offshore area, with the UK Government retaining functions on defence, oil, gas and shipping. Scottish Ministers do not have the competence to give those functions to Marine Scotland. As I understand it, Marine Scotland will, legally speaking, be a part of the Scottish Executive. Therefore, Scottish Ministers do not need any powers to set it up as they wish or to give it the functions that they wish it to exercise. Legally speaking, the actions of Marine Scotland will be those of the Scottish Ministers and, from my understanding of the Scottish Parliament, I believe that Scottish Ministers will of course be held accountable by the Scottish Parliament for the exercise of those powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0902234000085"></a>On biodiversity, the simple and straightforward answer is that, although we do not use the wording used by the noble Lord, we believe that we have covered the matter in the Bill. In Clause 121, there is a duty on public bodies, including those in the Scottish offshore area, to further the conservation objectives of designated sites. Moreover, public authorities must  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have regard to advice from the statutory conservation body, which, for the offshore region, is the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0902234000086"></a>Further than that, sustainable development and the vital place that conservation occupies in our suite of marine policies are captured in the marine policy statement under Clause 42 and in marine plans under Clause 49. Those documents will clearly set out how our policies will contribute to achieving sustainable development and how we intend to treat fragile, rare and representative parts of our marine environment and to further the conservation of biodiversity. They will also steer the marine licensing process that is subject to Part 4 of the Bill&#151;we might get to it one day&#151;under which decisions must be made in accordance with the marine policy statement and with marine plans. Through that mechanism, the Bill will ensure that all decision-makers in the marine environment have to consider biodiversity in making their decisions.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0902234000087"></a>I hope that I have, in general, reassured the noble Lord that it is quite within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to hold Scottish Ministers to account for their actions under executive devolution.</p>

<a name="0902234000088"></a><b><a name="90223-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0902234000361"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply, as indeed I thank the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and my noble friend Lord Livsey for their contributions. I note that the Minister used the word &#147;complex&#148; about some of these arrangements; his reply underlined that. My concern, which the Minister has addressed to a considerable extent&#151;although, given the complexity, it is something that we would want to go away and consider&#151;is that, for the offshore region, the Scottish Parliament has no say in determining what the powers might be in relation to Scottish Ministers, albeit that it can call them to account.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0902234000089"></a>Some of the paperwork that the Minister&#146;s department has sent us, to which he referred, is genuinely helpful and some of the maps are particularly useful. The one on who will issue marine licences, which I happen to be looking at, has a map relating to construction work. The areas in which Scottish Ministers will issue a marine licence are striped and the areas where Scottish Ministers will issue a FEPA licence&#151;the inshore waters&#151;is blue. The document says that the Scottish Executive intend to replace the FEPA regime with a new licensing system under the Scottish Marine Bill. It seems to me that we could, almost certainly, end up with two separate regimes: one to be determined for inshore waters, under the Scottish Marine Bill, and one to be determined elsewhere, under FEPA, one assumes, or under what this Bill puts in place.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0902234000090"></a>If one object is to try to get some consistency between inshore and offshore, it does not necessarily follow that you will get that, even with the best will in the world, if two separate Parliaments are legislating for it. I use that as an example because, while it is now clear that Marine Scotland can be an arm of the Scottish Government and therefore will not necessarily require separate legislation to be established, its functions will be determined in some respects by this Parliament and in others by the Scottish Parliament. I am not sure that that is necessarily the best way to progress. Regarding

I note his reference to Clause 121, which extends only to marine conservation zones, although he also referred to Clauses 42 and 49, which might have a more general application in the offshore area.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0902234000091"></a>I know that there has been cross-party support to extend the biodiversity duty and a recognition in Scotland that that is not possible under the present powers of the Scottish Parliament.

I will want to go away and consider what the Minister has said on whether the bits that are in place in this legislation fully address this issue.

This includes terrestrial bodies and other marine plan authorities. This is so that each of these planning bodies has as much notice as possible about what is happening and can prepare for their involvement in other plans or perhaps decide to plan at the same time. This will be most beneficial in areas that are particularly difficult to manage, such as cross-border estuaries.

They substitute the term &#147;adjoins or is adjacent to&#148; because it is easier to identify at the start of the planning process what the adjoining or adjacent areas are. It may only be later, when planning starts in earnest, that it is clear that other planning authorities should be consulted. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 covers the situation if it becomes clear that another marine plan authority or local or regional planning body also has an interest, although it is not adjoining or adjacent. Under that paragraph, the marine plan authority must take all reasonable steps to ensure compatibility between its plans and the marine plans. There is an extensive consultation process when producing plans, as set out in paragraphs 3 to 7 of this schedule. The statement of public participation for each plan will ensure that should terrestrial or marine planning authorities, in addition to those whose areas adjoin or are adjacent to the marine plan area, have an interest, they will be consulted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0902234000095"></a>Amendment 89BZD is a consequential amendment in that the provision related to Northern Ireland in paragraph 1(2)(d) will no longer be required since the Northern Ireland inshore region adjoins the Northern Ireland offshore region and the Scottish inshore region only. As marine plan authority for the Northern Ireland offshore region, the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland would be notified in any event. Since the Bill does not provide for marine planning in the Scottish inshore region, there is no marine plan authority for the Scottish inshore region under the Bill. Amendment 89BD is a further consequential amendment following from Amendments 89BZB and 89BZC because if the term &#147;related to&#148; is no longer used in this paragraph, there is no need for the definition in paragraph 1(3), and the sub-paragraph can be deleted. However, the term &#147;related to&#148; is used again in paragraph 3, so Amendment 89BK inserts the definition in that paragraph instead.</p>

I would have said that &#147;adjoins&#148; means alongside without a gap and that &#147;adjacent&#148; means very near, but I am not sure how far away you can be and still be adjacent. I suggest &#147;contiguous&#148; as an alternative, but only because I was searching for another word in the same category.

We are entering an interesting part of the structure of what the Government are creating. They seem to expect all adjoining or adjacent areas to have some say in what is happening in the next area. This process will obviously have to be handled with some tact. By way of an example, if, as someone suggested, Scotland decided to have only one or two offshore regions, every plan contained in the whole Scottish offshore region would have an input from the Secretary of State, and probably will anyway. It might be worth the Minister putting on the record which Secretary of State that would be.

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0902234000102"></a>On our previous day in Committee, we spent some time in a similar discussion defining the interests and powers in the Severn estuary, and it would be interesting to see whether the Minister wishes to vary his response. In this case, the options are rather more limited, as Scottish Ministers&#146; authority would be required for anything that affected their interests. Will the Minister elucidate for the Committee whether there is any place in the Bill in which we can require the Scottish Administration in their control of the relevant parts of the Scottish inshore area to consult another UK area that adjoins it or to which it is adjacent?</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0902234000103"></a>On the same subject, will the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, explain why he is so prescriptive about local authorities that have to be consulted? Does he have a strong rationale about the role of local authorities? Perhaps he has more up-to-date information than I do, but my impression is that the Scottish Administration do not yet have a settled view of which model they will use for designating Scottish marine regions in the Scottish inshore area. At least four possible administrative groupings appear to affect the Scottish coastal area,

This is the nub of the issue when trying to define the border area between Scottish government control and Westminster. I hope that the Minister will be able to expand a little.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0902234000105"></a>The origin of my amendments is that paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 requires the marine plan authority that is preparing a marine plan for a marine plan area to give notice of its intention to do so to related planning authorities. Paragraph 1(2) of the schedule defines the related planning authorities, and paragraph 1(4) subsequently defines a local planning authority as one,</p>
<ul><a name="0902234000260"></a>&#147;to be read in accordance with section 37 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902234000209"></a>It struck me that any developments in the English inshore area in the Solway Firth could have implications for Dumfries and Galloway and the area that is inshore but immediately adjoining the estuary of the Tweed could have implications for the Scottish Borders Council.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0902234000106"></a>Amendment 89BG amends the definition of &#147;local planning authority&#148; to include Scottish local planning authorities. I may be wrong, but I believe that it meets the purpose of my amendments probably more felicitously than mine. There is nothing terribly magical about it; it simply recognises proximity, and I am grateful to the Minister for tabling it.</p>

<a name="0902234000107"></a><b><a name="90223-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0902234000367"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I am very grateful to noble Lords for their amendments. I am sorry to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is unwell. We would much prefer him to be present. We know that even when he is not present, his ingenuity in bringing forward amendments means that he will raise issues that we have already discussed and that we will have to have another go. We always welcome his interventions.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0902234000108"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, rightly seeks to probe these areas. My understanding is that the term,</p>
<ul><a name="0902234000261"></a>&#147;whose area adjoins or is adjacent to&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0902234000210"></a>includes any area that partly adjoins or is adjacent to the marine plan area. The planning provisions in the Bill are written to ensure widespread consultation and liaison. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 continues this theme with a duty to notify a related planning authority, so it would be out of keeping if planning authorities were not notified because their areas were only partially related to the marine plan area.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0902234000109"></a>Amendments 89BZF, 89BC and 89BF come to the nub of the point that the noble Baroness made about the requirement to notify other planning authorities from the ones that adjoin or are adjacent to the marine plan area. She wants to change this to those that are &#147;contiguous with&#148; the marine plan area. My understanding is that an area that is contiguous is in contact with the marine plan area. We think that that is covered by the term &#147;adjoining&#148;. My understanding is the word &#147;adjacent&#148; includes areas that may not exactly touch the marine plan area but are close to it.  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_21"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is a wider definition, which would include notifying more related planning authorities. But there must be circumstances where it is right so to do. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness on that wording.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0902234000110"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is right with his Amendment 89BA. He spotted defective drafting in this area because, as drafted, the Bill does not make the same provisions for notification of Scottish terrestrial planning bodies. More importantly, paragraph 3 of Schedule 6, which requires marine plan authorities to,</p>
<ul><a name="0902234000262"></a>&#147;take all reasonable steps to secure&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0902234000211"></a>compatibility of their plans with these terrestrial development plans, also lacks a reference to Scottish development plans.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0902234000111"></a>We agree that this needs to be rectified, which we have done by reference to the relevant terrestrial planning legislation, as we have done in relation to English and Welsh plans. This will ensure that the notification and compatibility duties automatically adjust to any future changes to the Scottish terrestrial planning system or to local planning authority names or boundaries.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0902234000112"></a>On a more general issue, the noble Duke asked whether the Government&#146;s thinking has moved on since we debated the Severn and the relationship between England and Wales. The blunt answer is that our thinking has not moved on, although I acknowledge that we had an interesting debate when we exposed some of the challenges of ensuring that, in what we have all already agreed is a complex situation, ultimately we get an integrated approach. I am sure that is the aim of all Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="90223-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0902234000113"></a>However, the issue is that we have to do this within the context of the devolution settlement. For instance, in our debate two weeks ago, we had an amendment designed to enable joint planning and a joint plan to be produced between two Administrations. Because of the different legal systems, particularly in relation to Scotland and the devolution arrangements, it is very difficult to have such a joint system. But of course we would very much encourage neighbouring plan authorities to co-ordinate planning timetables and make arrangements for collaborative working. Obviously, that would clearly help users of the sea, lovers of the sea and all those with an interest.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0902234000114"></a>Ultimately, we are dependent on the Administrations making this work together. We think that there are enough incentives to enable that to happen. I would go back to the discussions in the summer and autumn of last year. Because of the intent expressed by all the Administrations, I am optimistic that they can see it is in everyone&#146;s best interest that we work together. But we have to work within the devolution settlement, which makes it difficult to accede to the intent behind the amendment that we discussed two weeks ago about having a joint plan between the two Administrations.</p>

Following the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Government have improved the paragraph regarding independent investigation, but it is still discretionary and not mandatory, as is the case for the equivalent public examination of terrestrial planning. I understand that there is a concern that to have a mandatory arrangement would be too heavy and bureaucratic, but experience suggests that EIPs need not, and often do not, take long. My own experience of the EIP process on the London Plan was that it was a useful process. It took seven weeks, but given the size and complexity of London, that is not so very much time. Most importantly, it enabled all those with an interest&#151;interest groups, statutory bodies and landholders&#151;to become involved in an inclusive and participative but not overly bureaucratic process. Moreover, it was able to test the soundness of the plan&#146;s evidence base and policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0902234000128"></a>I shall deal first with Amendments 89J and 89JZA to paragraph 13 of Schedule 6. As currently drafted, this paragraph requires a marine plan authority to consider, after the public consultation and before adopting a plan, whether there is a need to appoint an independent investigator to investigate the proposed plan and report on it. In deciding whether to appoint an investigator, the marine plan authority must have regard to the various representations that people have made throughout the preparation of the plan and the public consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, invites me to be very specific about when such a power should be used. However, I am going to resist that and say to him that the guiding principle is that it is intended to be used to resolve any issues that remain outstanding after the public consultation. Our aim is to ensure that the plans prepared have the support of the local community as well as the various industries, interest groups and regulators who, in one way or another, will be using the plan or subject to it. It is clearly in everyone&#146;s interest to ensure that issues are resolved and consensus reached wherever possible. It will inevitably not be possible to please all of the interests all of the time and that is where an independent viewpoint might be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0902234000129"></a>We have learned from the examination in public process recently carried out in relation to regional spatial strategies under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. But there is a distinction, to which the noble Baroness fairly referred in her opening remarks, in that the marine environment is not the same as the land. A slightly different approach is justified, building on the best aspects of examination in public while recognising the different interests and issues that arise at sea. We have therefore put in place a mechanism to allow independent scrutiny, but we do not think that it is appropriate to make it mandatory for every plan.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0902234000130"></a>The reason we do not believe it should be mandatory comes down to a point which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised in his interesting comments about avoiding bureaucratic processes, a point which I well understand. In the debate on the planning Act, which I joined at a late stage, one could see that part of the legislation&#146;s purpose was to address the frustrations felt by many with the past planning system. The point is that having an automatic inquiry would mean that there would be less incentive to reach a common position throughout the development of the plan. Two key themes have emerged from our debates on the Bill so far. First, lots of different interests are concerned about the marine environment. Secondly, to make it work we need people to work together. We therefore want to provide incentives throughout the Bill to encourage people to work together. We want people to engage actively in the planning process and to consider and resolve issues not only with the planning authority but with each other throughout in reaching a common agreement.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0902234000131"></a>The interests likely to be affected at sea are rather different from those found on land. There are fewer personal and private property rights and more potential conflicts of principle about how best to manage, conserve or exploit our marine resources. We believe that the lower number of private property rights will reduce  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_26"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the need for an automatic independent inquiry. People will also have the opportunity via participation in the preparation of the marine policy statement to shape the Government's direction on these matters of principle, which will then be fed down into the marine plans.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0902234000132"></a>We have also discussed why it may not be appropriate to plan in depth for all areas of the sea. Some areas are far less busy than others. It would not seem the best use of public resources to require an independent scrutiny if in practice there was no need for one. This approach also allows flexibility, so that the independent scrutiny process is proportionate to the issues raised. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised a point on regulation. I say to him that we want a proportionate approach to how we do it.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0902234000133"></a>Of course people feel very strongly about the sea and the coast, particularly those for whom the sea provides their livelihood. We want to hear what they have to say. A plan which does not have the support of the local community, industry and interest groups is likely to be challenged, and this will make it harder for decision-makers and investors to rely on it. The short answer to the major questions raised is that we would commission an independent investigation wherever there are substantial unresolved issues, and where it can add value. If that were the case with every plan, the Bill would enable us to appoint an independent person.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0902234000134"></a>Amendment 89JZC seeks to amend paragraph 15(2) of Schedule 6. This amendment could place the Secretary of State in a rather difficult position. I should like to explain a little more about why we have required the Secretary of State&#146;s agreement to the adoption of devolved marine plans, although I realise that we shall debate this in relation to later amendments.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0902234000135"></a>The purpose of requiring the Secretary of State to agree to the adoption of devolved marine plans is to ensure that non-devolved policies and functions are appropriately represented and protected in those plans. This final agreement should be a formality since we expect and indeed have every confidence that the devolved plan authorities will work closely with the Secretary of State and the UK Government throughout the planning process to ensure that we are content with their proposals. Following the agreement last autumn under the auspices of the joint ministerial committee, there are also a number of other fixed points during the planning process at which the Secretary of State must give his agreement, including before the publication of the statement of public participation and before the publication of the draft plan for public consultation, to minimise the chance of the Secretary of State being forced to veto a devolved plan because of its potential effect on &#147;retained&#148; functions. We have also agreed between Administrations our wish to work constructively together and to produce an agreed MPS and plans.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0902234000136"></a>The purpose of the Secretary of State&#146;s agreement is not to reopen the plan to further representations once the marine plan authority is ready to adopt it. As I said, Amendment 89JZC could oblige the Secretary of State to consider the representations made by another person in addition to those made by the independent inspector&#151;perhaps representations made by someone who  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_27"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>did not agree with the inspector&#146;s recommendations&#151;leaving the Secretary of State to choose between the views of that person or the independent investigator even if the inspector&#146;s report recommended that the draft plan was satisfactory. We do not think that that amendment would make the process of developing and adopting a marine plan any more transparent or inclusive. Where an independent investigator has endorsed a plan, or where his recommendations have been addressed by the plan authority, we would expect the Secretary of State to give his agreement to that plan, as long as he was content with its effect on matters which are not devolved to the plan authority.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0902234000137"></a>Paragraphs 12 and 14 of Schedule 6 require the plan authority to give careful consideration to any representations made about the plan during its preparation and the public consultation as well as those made by an independent investigation, where this has taken place. If it chooses not to implement those recommendations, it is also required by paragraph 15 to give its reasons for that decision. We should not ask the Secretary of State to second-guess the investigator.</p>

<a name="90223-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0902234000138"></a>I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that there are positive reasons for there not being an automatic investigation and that the whole effort is to try to reach consensus. However, where it is not possible to reach consensus on serious matters, it is entirely appropriate for an investigation to be triggered at that stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0902234000143"></a>With regard to my two amendments I am a little puzzled. The Minister started by explaining that there were likely to be fewer outstanding issues when dealing with marine plans, but one of the difficulties is knowing whether there are outstanding issues. I take the point that allowing people to be involved in something that is equivalent to an examination in public helps to reconcile those who may not be satisfied with the substance or at any rate the process, because they feel that they have been given a fair hearing. One sees that from planning development control applications upwards. There is value in thrashing out matters of principle as well as private property rights in this sort of forum. He talked, too, about there being less incentive to reach consensus if there is an independent investigation. I confess that I do not follow that. The only incentive would be on the Government. I cannot see that there would be an incentive on others.</p>

The intention is that the process will allow for widespread engagement of those with an interest as the plan is developed. The marine plan authority has to have regard to various representations made throughout the preparation of the plan and the public consultation. That is all there to be done. For that reason I should have thought it a perfectly sensible proposition that the aim all along is to reach a strong consensus.</p>

As I said, the construct of the Bill is an attempt to encourage consensus. If it turned out, alas, in the preparation of each plan, however many are developed, that consensus had failed to be reached on strong, substantial issues in each of them, the Bill allows for an independent examination to take place.</p>

I see no reason why that could not also apply in the case of a marine plan. I have spent long enough on this.

I did not move my other amendments that deal with the role of the Secretary of State. I realised when I re-read them in preparation for today that I have been rather too affected&#151;or possibly infected&#151;by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, with which I am involved at the moment and where there is considerable temptation to react against the intervention of the Secretary of State. That is not quite the same here. However, I have retained Amendment 89JZB because, as I read it, the Secretary of State would have a veto over all other marine plan authorities in the adoption of a marine plan. I may have misunderstood some link in the process, which means that it is logical for the Secretary of State to have this veto. However, if it is not a matter of logic but of giving the Secretary of State a power that he would not otherwise have had during the process, I am concerned about the paragraph. I beg to move.</p>

He might not be able to veto the whole Bill. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I am afraid that, speaking from this Dispatch Box, I cannot agree with the noble Baroness that the Secretary of State does not need to give agreement to plans relating to retained functions. As we have spent some time discussing already, this Bill potentially devolves enormous powers. These are mainly executive powers, although there is still the question of whether some legislative power might be needed.

However, removing the ability of the Secretary of State to check on decisions affecting retained functions does not seem to be the best way to ensure this. Can the Minister explain to the Committee how a marine plan authority could have any reason for making provisions relating to retained functions? Presumably this would not be to the extent of exercising retained functions. That is surely beyond the powers that even a Secretary of State enjoys under the current legislation. There are clauses in the Bill that perhaps require consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0902234000152"></a>The trouble with the amendment is that it strikes at the heart of the settlement that we have reached with the devolved Administrations for marine planning. We have made available a briefing note and a dedicated session on devolution in relation to this Bill. Noble Lords have been seeking reassurance that new functions have not been legislatively devolved under this Bill; I assure the Committee that they have not. Rather, we have between us agreed a form of executive devolution. This recognises that, while the real benefits of marine planning are achieved only if authorities plan for all activities in the marine environment, it is important that such plans are agreed between Administrations so that we can feel comfortable that important matters, such as UK interests in oil and gas, shipping and defence, are protected.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0902234000153"></a>Under the Bill, the devolved Administrations become the planning authority for the relevant offshore region. They may prepare plans which affect both devolved and non-devolved matters. We believe that it would be almost impossible to plan in respect of devolved matters, predominantly fisheries, some nature conservation functions, renewable energy, and so on, without in some way also affecting retained matters, such as oil and gas exploration and exploitation, defence and shipping. It is because of the complex mix of devolved and reserved or non-devolved matters in the offshore areas that all plans for the offshore areas must be agreed by the Secretary of State before adoption by the marine plan authority, which is exactly the point made so effectively by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0902234000154"></a>Similarly, this must also apply to a Welsh plan for the Welsh inshore region if it covers retained functions. This is to ensure appropriate protection for reserved or non-devolved functions, defined in the Bill as retained functions, in the offshore area. This requirement for the Secretary of State to agree all offshore plans and any Welsh inshore plans that relate to non-devolved matters is an important condition of the devolution package for this Bill, which was agreed by the Joint Ministerial Committee across all four Administrations last summer and autumn. It is an approach supported by the devolved Administrations as a way of agreeing to work together for the good of all of us across the UK seas.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0902234000155"></a>I accept that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, approached this position with some element of scepticism; she wanted to be absolutely sure that we are not proceeding with the Bill except on the basis of an agreed position with the devolved Administrations. I assure her on that point, and I therefore hope that she will feel some confidence in withdrawing the amendment.</p>

If the United Kingdom Administration wished to see some of these elements developed, we are saying that at the moment the devolved Administrations could put a stop to these things through refusing planning. Perhaps the fact that it is checked by the Secretary of State might overcome that, but it is

This will avoid any misunderstandings or last-minute disagreements that could jeopardise the adoption of the plan and lead to exactly the situation feared by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. We are proceeding through the development of the plan in terms of the Secretary of State&#146;s necessary information and participation, so that we can create the framework which will obviate the noble Duke&#146;s anxiety and will, I hope, reassure the noble Baroness with regard to her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0902234000162"></a>Amendment 94ZA makes a small change to Clause 57(3), to replace the use of a marine policy document &#147;in force&#148; in the marine plan area with &#147;which is in effect&#148; instead.

I would welcome the Minister&#146;s clarification that there were no other non-devolved functions in respect of the Scottish offshore region; and that, if a plan under this part of the Act relates to fisheries, the approval of the Secretary of State would still be required as regards any plan for the Scottish offshore region. If that is the case, it is almost re-reserving to a limited extent. The Minister may argue that it is part of the settlement, but it is important that that be clarified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0902234000166"></a>Amendment 94A is to Clause 57&#151;we are going slightly ahead of ourselves, but the amendment is in this group&#151;where a marine plan for an area in a devolved marine planning region has to have a statement under Clause 49(7) that it contains provisions relating to a retained function. For the purposes of the part of the Act, subsection (7) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="0902234000266"></a>&#147;as respects the Scottish inshore region or the Scottish offshore region, functions relating to reserved matters, within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="0902234000215"></a>are to be defined as &#147;retained functions&#148;. Put simply, the amendment probes what functions relate to reserved matters and are exercised within the Scottish inshore region. I am sure that the Minister will be able to give us a list of those. If there are none the words will appear redundant but, if there are functions, who will be responsible for dealing with them in the plan for the Scottish inshore region? Will that matter, albeit it concerns &#147;retained functions&#148;, be dealt with by Scottish Ministers subject to the approval of the Secretary of State? Again, I seek clarification from the Minister as to what is covered by &#147;retained functions&#148; in the Scottish inshore region.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0902234000167"></a>The final three amendments, which relate to each other, are about the documentation and possible challenges to it in the courts. As I read Clause 59, an application may be made to the Court of Session or the High Court in respect of a document for a marine plan for an area outwith the English inshore region or the Welsh inshore region. If it is a matter relating to the Scottish offshore region, it appears that it can be raised in the High Court. Vice versa, if it relates to the English offshore region, it could be raised and litigated on in the Court of Session. This amendment would give the Court of Session exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising out of a challenge to a relevant document pertaining to the Scottish offshore region; in other circumstances, it would be the High Court. Where you have the geographical division, it seems natural to have the appropriate division of court jurisdiction as well. Maybe I have misread the Bill, but it did not seem that way. If it has to be the case that a matter relating to the Scottish offshore region could be raised in the High Court or vice versa, it would be interesting to know the ministerial justification.</p>

I was waiting with interest to hear him explain about the different courts and their jurisdictions in different areas. Can the noble Lord explain how there can be a difference in the treatment of reserved functions between inshore and offshore areas? This subject has interested me greatly since we started debating the Bill. The Minister will probably confirm that there are already more devolved powers in the offshore area than the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has spoken of, because powers were devolved under the Electricity Act. This means that all renewable energy in the offshore area, as well as all electricity generation, including all transmission lines and interconnectors, are devolved&#151;so if the Scots wish to keep all their electricity to themselves, they could almost cut it off at the border. We would like to hear the Minister&#146;s reply on this matter.</p>

The Minister has already dealt with some points concerning the powers of the Secretary of State. I agree with what  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_34"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my noble friend is attempting to do with the amendment as it relates to Scotland. With regard to the publication of a marine plan, it does not relate to retained functions as far as Wales is concerned. It is obvious that the Welsh offshore plan does not fall within the devolved functions of the Welsh Assembly. Paragraph 15(2) of Schedule 6, which has been discussed previously, relates to the powers of the Secretary of State. Sub-paragraph (3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="0902234000252"></a>&#147;Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a marine plan for the Welsh inshore region if the plan does not relate to retained functions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902234000216"></a>That solidifies the situation. However, the Welsh Assembly Government are bound to be concerned about the situation in the Welsh offshore region. Should they produce an offshore plan, which they may not have the competence to do&#151;I would like the Minister to clarify that&#151;could the Secretary of State veto it?</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0902234000170"></a>There are many environmental problems in the Irish Sea. One principle of the Government of Wales Act 1998 was sustainable biodiversity. This is a major statement in the Act. However, what would happen if a large infrastructure project was imminent, or serious inroads were threatened into the viability and sustainability of offshore fisheries? Although the Welsh Assembly has considerable powers in that area, what would happen if the environmental sustainability of the Welsh offshore region were put at risk? If the Welsh Assembly Government attempted to put this right by means of a marine plan for the offshore region, could that be done?</p>

I have been handed a most useful summary of the various powers which are proposed in this legislation and which exist under other legislation. It is a graphic and valuable illustration, which I shall make available to noble Lords as soon as possible. Had I had the sense to show it to Members of the Committee earlier, I might not have been involved in such intricacies on these amendments. It will clarify the issues greatly. I cannot possibly read it out as it would take an inordinate length of time and I am not sure I could make complete sense of it as it is in columns.

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0902234000172"></a>These amendments are interesting. We learnt from our previous discussions that this is a complex area of the Bill and a complex area generally. That is reflected in the drafting of this part of the Bill. It may be helpful if I set out how the devolution agreement works for marine planning in the Scottish inshore and offshore regions. There are two issues to be considered: first, the effect of the MPS on marine plans and, secondly, its effect on decisions. If Scottish Ministers adopt the marine policy statement, with the agreement of the Secretary of State&#151;an issue which we discussed earlier&#151;they will be able to prepare comprehensive marine plans for the Scottish offshore region. Those plans must be in conformity with the marine policy statement, unless relevant considerations apply, and  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_35"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be able to address matters which are devolved to Scotland, such as fisheries, renewable energy generation and some nature conservation functions, as well as matters which are reserved by the UK Parliament. This is obviously our preferred option, towards which both Administrations are committed to working.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0902234000173"></a>That is how the authorities should work together in the future. However, if, for any reason, Scottish Ministers do not adopt the marine policy statement, or if they decide at some stage to withdraw from it, their decisions and those of public authorities in Scotland which relate to devolved functions will not be bound by it. If they do not adopt the marine policy statement or withdraw from it, Scottish Ministers will be able to prepare marine plans only in respect of matters which are devolved to Scotland. I am sure that the Committee recognises the logic of that. Given the complex mix of devolved and reserved functions in the Scottish offshore region, the joint ministerial committee, to which I have made reference earlier, agrees that all plans for the Scottish offshore region should be subject to agreement by the Secretary of State whether or not they expressly make provision for functions which are not devolved.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0902234000174"></a>I reiterate that even if the Scottish Ministers do not adopt the marine policy statement, it will still apply to both the inshore and offshore regions in respect of all decisions in relation to functions which are not devolved. In other words, in the Bill the retained functions are defined in Clause 57.</p>

<a name="90223-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0902234000175"></a>Separately, Scottish Ministers are preparing a Scottish Marine Bill which will include provision for marine planning in the Scottish inshore<I></I>region. As their recent consultation document on the proposals for a Scottish Marine Bill says,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="0902234000253"></a>&#147;To apply marine planning provisions to reserved matters in these waters, the agreement of the UK Government would be needed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902234000176"></a>We are already in discussion with our Scottish colleagues to agree a mechanism that will enable the UK Government to signal our consent to these plans, so that both Administrations can enjoy the benefits of comprehensive marine planning for the Scottish inshore region. As I said earlier, the marine policy statement will apply to reserved matters throughout the UK marine area, including the Scottish inshore region, and we would expect any plan prepared under a Scottish Marine Bill that seeks to address reserved functions to conform to that policy statement.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0902234000179"></a>Amendment 89JA would allow Scottish Ministers to plan for the Scottish offshore region for devolved functions without the need for the agreement of the Secretary of State. That would extend the provision already made in respect of plans prepared by Welsh Ministers for devolved matters only in the Welsh inshore region. It may help if I explain why that provision for Welsh plans is there. Unlike in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Welsh Assembly cannot legislate for marine planning in the Welsh inshore region, so we have made provision for Welsh inshore planning in the Bill. However, under current devolution arrangements, Welsh Ministers have existing powers in the Welsh inshore region&#151;particularly in relation to protecting the marine environment&#151;which they currently exercise without the agreement of the Secretary of State. We have therefore included this provision to ensure that the existing devolution arrangements should not be curtailed by this Bill by a need for the Secretary of State to agree plans which cover only devolved matters&#151;to leave the status quo.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0902234000180"></a>Regarding the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, the position of the Scottish offshore region is different. It is not part of devolved Scotland, and although Scottish Ministers have significant functions in that region, they are by no means comprehensive. The Scottish offshore region comprises a significant part of the UK marine area and the UK, rather than the Scottish Executive, retains many key functions in the area, including those relating to international relations with other countries that share borders with that region.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0902234000181"></a>The second of these amendments, Amendment 94A, would remove the definition of &#147;retained functions&#148; as applied to &#147;the Scottish inshore region&#148;. We consider that that could damage the effect of the marine policy statement in that region by creating uncertainty over the decisions to which it should apply. As I explained earlier, if the Scottish Ministers adopt the MPS, it will apply to all decisions relating to the Scottish inshore region. If they do not, it will still apply to retained or reserved functions, so removing that definition would make it unclear which functions these are and threaten most the functions that are reserved to this Parliament. I understood that the noble Lord prefaced his remarks by saying this was a probing amendment. I hope it has probed a satisfactory enough reply from me for him to feel happy to withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0902234000182"></a>The remaining amendments, Amendments 97A, 97B and 97C, refer to Clause 59, which sets out how any person may challenge the content of the marine policy statement or marine plans in a court of law. They specifically deal with which court should be applied to. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, expressed his keen interest in this matter. It will be possible to appeal against a published marine policy statement or an adopted plan. Clause 59 provides that any person aggrieved by one of these documents or by a revision or replacement will be able to apply to the relevant court on the grounds that the document is not within the appropriate power or that a procedural requirement has not been complied with.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0902234000183"></a>The amendments limit the courts to which applicants could bring a case. For example, for matters relating to plans in inshore areas in England and Wales, the  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appropriate court will be the High Court, but the marine policy statement and plans for the English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish offshore areas may affect a wide range of interests in those areas. It is appropriate to allow for an application challenging the marine policy statement or a marine plan for part of the offshore region to be heard in the High Court or the Court of Session. Applicants can also challenge the marine policy statement in any superior court, and we are concerned that the effect of Amendment 97B would be to remove the provision relating to where applications challenging the marine policy statement should be brought. That is why we cannot accept it because it puts at risk the protection of UK interests in the Scottish offshore region, which are extensive, and the basis on which we have agreed the Bill in our discussions with the devolved Administrations.</p>

Is he saying that the Scottish Government have assented to a body, perhaps an oil company, wishing to challenge a provision relating to the marine plan for the Scottish offshore region doing so in the High Court in London as opposed to the Court of Session in Edinburgh? Does he not think that it is logical that if a matter relates to an area in Scottish jurisdiction for other purposes, it should fall to a court of the Scottish jurisdiction, not the High Court, and vice versa?</p>

I assure him that we have framed the Bill on the basis of discussions with the devolved Administrations, and they have looked at this matter with the greatest care, as he would expect.

We have not agreed to devolve offshore nature conservation executively but Welsh Ministers will be able to influence inshore conservation provisions through the marine policy statement and the marine plan, which can cover nature conservation with our consent. Authorities exercising functions in their region must consult and apply the marine policy statement&#151;the noble Lord will recognise the overarching significance of that&#151;but the point he raised is that Welsh Ministers will be able to influence provisions through that statement.</p>

I mentioned fisheries and the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, quite rightly reminded us that renewable energy is a function as well. The Minister seemed to be saying that he did not want to upset the current devolutionary arrangements for the Welsh inshore area but that there was to be some trade-off for the Scottish offshore area. Given the totality of other matters for which Scottish Ministers do not currently have responsibility, the trade-off might be worth while. It would be useful to have that on the record so that we can make a judgment. Likewise, with regard to the Scottish inshore area, the Minister seemed to indicate that important current functions would be reserved but that they would have to be set out in any marine plan that was brought forward. I want to look at what the Minister said in detail, but it has been helpful in giving us clarification.</p>

When that piece of paper is circulated, it will be helpful if we know whether we are talking about general conformity or strict conformity.

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0902234000191"></a>My final point relates to the question of court jurisdiction. I want to think about this, because I believe that the pass is being sold here and may indeed have been sold by Scottish Ministers. My colleagues in the Scottish Parliament will be fascinated that Mr Salmond and others were quite happy to trade off the jurisdiction of the Court of Session, if that is indeed what has happened; it is what I thought the Minister said. If matters happen to fall territorially within Scotland, the application should be to the Court of Session; if they fall territorially within England&#146;s offshore waters, they should fall to the High Court. Ultimately there will be an appeal to what, in time, will be the Supreme Court.</p>

Following the tragedy of Piper Alpha, there was a fatal accident inquiry as well as the inquiry of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen. That seemed to indicate that it was within the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts. With those comments and the possibility of revisiting the issue at a future time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0902234000195"></a>I have a general comment to make before I deal with the detail of the amendments. In a Bill as comprehensive and complex as this, it seems strange that the opportunity to include clear measures to improve the protection, management and enjoyment of our marine heritage has not been taken. I recognise from what the Minister has said on previous occasions that it may be argued that references to the marine heritage and the historic environment are implicit and that it may be pointed out that Clause 112(2), for example, refers to &#147;historic or archaeological interest&#148; in its definition of the environment, but there is insufficient clarity. I would have felt much happier if the amendment that my noble friend Lord Taylor proposed to Clause 2 earlier in Committee had been given a warmer welcome, as it would have made it clear early in the Bill that heritage and marine archaeology are within the scope of the Bill. This group of amendments was therefore   


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tabled to ensure that our marine heritage is not overlooked in the delivery of the duties of marine management, whether we are talking about marine planning or marine licensing, and in the designation of marine conservation zones.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0902234000196"></a>Amendment 89L would add &#147;historic&#148; and &#147;archaeological&#148; to the list of matters to be kept under review in Clause 52. As we already have a list, and as the Minister has said that such features will be taken into account in licensing, planning and so on, the amendment would ensure that equal weight was given to these features in considering policies on marine plan areas and would clearly distinguish them from more general social or cultural aspects.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0902234000197"></a>Amendments 101BZAA and 107D underline a similar point and would give recognition to the special status of statutory consultees in determining licence applications and in the consultation prior to the designation of a marine conservation zone. When I refer to statutory consultees, I mean mainly English Heritage. There is concern that English Heritage, as an adviser to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on the designation of historic wrecks under the 1973 Act, is not to be specifically consulted on proposals to designate an MCZ, which could have implications for its operations in relation to a designated wreck under the Act. The role of statutory consultees is very important in ensuring that decision-making is informed by independent and knowledgeable advice and that complete attention is given to all aspects of any proposal, subject to the decision of the Secretary of State. I believe that the Bill should differentiate between those bodies with a specific role and expertise and other generally interested persons to provide clarity and accountability in the decision-making process. As I have said, those comments apply equally to Amendments 101BZAA and 107D.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0902234000198"></a>Amendment 106CB, which would insert the words &#147;historic and cultural heritage&#148; in Clause 114, would enable the designation of a marine conservation zone on historic and cultural heritage grounds. It would help to ensure the integrated management of all features subject to conservation. Provisions for including the historic environment as supporting features of marine protected areas were included in the marine Bill Green Paper, which preceded this Bill. However, as it emerged, the Bill focuses on nature conservation as grounds for designating marine protected areas, as they were referred to in the Green Paper&#151;they have now been renamed &#147;marine conservation zones&#148;&#151;without any reference to the historic environment. The Bill should ensure that the historic environment is a factor in qualifying the interest of a location to be subject to marine protected area status. Such status would broaden the approach to management by ensuring that other activities that have the potential to impact marine archaeological resources are first assessed against the natural and historic conservation interests of the marine protected area.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0902234000199"></a>Amendment 107A would insert the words &#147;historic or archaeological&#148;. I believe that it is important that the grounds for designation of MCZs take full account of all other features that are subject to statutory protection&#151;again, the 1973 wrecks Act is an example&#151;or that could be subject to protection, including any  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_41"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>future legislation for historic and archaeological assets. If the MCZs do not do so, there could be conflict between their conservation objectives and the licensing of activities within them permitted by other legislation. In other words, there could be a recipe for confusion. As well as to protect our historic environment, we seek clarity and joined-up thinking.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0902234000200"></a>At this stage, these are probing amendments. I hope that the Minister will give us reassurance and a warmer welcome to this aspect than he has previously. I also hope that he will accept that there is considerable interest among a wide range of individuals and relevant organisations in getting this right. We want to be helpful and, as I have said, to ensure co-ordinated management between natural and historic features of the Bill to avoid potential conflict. I beg to move.</p>

Our purpose in tabling these amendments is to tighten up the language of the Bill, removing ambiguities and making it clear that the legislation is intended to protect the marine historic environment as well as the marine natural environment. I am grateful to the Minister, my noble friend Lord Hunt, for meeting the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, and myself and for the helpful discussion we had about that general issue and about these amendments in particular.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09022317000002"></a>Amendment 89L to Clause 52 clarifies that, in determining what are relevant matters for a marine plan authority to keep under review, the term cultural includes historic and archaeological. My noble friend may say, as has been said before in proceedings on this Bill, that the Government eschew lists which can be interpreted as excluding other matters that are not specifically included in them. I understand the force of that point generally, but it is not the point here. Here we are simply seeking elucidation of terms to clarify that the legislation is intended to protect the marine historic environment. If you were Neptune or Venus arising from the waves and reading the Bill as drafted for the first time, you would not be at all sure of that. The occasional references to cultural, historic and archaeological interest seem like an afterthought and not integral to the conception of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09022317000003"></a>Similarly Amendment 106CB amends Clause 114 to state forthrightly that an authority may designate a marine conservation zone for the purpose of conserving historic and cultural heritage. Without this amendment, it is by no means clear in the Bill that an authority could do so. Amendment 107A clarifies that the authority, in considering whether it is desirable to designate an area as a marine conservation zone, may have regard to the historic and archaeological consequences of doing so. Clause 114 as drafted as far as subsection (6) is exclusively concerned with the natural heritage. The addition in subsection (7) of permission to have regard to economic or social consequences of designation fails to indicate that the authority may also have regard to the consequences for the marine historic environment. The Bill should explicitly require a balanced concern for the various aspects of the environment,

The Bill should also point the way towards reconciling the tensions that there could sometimes be between the needs of different important aspects of the environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09022317000004"></a>Amendment 101BZAA to Clause 66 and Amendment 107D to Clause 116 are designed to make clear that bodies charged with a duty to advise the Government on relevant matters and to undertake relevant executive functions on their behalf must be consulted during those processes of taking decisions that will have important consequences for the marine historic environment. Amendment 101BZAA clarifies that in determining an application for a marine licence the licensing authority must have regard to representations not only from,</p>
<ul><a name="09022317000110"></a>&#147;any person having an interest in the outcome of the application&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09022317000097"></a>but also specifically from statutory consultees. Consulting the wider public of people who are interested is right and proper, but we need to make a distinction between that and consultation with organisations that have relevant duties under statute. Amendment 107D similarly clarifies that before designating a marine conservation zone an authority must consult statutory consultees as well as any other persons likely to be interested. Persons &#147;likely to be interested&#148;, in the wording of the Bill, is an odd way to refer to statutory bodies which have clear responsibilities in this area&#151;as English Heritage has in relation to the marine historical environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09022317000005"></a>Politically it will be helpful to the Government to make it an avowed principle to consult the relevant non-departmental public bodies. They are different from non-governmental organisations. They are set up by government as independent and expert bodies. A legally binding and clear obligation to consult with them will help to persuade the interested public that the Government genuinely wish to get their decisions right. Such consultation provides a form of audit and accountability.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09022317000006"></a>My noble friend may say that there is no such thing as a statutory consultee and that it is not a term recognised in government. While it may not be an elegant term, it precisely describes something that matters, so why do we not coin it as a useful legislative term? If he really does not like it, we could perhaps use instead the terminology of &#147;partner authorities&#148; that the Government themselves are using in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill. My noble friend may otherwise say that the amendments are unnecessary since by definition statutory consultees must be consulted. That is true in theory, but busy people do not always remember to consult everyone they ought to consult, or appreciate the status of the responses they receive. Bureaucratic jealousies do occur and co-operation between departments can be less than perfect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09022317000007"></a>I readily accept that Defra Ministers and officials are working with DCMS and English Heritage at present. Defra is a signatory to English Heritage&#146;s funding agreement and has, I understand, commissioned English Heritage to prepare a position statement on marine development control. Defra, DCMS and English Heritage work together very well on the Aggregates

English Heritage is a fundholder under this Defra scheme, which supports much archaeological work, including the examination of &#147;Dogger Land&#148; under the North Sea and the use of new survey technology to study shipwreck sites on the Goodwin Sands. I am not at all saying, therefore, that there is not at present good co-operation. Ministers are, however, birds of passage. I have watched with admiration how my noble friend Lord Hunt has swooped from one portfolio to another. Civil servants, despite the mythology, are not permanent, and the institutional memory in Whitehall can be amnesiac. There are pressures on Defra to subordinate its concern for the marine historic environment arising, for example, from the international agreement to deliver an ecological network of marine protected areas by, I think, 2012. Nature conservation NGOs are pushing hard for ecological and biodiversity interests alone in this network, and that makes it hard for the archaeology NGOs to play their part in achieving co-ordinated action for the benefit of conservation overall.</p>

<a name="90223-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09022317000008"></a>The terms of this major legislation should make it unambiguously clear that duties to conserve are duties to conserve the historic as well as the natural environment. We understand why my noble friend Lord Hunt does not intend to attempt a definition of &#147;sustainable&#148; in the Bill, but I do ask the Government to state, in lapidary terms, on the record in <I>Hansard</I>, that when they speak of sustainability and when they legislate on sustainability and conservation, they intend that these terms and these duties embrace the historic as well as the natural environment. Successor officials, and, indeed, the courts, must have no doubt of this.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09022317000009"></a>I have noticed that Defra&#146;s document, <I>A Strategy for Promoting an Integrated Approach to the Management of Coastal Areas in England</I>, while emphatic on the need for a joined-up approach, and while acknowledging the historic environment in its vision, is, like this Bill, overwhelmingly focused on the natural environment. That is appropriate in a Bill originating from Defra. What causes me concern in that document, however, is the account of what the Government intend in the UK marine policy statement. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09022317000104"></a>&#147;The statement will bring together social, economic and environmental policies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022317000098"></a>It makes no reference to policies for the cultural and historic heritage. Yet the national policy statement will, on behalf of the Government as a whole, set the terms of reference for marine planning and conservation. I ask my noble friend to state that the MPS will set out the policy of the Government to safeguard the marine historic environment. I also ask him to make clear on the face of the Bill at the crucial points the Government&#146;s commitment to the cultural and historic marine heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09022317000010"></a>We must not fluff this legislation, as has happened too often in the past. The Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 was, I have been told, a narrowly-intended emergency measure originating as a Private Member&#146;s Bill. It is incapable of bearing the load that we may hope to place upon it. It is doubtful, for example, whether its provisions will help us in relation to the discovery the other day by a commercial salvage firm of divers of the remains of the first HMS &#147;Victory&#148;, yet the extent of the media coverage and intensity of public interest

The 2002 legislation, also introduced as a Private Member&#146;s Bill, though it drew on a previous government Bill that had not been enacted, was similarly insufficiently comprehensive. The Government&#146;s heritage protection Bill, though not a wreck, has not surfaced in this Session. I believe that the Secretary of State is trying to navigate it into port, but he has not got there yet.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09022317000011"></a>Meanwhile, we have this Bill. I do not suggest that it should not primarily be about the marine natural environment, or that it should be made to substitute for the heritage protection Bill, but I would argue that it should very clearly create a part of the legislative structure that we need for the conservation of the marine historic environment.</p>

But if we are trying to get that right then, where we have other national priorities concerning the quality and character of our existence, it is not enough just to leave them to be taken into consideration as a kind of appendix in which there are certain moral obligations, they have to be central to the whole strategy. If we care about heritage then it is not something that just has to be taken into account, it is something that is central to the whole design.

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09022317000015"></a>I and my noble friends Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lord Greaves have an amendment in this group, which we are calling the &#147;heritage group&#148;. However, I also support the other amendments. They may offer different courses but they are all aimed towards the same target. It is important that we discuss these issues in the round. I am grateful that I was in the Chamber to hear the noble Lord, Lord Judd&#151;who I know spoke from the heart, because he has a long record of interests in these matters&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, who has taken such an active interest in these particular concerns.</p>

I am particularly interested in the example of Lundy Island, where a nature reserve contains two historic wrecks designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. The possibility of confusion in a situation like that is great. It is also true around the Isles of Scilly, in which I also have a close interest, that if we are not careful and do not find ways of making the various organisations&#151;be they less or more formal, quangos or, as they are more properly designated, NGOs&#151;we will lose out substantially on important parts of our heritage. In that context, I pay particular tribute to the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, which has also expressed anxiety about this.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09022317000017"></a>Amendment 106CA, in my name and the names of my noble friends, is an attempt to build in to the requirements of Clause 114 a specific reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="09022317000111"></a>&#147;features or defined areas of sea or tidal waters, including the coastline, of natural beauty or cultural significance or a combination of any of these reasons&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022317000099"></a>It therefore falls into the same category that other noble Lords have already referred to. The amendment attempts to define areas of sea and their contiguous coastline where land or tidal features need to be designated on grounds of natural beauty or cultural, archaeological or geological heritage.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09022317000018"></a>The Bill should contain a presumption in favour of designating areas of this sort, particularly when we already have long established, well recognised and well accepted designations made under the national park regime, for example, or as areas of outstanding natural beauty or as heritage coasts. It would be extraordinary if all that legislation, which is so well supported and so well bedded down in this country, was treated as less important than this new legislation. It would also be welcome if world heritage sites such as the Jurassic coasts of Dorset and Devon were included in the criteria for protection under the MCZs. The Government have expressed interest in enhancing protection for the WHS designation; here is a useful opportunity to do just that.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09022317000019"></a>Views over the sea from land are an integral part of the coastal landscape. Coastal waters and the coastline are indivisible in terms of the natural processes at work which create the coastal morphology and the visual integrity of land and sea when viewed from land. Coastline viewed from the sea is similarly indivisible from the marine setting. The CPRE is right to regard the absence of landscape and visual criteria from the designation criteria for MCZs as a serious omission. I hope that the Minister will find some way to remedy that in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09022317000020"></a>The Government have already shown the importance they attach to the concept of landscape by ratifying the European landscape convention. English Heritage has conducted a historic characterisation of seascapes similar to its historic characterisation of landscapes. This analysis lends further weight to the case for including the protection and enhancement of coastal and sea landscapes in the Bill as it is intended to designate the protection of the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09022317000021"></a>For many of our fellow citizens the clearest and most relevant manifestation of the marine environment is the view of it from the land or from the surface of  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_46"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the sea. The CPRE is right to believe that understanding the sea and its wildlife is largely achieved through cherishing that view of the sea and its coastline. Natural England has recognised the great importance of this experience in putting the enhancement of coastal access at the heart of this marine Bill. Therefore, it is logical that we should bring landscapes including the sea within the remit of the MCZs. That would complete this vital legislation, which otherwise will leave a major element of the marine environment unprotected. I believe that the Minister recognises the significance of this whole group of amendments and I hope he will be able to respond very positively.</p>

I had intended to speak at Second Reading but had to withdraw due to the timetabling of that debate. If I had spoken, I would have focused my remarks almost entirely on the coastal aspect part of the Bill, which we have still to get to. Perhaps one day we will get there. Indeed, it was only when I read the notable contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, that I became aware of the issues we are discussing and their importance. That was rather myopic on my part, perhaps inadequately excused by my past chairmanship of the National Trust which, for the most part, is not terribly concerned with the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09022317000023"></a>We are quintessentially a marine nation with a huge marine heritage, which is as important as our terrestrial heritage. The marine heritage must include, and be concerned with, the issues covered by this group of amendments. It is, indeed, curious that the Bill is virtually silent in this area, perhaps because the issues were expected to be dealt with in the heritage Bill, which has never seen the light of day.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09022317000024"></a>Be that as it may, I congratulate the noble Baroness on seeking to remedy that deficiency with this group of amendments, and I am thankful that they have been included in a single group, which makes it much easier and more logical. They hang together as they are all of a kind, although they relate to various parts of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09022317000025"></a>I shall not go over the amendments in detail as this has already been done, particularly in the notable intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. As always, he speaks with knowledge and great authority. For example, the word &#147;cultural&#148; which has been used in Clause 52 is surely too imprecise. It is all very well for people to say, &#147;Well, everybody knows it includes the sort of things that we are talking about&#148;, but as noble Lords have said, civil servants and others can forget at times. It is rather a vogue word today, which I always find rather disturbing. So in this important area of marine history and archaeology the wording needs to be more specific and we need Amendment 89L.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09022317000026"></a>Similarly, in Clause 114, which deals with the grounds for MCZ designation, the word &#147;social&#148; needs to be buttressed in the same way&#151;hence Amendment 107A. In addition, it is surely important to refer at the two related points to the statutory consultees to ensure, as has been said by previous speakers that we are reminded that English Heritage, for example, has a statutory

I hope that the Government can find a way to include these amendments in the Bill, or something like them, when we get to the next stage.</p>

My noble friend is right to draw attention to the fact that there is much interest in this subject and evidence of support for these amendments.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09022317000029"></a>The gracious Speech for this Session was extremely disappointing for those interested in preserving our marine environment and adequately providing for archaeological conservation. The much needed and eagerly anticipated heritage protection Bill has been shelved, but just as with the Planning Act 2008, which ignored the Bill that we are now considering, this Bill was introduced without provisions necessary to ensure that the new marine planning legislation includes and properly safeguards our historic heritage which lies under the sea. Our island history is largely maritime. The work on the wreck of the HMS &#147;Victory&#148; off the Channel Islands shows how important our maritime heritage is to our understanding of the past.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09022317000030"></a>The Minister will no doubt point to the draft heritage protection Bill to explain why these provisions are missing. After all, that draft Bill went into great detail and it is no doubt the best vehicle for a comprehensive and consistent policy towards the UK&#146;s heritage. But the Government have decided not to bring it forward. As much as we on these Benches support that Bill, it can do no good in draft. That may be a shock for some in the Government, but statements of intent and press releases are not as effective as enforceable legislation, and the Government should not act as if they are.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09022317000031"></a>Protecting historic and archaeological sites should not be considered an optional extra to be added on when the Government find a convenient moment. They should be looking for ways of making sure that protection can be ensured now to prevent further damage until the draft Bill can be introduced and to ensure that these provisions will interact appropriately and efficiently with the heritage objective.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09022317000032"></a>I also agree with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, which provides for&#151;I paraphrase&#151;an area of outstanding natural beauty designation for coastal aspects and seascapes. The interaction of sea and land is the source of some of the most beautiful aspects of our country. I feel strongly that the Government should provide for marine heritage protection with this Bill. Not to do so would represent a lost opportunity.</p>

Will the Minister tell us why it was then dropped and whether that was due to the proposed heritage Bill that has not now happened? Even if the answer is yes, should the Government not think again about the opportunity provided by this Bill to ensure that it is included? Having taken through the House the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and one or two others, I know that sometimes an opportunity moves by too quickly. Unless there is a very good reason why the provision was not included when it was originally intended to be in the Bill, we should like to persuade the Minister to think again. I look forward to his response.</p>

She will have derived a great deal of encouragement from the anticipated support she has had from all sides of the House. I know that noble Lords take the issue of our heritage&#151;our marine heritage in this context&#151;very seriously.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09022317000035"></a>The Bill spans a great deal of policy as well as a vast area of sea. The Government intend the marine policy statement and marine plans to address the interests and concerns of all those who are connected with the sea. Protecting our marine historic environment is important in our management of the marine environment more generally. We have ensured protection for these aspects within our high level marine objectives, which we issued for consultation last summer. These objectives will underpin the development of the marine policy statement which will then be applied in more detail in specific areas via marine plans. In response to the points put forward with his usual precision by my noble friend Lord Howarth, while there will be a number of national policy statements that we cannot pre-empt at this stage, I put it on the record that the marine policy statement will indeed set out the Government&#146;s policy on safeguarding the marine environment, which will include cultural and historic marine heritage. Those documents will then drive decisions made in the marine area, so I hope that the Committee will appreciate that heritage protection will in a very real sense feature in decisions that are made.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09022317000036"></a>Of course, the Government are committed to sustainability. In response to my noble friend Lord Howarth this embraces the concept of the historic as well as the natural environment. The purpose of the nature conservation proposals in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill is to protect the natural environment. We have concluded that history and archaeology are very specialised areas of policy requiring equally specialised provisions. That is why we have been drafting a new heritage protection Bill. I make this point in response to a number of noble Lords who have spoken, the most recent of whom was the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. We have been unable to give the heritage protection Bill space in this Session&#146;s legislative programme. The Government regret that, in the current economic climate, there are other pressing priorities, but we will bring that Bill forward as soon as parliamentary time allows.

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09022317000037"></a>I am grateful that the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, has introduced Amendment 89L. It gives us a chance to air these important issues and for me to give some reassurance that they form part of the Government&#146;s marine planning, which is the basis of this Bill. Amendment 89L relates to the matters that the marine plan authority must keep under review while exercising its planning functions. As stated in the Bill, they include physical, environmental, social, cultural and economic characteristics. I listened carefully to both the noble Lady and my noble friend Lord Howarth, who said that this list was not precise enough, although &#147;social, cultural and economic&#148; seems sufficiently broad to encompass the issues that they address with their amendments. The list of things that Clause 52 requires the planning authority to keep under review is indeed broad. It is certainly broad enough to include matters of historical and archaeological interest, without specific mention in the legislation. If it will help, I am happy to put it on record that we firmly intend that issues of historical and archaeological interest should be considered and addressed in marine plans.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09022317000038"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, asked in his contribution, why is the list of objectives not more specific about cultural and&#151;in particular&#151;archaeological or historic matters? I think my noble friend Lord Judd also reflected on this. We intend to address those issues in much greater detail in due course, and to answer all noble Lords&#146; questions on these matters. However, I emphasise that this Bill does not exclude the important considerations that noble Lords have brought to the attention of the House this afternoon. There will be very few cases where there will be a risk that designating a marine conservation zone might have an adverse impact on marine heritage. We do not consider, given the range of consultations that are necessary and the objectives that the authorities must follow, that this Bill is anything except benign and constructive with regard to these significant issues.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09022317000039"></a>Amendments 106CA and 106CB seek to add the protection of historic and cultural heritage, as well the conservation of cultural significance, to the reasons for marine conservation zone-designations, which are set out in Clause 114. I understand the pressure for this from noble Lords and have some sympathy for the thrust of the amendment. I have already alluded to the need for specialised provisions to protect adequately our marine heritage. The same is true of marine nature conservation. The Bill sets out a system of protective measures specifically designed for natural environment conservation purposes. I consider that the results that we want in these two areas of policy do not overlap sufficiently for us to be able to use exactly the same tools for both. That is why we intend to bring the heritage protection Bill before Parliament in due course. That does not alter the fact that the protection of historic and cultural heritage is an important part of the work of this Bill.</p>

We will have a chance to debate that later when we look at the conservation of visual beauty in Part 5 of the Bill. I recognise that the noble Lord has located the amendment in this group for the purpose of supporting the general issues of cultural heritage.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09022317000041"></a>On the question of statutory consultees, who could disagree with the objective of this amendment? It seeks to ensure that the relevant expert advice is taken into account when making certain decisions. We agree with that point and have drafted the Bill to ensure that it happens. However, there is a problem with including lists of statutory consultees in the Bill. Our approach is, rather, to require the bodies taking decisions to consult all those people who are likely to take an interest in, or be affected by, these decisions. That should be clear. We expect to issue guidance, where appropriate, to indicate whom bodies should normally consider consulting when taking decisions. Where the marine historic environment is relevant to a decision, that guidance will say that obvious experts in marine heritage, such as English Heritage, should be consulted.</p>

<a name="90223-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09022317000042"></a>I particularly appreciate the sharpness with which my noble friend Lord Howarth presented the point that unless people or organisations are listed, they can be overlooked. He will forgive me if I say that, within the framework of the Bill, we are certainly making sure that there is provision for our cultural and historic heritage. If we look in that framework at the marine environment and marine heritage, it is unthinkable that consultation could take place without English Heritage having its full opportunity for consultation. This approach will be quite as effective as lists of consultees. After all, the problem with lists of consultees&#151;I am not for a moment suggesting this in the context of English Heritage&#151;is that they go out of date because bodies change their names or designation. We are making provision in the Bill for the objectives that the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, brought to our attention in her initial amendment. We will certainly ensure that English Heritage will be consulted wherever aspects of the marine conservation zones and marine plan are developed that affect anything to do with our heritage at sea. I give way to my noble friend.</p>

It is required to consult each London borough council, and the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, alias English Heritage; I am very pleased to see that there.

Even less significant bodies than the devolved authorities have a part to play in the development of marine plans and marine conservation zones. Therefore, we are reluctant to put into the legislation&#151;on which in so many of the local dimensions it is important that bodies have their say&#151;a national list which might look pre-emptive over them. That is why I am not persuaded of the virtues of the amendment.</p>

That is why we are putting forward two positions. This Bill necessarily is drawn in fairly broad terms with regard to marine heritage, because of the other considerations that inevitably are of great significance within the framework of the legislation. However, we will pursue the heritage protection Bill in due course. Noble Lords will accept that we have that Bill in draft, and we merely await the parliamentary opportunity to introduce it. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will feel that on an important part of this Bill they have pressed their case for concern for the historic environment within British waters, and that the Bill provides the opportunity for the Government to fulfil our obligations in this respect. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_52"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has to be aimed for, and here we have a perfectly appropriate Bill in which these provisions could perfectly appropriately be included. As my noble friend Lady Byford said earlier, people are now kicking themselves that, when the Countryside and Rights of Way Act went through your Lordships&#146; House in 2000, the marine references were not included. Now, nine years later, in spite of assurances, they are still not apparent anywhere. It is not particularly helpful to put our faith in a Bill which may well be wonderful when it comes about, but on which even the Minister was very clear that it would come only &#147;in due course&#148;. That could mean anything; not soon, not in the near future; nothing at all helpful or hopeful. I am glad to hear that the marine policy statement will include explicit references to marine heritage and to the historic importance of various sites and objects on our coastline, and I look forward to hearing a bit more about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09022317000050"></a>The issue of statutory consultees was not adequately covered. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, in speaking to the amendment, made the position perfectly clear and, in questioning the Minister, asked for further help, and did not get it. An organisation such as English Heritage has a special status. It is not just an interested person or body. It may well be that &#147;statutory consultee&#148; is not a felicitous term; perhaps we should find some other way of describing them. There has to be some way in which we can get this very important requirement in the Bill, to give comfort to those who are interested in this issue and who wish to play their part fully, to ensure that their role is not overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09022317000051"></a>I am not entirely happy with the Minister&#146;s response on this occasion.

I hope that we have been consistent in our argument. Certainly there is no ambiguity in this amendment. It would ensure that, if there were to be any delegation of planning functions to a public body outside the areas devolved to Scotland, that body would be the MMO. That is, I understand, the Government&#146;s very sensible intention, so we would like to see that intention set out on the face of the Bill. </p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09022317000054"></a>The Minister will no doubt say that flexibility is needed in the event that the MMO proves incapable of exercising these functions effectively. Surely, however, if that were the case, the Secretary of State would, first, withdraw the functions back into the department and, secondly, reconsider the whole approach to marine planning, with the appropriate legislation following. Watching the MMO fail and not taking the proper steps to dissolve it and to replace it with a more effective body would be the worst possible way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09022317000055"></a>Of course, this principle also applies to marine licensing. Although I have not tabled an amendment to that part of the Bill, I hope and trust that the Government&#146;s intentions are to delegate the relevant licensing powers to the MMO. However, this is nowhere indicated in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister might consider ways in which this could be made more explicit in the wording of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09022317000100"></a>Surely the Welsh Assembly is a public body. I know that the Minister has said that co-operation between Welsh Ministers and the MMO will be the procedure. I really find the exclusion of the Welsh Assembly in this context unacceptable.</p>

I would also like to comment on the wording of his amendment. It would have the effect of limiting to the MMO the public body to which the Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland could delegate their marine planning functions. It would be unusual to place a greater limit on the discretion of the Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to choose their delegate than is placed on Scottish Ministers. We certainly would start from the premise that each marine plan authority should have equal status, including in their ability to choose a suitable delegate to carry out their planning functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09022317000059"></a>Let me make it clear that we intend to delegate our planning functions in the English inshore and offshore regions to the MMO, but we disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, on the virtue of limiting ourselves to doing so under this Bill. He has anticipated the reasons why we will resist his amendment. The system is new. We are pretty convinced that we have got it right and that this is the best way to do it, but changes to the remit of the MMO might need to be made in the future, which might mean that it would no longer be the best body to carry out marine planning. In those circumstances, we do not want to be tied by statute to delegating marine planning functions only to that body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09022317000060"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has said, &#147;Well, if that were the case, it would show that the whole system was not working, and the Government would have to come back to your Lordships&#146; House and the other place with new legislation&#148;. However, marine legislation does not come along very often. We heard in the previous debate about legislation that was long anticipated but, alas, had not quite reached your Lordships&#146; House. There is a genuine concern that, if we were to specify the MMO as he wants to, the result could be very inflexible if there were changes to be made in the future in the light of experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09022317000063"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked me to interpret &#147;public body&#148;. Clause 312&#151;&#147;Interpretation&#148;&#151;on page 206 makes it clear that a public body includes a government department, a Northern Ireland department, a local authority, a local planning authority or a statutory undertaker, although there is a further definition in relation to that in Clause 312(2).</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09022317000064"></a>We think that we should retain some flexibility here, to keep the option open of delegating specific functions within planning to specialist bodies. There are circumstances in which we might want some other body than the MMO to perform, for example, public consultation elements if there were a good reason for that.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09022317000065"></a>We have had debates on the Severn. I have explained why there cannot be a joint plan, because of the devolution settlement, but there can be a lot of working well together. It would be possible for UK and Welsh Ministers to direct the same cross-border body to undertake public consultation in relation to both plans&#151;both the Welsh plan and the plan covering the English part of the Severn environment. We think that there needs to be a degree of flexibility. We certainly do not think it appropriate to designate the MMO as the marine plan authority. We believe that the adoption of plans is a policy decision that should remain at ministerial level. That is why we have provided a mechanism in

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09022317000066"></a>I know that, behind the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is a concern that the MMO will not have the degree of authority that he wishes it to have. I well understand that concern. However, we have deliberately set up the MMO as an independent body&#151;a non-departmental public body. That gives the organisation the independence and status that it needs to deliver on behalf of the Government as a whole.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09022317000067"></a>The marine environment covers policy areas of direct interest to nearly every central government department&#151;defence, shipping, ports, renewable energy, fisheries, aggregates, the environment, recreation and more. While the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will be the sponsor Minister, the organisation will deliver on behalf of all departments. It will be better able to deliver with the new marine planning system, with objectivity and propriety on behalf of the UK Government. It will have a crucial role, building on the experience of fisheries and environmental licensing to deliver more joined-up decisions and a much better and faster one-stop-shop service to developers. It will play a key role in integrated coastal zone management, in helping to deliver important reforms and link conservation with fisheries management, and in managing and regulating a new and flexible tool to enable conservation benefits to be delivered, while encouraging important economic developments such as marine renewable energy to proceed.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09022317000068"></a>These are major policies that run through the Bill. They mostly arise because of the need to deal with the increasing and conflicting pressures on the sea. We are equipping the MMO to deliver sustainable development in the marine environment. There should be no question about the importance of the Marine Management Organisation, or that we wish to fetter it in any way, apart from in the terms in which it undertakes its duties in accordance with the Bill. In the end, it ought to be up to each marine plan authority whom to delegate their functions to. I have made it clear that, as the UK Government, we will delegate those functions to the Marine Management Organisation. However, we retain the right for some flexibility in future if required. It would not be appropriate to limit Welsh Ministers and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to using a UK government non-departmental public body. Those Administrations ought to be allowed to make decisions on the arrangements that work best for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09022317000069"></a>I reiterate to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;I hope that he will agree&#151;that the Marine Management Organisation will be extremely important and that it has the powers to do the job that we have set out for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09022317000071"></a>I suspect that this is likely to be a bit of a running argument throughout the Bill. We know from the early stages of our proceedings on the Bill that the Minister was keen to vest in the MMO the authority that he manifested in the speech that he just gave. However, we are not entirely sure why there is a certain withdrawal at this point in the Bill. If it is the Government&#146;s intention to vest the authority of the Secretary of State and the planning authority for England in the MMO, why do they not say so in the Bill? What circumstances could arise in which the MMO was not the capable body? If the MMO performs badly as an executive function, that will need to be addressed by the Government. The powers vested in the MMO will have to be exercised in some way or another through some body or another, and that body needs to be the MMO, as the Government have clearly decided. I find it hard to understand why they draw back from putting that into the Bill at this stage. It would enhance the authority that the Government are seeking to vest in the MMO. From this Bench our view is that, if we want adequate authority from that body, we should make it clear that it has the full authority of legislation.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09022317000074"></a>As the Bill stands, it seems to my noble friend that there is a lesser test relating to the marine policy documents&#151;the policy and the plan&#151;when the application is to the Infrastructure Planning Commission than with an application for authorisation by the Marine Management Organisation. The IPC will be subject to a requirement to have regard to the appropriate marine policy documents, but in other cases&#151;where we are dealing with an authorisation or enforcement decision by the Marine Management Organisation&#151;the decision must be in accordance with the appropriate marine policy documents unless relevant considerations indicate otherwise. Amendments 91 and 92 remove that exception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09022317000075"></a>Our other two amendments in the group are more specific. Amendment 93 is about offshore energy and would remove generation of more than 100 megawatts from the Infrastructure Planning Commission and put it into the marine regime. My noble friend describes this as a bit of kite-flying; he might not thank me for repeating that, of course. If there is to be a marine planning regime, it should cover everything. We had difficulty on the then Planning Bill in anticipating this legislation but, now that we have this large and generally admirable Bill, we find that decisions of the Infrastructure Planning Commission could ride roughshod over the new marine regimes. We know that the Government want to co-ordinate everything. Part of our task is to see whether it is co-ordinated.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09022317000076"></a>We accept the need for security of energy supply, but should it take precedence over other marine considerations and should it fall within this legislation and be dealt with in the way that this legislation compares and balances the different matters that need to be taken into account? We find ourselves in the ironic position where an application for a smaller development for generating less energy will be taken into the balancing judgment of the Bill but, with a substantial generation of more than 100 megawatts, you can somehow leave all that aside, at any rate so far as concerns this legislation.</p>

<a name="90223-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09022317000077"></a>Amendment 94 is about decisions taken by the Infrastructure Planning Commission. It states that the marine policy statement and marine plans are the policies that should be relevant, rather than national policy statements. I tabled amendments referring to the potential conflict within the marine policy statement. This extends to the national policy statement. Again, the Government told us in effect not to worry because there will be proper co-ordination, but we are concerned about which should prevail if there is a conflict. I beg to move.</p>

My view is that where a marine policy statement exists, all marine projects should be made in accordance with it&#151;otherwise what is the point of having it?&#151;and in accordance with the associated marine plans. The clauses that exempt decisions on nationally significant infrastructure projects at sea were late entries into the field and are a detrimental step, because the IPC is required only to have regard to the marine policy statement and marine plans, rather than take decisions in line with them. Now that we have a Marine and Coastal Access Bill, marine projects should be considered within the framework that the marine planning process provides.</p>

<p><a name="09022317000102"></a>As I have mentioned previously, in Committee on the Planning Bill my noble friend Lord Taylor said that he was unhappy about the fact that the IPC was considered above the MMO when it came to offshore developments, or those greater than 100 megawatts. We are still concerned. It is important to join up these two disparate and inextricably linked pieces of legislation and to make sure that marine plans are given the authority that they deserve. We on these Benches want to achieve consistency, clarity and effective marine management with the Bill. Therefore we agree that the IPC should have to make decisions in accordance with,</p>
<ul><a name="09022317000113"></a>&#147;the appropriate marine policy documents&#148;.</ul>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09022317000081"></a>We are also concerned that the relationship between the MMO and the IPC should be properly scrutinised and appropriately defined in the Bill. We have introduced our two amendments to the Planning Act 2008 with the intention of delineating this relationship, not only to make it clearer but also to ensure that it suitably reflects concerns about the marine area and the authority of the MMO.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09022317000082"></a>Amendment 95 ensures that there is a duty to consult the MMO when making applications for development relating to coastal and offshore areas. It also ensures that the IPC must give notice inviting a local impact report to the MMO, even if only part of the application is considered coastal or offshore.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09022317000083"></a>Our second amendment makes sure that the national policy statement created by the IPC can cover marine areas, but only if it is subject to approval by the MMO. In addition, when the Secretary of State is developing the NPS, he must have regard both to marine policy statements and marine plans.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09022317000084"></a>These amendments are crucial to the working of the Bill. If the MMO is to be a functional and effective body, it cannot be subject to, and subservient to, the IPC and NPS. This is a difficult area, because the complexities of the relationship between land and sea, and the various developments, mean that it is not possible simply to divide one from the other. We need to employ subtleties to make sure that the MMO does not become just another quango that has to obey the IPC.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09022317000085"></a>Our amendments provide a solution to this thorny problem by integrating the Planning Act with the marine Bill in a way that ensures that neither the IPC nor the MMO is rendered ineffectual. Instead, they are encouraged to work together to make sure that both land and sea can be part of a broader plan of sustainable development.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09022317000086"></a>There is also the issue of who says no when the cumulative effect of human activities at sea is too harmful to the marine environment. This ability and need to say no is required by an EU directive. Who will say no? It presumably will not be the Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, or indeed the Secretary of State in charge of the IPC. We believe that it should be the MMO. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s answer to this. If the final say lies not with the MMO but with the Secretary of State for Defra, will it be made on the advice of the MMO? During the passage of the Planning Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that the relationship between the IPC and the MMO would be made plain during the course of this Bill. Perhaps the moment has now come and I look forward to his clarification.</p>

I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, that we have come to the crunch point&#151;in a different sense from the economic crunch. The relationship between the MMO and the IPC is absolutely crucial. Had we had the marine Bill before the Planning Bill, I believe that most of the contents of these amendments would have been contained within that marine Bill and that the Planning Act would be a somewhat different Act of Parliament from what it is.</p>

I can see that the will to drive through the targets for renewable energy impact on both the Planning Act and this Bill. We have not got the balance right between conservation and the production of renewable energy. I believe that the Planning Act could have taken care of part of this without forgoing the importance of conservation. If the MMO were the lead body, which I believe it most definitely should be, there is nothing wrong in it having due regard to the importance of climate change. This is a very important debate and I hope that the Minister will respond sympathetically to the point, which I am sure will be made by others shortly.</p>

We debated these issues on the Planning Bill, and we did so in anticipation of the marine Bill. It is somewhat puzzling that 12, 13, 14 weeks after the House has disposed of an issue we are called on to amend that legislation. Of course, it is entirely within the provenance of the House to do so&#151;I do not argue with that&#151;but at the very least it is puzzling that Members should seek so soon to change absolutely critical provisions in the Planning Bill.</p>

A paragraph on the relationship between the marine policy statements and the national policy statements talks about a government commitment to ensuring consistency between MPSs and NPSs and ensuring that the MMO and the IPC can work effectively. It said:</p>
<ul><a name="09022317000114"></a>&#147;because the Planning Bill has not yet completed its transition through Parliament, we will need to keep these issues under review&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022317000103"></a>The Planning Bill has now completed its progress through Parliament and those issues were unresolved during that progress. I suggest that the Government now need to continue to keep those issues under review and consider seriously our amendments.</p>

I thought that there was great clarity about the threshold in relation to offshore renewables, which essentially is what we are talking about, and the relationship and the role of the IPC in relation to that.</p>

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="09022317000092"></a><b><a name="90223-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022317000147"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> I do not buy that at all. It was not resolved in the Planning Bill. During proceedings on the Planning Bill the Minister said that the MMO would be able to say no to an application of the IPC. When we came to discuss it in this Bill, the Minister slightly changed his attitude on how the MMO would be able to say no to a planning application of the IPC. I agree with the noble Baroness: I do not believe that the issue was resolved under the Planning Bill, so we have to bring it back now.</p>

Clearly, it is an important one. I do not really agree with the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, when he says that we do not have the balance right between renewables and conservation. I do not want to reopen our great debates on Clause 2 about contributing to sustainable development, but I believe that we have the balance right. The intent of national policy statements is to bring together all relevant government policy, including relevant marine policy, and that is to be the primary factor for IPC decisions in the new, single consent regime. Of course, the national policy statement, which will cover the offshore renewables situation, will, like the marine policy statement, be widely consulted on and scrutinised by Parliament. I also point out that the Planning Act provides that the national policy  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_61"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statement will not be the only factor. The IPC will also have to have regard to other matters which may be prescribed in secondary legislation as well as any other which the commission thinks are important and relevant to its decisions.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09022317000094"></a>Clause 56 of this Bill amends Section 104(2) of the Planning Act 2008 to add the marine policy statement and relevant marine plans to the list of matters to which the infrastructure planning commission must have regard. This is at the heart of my concern on this matter. We have always been clear that we want a comprehensive and holistic marine policy statement and we are fully committed to ensuring that there is consistency between the marine policy statement&#151;</p>

Clearly, the test for any application that comes before the IPC is different from one that would have to come before the MMO. Therefore, there is not equality; there is not a level playing field. At the heart of our concerns is the fact that there will be an easier ride for an application to the IPC for development consent, while a similar application to the MMO will have to be dealt with in a different way. There will not be equality of treatment.</p>

<a name="09022317000096"></a><b><a name="90223-0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09022317000150"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I just do not see it that way. I was about to say that we are fully committed to ensuring that there is consistency between the marine policy statements and the national policy statements and that policies for the marine environment are included in the national policy statements where that is relevant. The same administration will be concerned with producing marine policy statements and national policy statements. There is absolutely no reason at all why there should be any inconsistency between what is in the national policy statement and what is in the marine policy statement.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09022320000001"></a>I turn to another point that is of concern to noble Lords. In a sense, there is a fear that somehow the MMO is being sidelined by the arrangements contained within the Planning Act. The IPC will license nationally significant projects, both on land and in the marine area. However, let us be clear that we expect it to handle around 45 applications each year, covering energy, transport and water and waste projects across both the onshore and offshore regions, while the MMO will be dealing with hundreds of other activities and developments taking place each year at sea, the cumulative impact of which are extremely significant. The MMO will also play a key role in advising the IPC on its decisions. We will take steps to ensure that the two bodies work well together.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09022320000002"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the threshold, which we also debated extensively during the passage of the Planning Bill. She will note that, being set at 100 megawatts, the threshold is in contrast to the 50 megawatts that applies on land, because renewable generating stations in the marine area are larger than those on land. It seems sensible that the threshold at which projects are treated differently, and become subject to the IPC regime, should be set  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>higher. For the near future, most wave and tidal developments will be smaller than 100 megawatts. Those smaller projects are unlikely to be subject to many of the challenges faced by their larger equivalents. So far, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and its predecessor have licensed 23 offshore renewable energy installations. If the MMO and IPC had been operational at the time, four wind farms and two wave and tidal installations&#151;at a combined generating capacity of 356 megawatts&#151;would have fallen to the MMO.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09022320000003"></a>Amendments 95 and 99 would amend the Planning Act in a slightly different way: first, by adding the MMO to those to be consulted before an applicant submits an application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission and including it in the local impact report procedures set out in the Planning Act; secondly, by giving the power to the MMO to decide whether national policy statements should have effect in the UK marine area; and, lastly, by requiring the Secretary of State to have regard to the MPS and any marine plans when preparing or amending national policy statements.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09022320000004"></a>I know that in our debates on the Planning Bill it was explained that certain persons who must be consulted on pre-application consultations will be prescribed in secondary legislation flowing from that Act. I am happy to reiterate to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, my intent to include the Marine Management Organisation within these regulations. That process has already begun with the publication late last month of the consultation on regulations under the Planning Act to make the Marine and Fisheries Agency, and subsequently the MMO, a consultee in relation to national policy statements. The consultation on the second package of regulations, which will deal with the pre-application consultation that is the subject of Amendment 95, will be published fairly shortly&#151;in the spring, I am told, although I am not entirely sure what a Defra or a DECC spring is. I can get some more information about that. On that basis, I hope that the noble Earl will agree that we do not need to amend the Planning Act to include this provision.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09022320000005"></a>I know that the noble Earl also wished to include the Marine Management Organisation in Section 60 of the Planning Act 2008, which makes provision regarding local impact reports. The amendments would require the IPC to give written notice to the Marine Management Organisation that it has accepted an application for a nationally significant infrastructure project that relates to coastal or offshore areas and to invite the MMO to submit a local impact report on that application. I ought to tell the Committee that we debated this issue during the passage of the Planning Bill. The provision for the Infrastructure Planning Commission to consider local impact reports is to give due prominence to democratically elected local councillors, who represent the views of local people affected by the proposal. For that reason, the MMO should not be treated in the same way; it is clearly a different type of organisation with a different remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09022320000006"></a>That does not mean to say that the MMO will not be involved&#151;far from it. We intend to prescribe the MMO as a statutory &#147;interested party&#148; under the  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_63"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>examination process that we will consult on later this year. As I have said, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will also draw on the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s expertise when assessing proposals for nationally significant infrastructure&#151;for instance, when it considers which conditions might be appropriate in order to mitigate any negative impacts on the marine environment. Details of how the Infrastructure Planning Commission will receive advice from the Marine Management Organisation will be covered in guidance under the Planning Act and through a memorandum of understanding.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09022320000007"></a>In addition, amendments made to the Planning Act by paragraph 3 of Schedule 8 to the Bill enable the Infrastructure Planning Commission to deem marine licences to have been issued as part of development consent under the Planning Act, if such a licence would be required for that project. Those marine licences will operate as if the Marine Management Organisation had issued them. Importantly, the MMO will then be responsible for monitoring and enforcing them; it could also add conditions to deemed licences as new information came to light.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09022320000008"></a>The first proposal in Amendment 99 would prevent a national policy statement from applying to the marine area unless it had been approved by the Marine Management Organisation. In relation to this amendment, the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, asked who would say no. Here, we come to an important point. I am strongly resistant to this amendment, because we have to be clear that the national policy statements will state government policy&#151;setting out the national need for infrastructure and providing a framework for decisions on nationally significant projects by the Infrastructure Planning Commission&#151;while the Marine Management Organisation will be a delivery body and a non-departmental public body.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09022320000009"></a>As we debated on the previous amendments, the MMO&#146;s role and expertise in marine matters will, of course, be hugely important. However, it will not set government policy for the marine area. The development of that policy, including the marine policy statement and the adoption of marine plans, is the responsibility of the policy authorities&#151;the marine plan authorities&#151;or, in other words, the Government, but not the Marine Management Organisation. For that reason, I strongly resist the idea that the MMO should be given the power of veto over decisions of Ministers to apply a national policy statement to the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09022320000010"></a>The second proposal in Amendment 99 relates to whether the Secretary of State should have regard to the marine policy statement and plans when developing national policy statements. I am glad that the Bill already imposes such a duty: Clause 56(3) requires that public authorities, including government departments and Ministers, have regard to marine policy statements and plans when taking any decisions that are,</p>
<ul><a name="09022320000042"></a>&#147;capable of affecting ... the UK marine area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022320000030"></a>That will include any decisions by Ministers to designate or amend a national policy statement that may apply to the marine area.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09022320000011"></a>Finally, I return to the fascinating question from the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart: who, in government, will say no? In essence, preparing the national policy  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statement and marine policy statement is a matter for the Government as a whole. It will be a corporate exercise, which is why it will be essential to have consistency between those statements. This will not work unless there is consistency. That is why I have confidence that the arrangements in the Bill and in the Planning Act will work and be consistent with government policy on planning and our intent with regard to the environment. I know that noble Lords feel strongly about this matter, but so do I. We need to be very cautious before we move away from the careful arrangements in the Planning Act and the Bill.</p>

I understand the Minister&#146;s argument but what I do not understand&#151;it may be me being naive&#151;is, if the Department of Energy and Climate Change is doing oil and gas installations at sea, the IPC is doing the over-100 megawatt installations and the MMO is granting other licences, who is saying, &#147;Hang on a minute. There&#146;s too much activity in that part of the sea. Stop! The cumulative effect is too much&#148;? The Secretaries of State in those three areas will not be saying that, but there is an EU directive that requires us to have this sort of break in place. That can only be the MMO, which would be looking at the overall effect of all these planning decisions at sea and would, therefore, presumably have to advise the Secretary of State at Defra that there is too much in an area, which is damaging the environment because the cumulative effect is too much. There must be a role for the scientists within the MMO to say that we must stop.</p>

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="09022320000013"></a><b><a name="90223-0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09022320000050"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> That is a fair question. We have already agreed that the MMO will have access to expert advice, whether on its own books or through&#151;but I do not want to go back to the debate that we had for what seemed an eternity. The MMO will have an extraordinary amount of expertise available to it and will be in a position to give advice to my department, Defra, and to other government departments. Since the MMO will be the licensing authority for the great majority of licensing divisions, acting within the marine plan and the marine policy statement, it will have a hugely influential role.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09022320000014"></a>The noble Earl asked what would happen if, in a few years&#146; time, a view is taken that activity in part of the marine area is doing damage. One would be extremely concerned, because Part 4, which we will come to shortly, lays down explicit circumstances in which the Marine Management Organisation will operate and in which licences will be granted. For example, Clause 66&#151;&#147;Determination of applications&#148;&#151;states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09022320000043"></a>&#147;the appropriate licensing authority must have regard to ... the need to protect the environment ... the need to protect human health ... the need to prevent interference with legitimate uses of the sea&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022320000031"></a>So one would be concerned if, notwithstanding the constraints and protections in the legislation, the cumulative impact of licensing decisions, most of which would have been made by the MMO, was causing the concern that the noble Earl suggests. In those circumstances, I would have thought that the MMO would advise relevant government departments.</p>

<a name="90223-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09022320000015"></a>I have already said that, in relation to the work of the IPC, the MMO will make advice available. There

If what had occurred suggested that the NPS and the marine policy statement needed adjustment, there are provisions in the Planning Act and the Bill for them to be made. I have no doubt that the advice of the MMO would be readily available to those organisations. However, that point does not detract from the overall architecture that we have put in place, which states that it is much better for one body to make consents that are deemed to be of national significance than for people to be confused about who should make them and for us to go back to pre-Planning Act problems in relation to planning.</p>

There was concern that these matters were not being dealt with in the same way. I have no more to add, except to say that it is crucial that this is got right. Although the smaller installations that might seek approval from the MMO would be greater in number, the bigger installations could clearly have greater impact on the marine environment. The committee considered this in great depth and my noble friend has a valid point. The difficulty is that the MMO has certain responsibilities, yet the Secretary of State or Minister in whichever devolved Administration will have the overall responsibility. Those things do not sit very happily together. There was considerable discussion in the committee and unease that the two are being dealt with differently. I did not have the advantage of sitting on the planning committee, so I cannot comment on what went on in it. However, the Minister should not be unaware of the degree of concern on this issue.</p>

If one were to cut the cards in a different way, there would still be inconsistencies, because if we were to accept the thrust of the amendments, we would be taking the marine area out of the planning regime that we have just enacted. There are a number of ways in which one can approach this, but we get consistency through the national policy statement and the marine policy statement being entirely consistent. We think that the best way to get consistency is by the MMO being in a strong position to give advice to the IPC about the decisions that it is called on to make.</p>

My perception of the two statements is that they can probably coexist at quite a high level of generality; the nub of the question comes when you start to make individual planning decisions. It is quite conceivable that you could have two policy statements that seemed compatible whereas at the same time there was a requirement, as the result of an individual planning application, to decide whether the economic significance, climate-change significance, or whatever other significance of an offshore energy proposition, for example&#151;and offshore energy is not the only issue, there are many other issues to do with marine resources in general&#151;was more important than the impact on the marine environment which the MMO and the marine policy statement are aimed at protecting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09022320000019"></a>A distinction need to be made between the measures which the Minister has put forward to get compatibility between these two policy statements and clarification of who can call the shots in each individual application. You could do it either way. We could say that the Infrastructure Planning Commission should be the power on land and at sea for the issues that it covers. Personally, having argued for the creation of marine policy and the MMO because successive planning decisions and successive resource-extraction decisions in the marine environment had over time depleted its value, I think that we were at risk of dribbling away one of our most precious resources as an island through a series of individual planning decisions. Giving the Infrastructure Planning Commission predominance in these decisions would continue to do that on a piecemeal basis. Unless we grip the issue and say that the marine policy statement and the decisions of the MMO at least have parity in terms of the importance of the marine policy statement&#151;and preferably the MMO is the boss in the marine setting&#151;we are missing yet again the benefit that this Bill should be bringing to the marine environment.</p>

I understand what the noble Baroness is saying, but I hope that the MPS and the NPS are not going to be woolly and vague statements. I fully expect them to be very clear statements, and I expect the IPC to come to a view that will be consistent with both. Equally, I would not ignore the benefit of the IPC calling on the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s expertise when assessing proposals because I am sure that it will have an important contribution to make. Moving away from the clearly stated framework that we set in statute only four months ago would cause a great deal of concern. Any uncertainty about which body was taking the decision would be the worst of all worlds and very confusing indeed.</p>

If there were parallel approaches rather than slightly different ones, the IPC would have to take a decision in accordance with, rather than having regard to, the marine policy statements, or the Marine Management Organisation would have to have regard to the national policy statements, which is a lesser test than taking decisions in accordance with them,</p>
<ul><a name="09022320000044"></a>&#147;unless relevant considerations indicate otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022320000032"></a>That was a phrase that we debated on the last occasion. If I understand this correctly, it is not necessarily the Marine Management Organisation that will be taking the decision. The noble Lord made much of the IPC&#151;the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which was quite often referred to as the independent planning commission in the debates on the Planning Act. It is intended to be independent in its approach, though of course it will be dealing with policy statements which come from the Government of the day or which a Government have inherited from their predecessor. The noble Lord is quite right in that. But the public authority taking a decision under Clause 56 will not necessarily be of the same political hue as the Government whose policies

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="09022320000039"></a>&#147;A person aggrieved by a relevant document may make an application to the appropriate court on any of the following grounds&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="09022320000040"></a>(a) that the document is not within the appropriate powers;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09022320000041"></a>(b) that a procedural requirement has not been complied with&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022320000033"></a>My Amendment 96 seeks to add another ground:</p>
<ul><a name="09022320000045"></a>&#147;that the provisions are not in accordance with any international agreement to which the United Kingdom or the European Union is for the time being a party&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022320000034"></a>The reason for this is that the provisions in a marine policy statement or marine plan should not be in conflict with the UK&#146;s treaty law obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, covering, for example, rights of innocent passage and freedom of navigation, or other conventions, such as MARPOL, dealing with marine pollution. Issues of conflict are matters of substance and should give rise to an automatic right of referral to, and determination by, the courts. This amendment would provide such a course of action.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09022320000025"></a>Amendment 97 refers to subsection (5), which says:</p>
<ul><a name="09022320000046"></a>&#147;Any such application must be made not later than 6 weeks after the publication of the relevant document&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022320000035"></a>My amendment seeks to lengthen that period to no later than 12 weeks, as the issues for a referral to a court are likely to be complex, especially where matters of international treaty law need to be considered. A period of six weeks would be insufficient; 12 weeks is much more realistic.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09022320000026"></a>Amendment 98 seeks to add a small new subsection to Clause 60, which deals with the powers of a court over an application under Section 59. My amendment would insert a new paragraph (c) into subsection (3), using the same wording as my Amendment 96, which would require a court to use its powers under subsection (4) to quash or remit a proposal when satisfied that there has been a breach of treaty law obligations. I beg to move.</p>

It is important that it is made absolutely clear that it is an offence if international agreements are not complied with, and that this should mean referral to the courts. Will the Minister tell us whether this is the case?</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09022320000028"></a>We have already spoken in our debate on Amendment 73 about the importance of guidance on the implementation of, or compliance with, obligations of the UK under EU treaties and international agreements. We agreed, I think, that it was crucial both for the UK to abide by new and old agreements and for other countries to do the same with regard to us. We cannot operate in a vacuum, and the success of the Bill will depend in large part on how well international agreements are adhered to both by us and by them. I therefore agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, that it is of the utmost importance that we clarify whether non-compliance with international obligations means referral to the courts. Will the Minister clarify the position? Does he agree that it would be helpful to put this into the Bill?</p>

When dealing with the complex issues to which the noble Lord referred and which the Bill is likely to raise, six weeks is a very short time.

The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has asked me a couple of quite specific questions, which I hope I will cover in my response to the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09022329000002"></a>Amendments 96 and 98, which the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, has proposed, seek to create a new ground on which legal challenges may be brought against marine policy statements or plans; that is, if the MPS or the plans are not in accordance with EU or international obligations. I fully understand the noble Lord&#146;s concern that international shipping treaty obligations might be breached. That is a pretty important matter. If the challenge were successful, the court would be able to quash the document or send it back to an earlier stage in the preparation process.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09022329000003"></a>The provisions in Clauses 59 and 60 enable anyone who is aggrieved by an MPS or a plan to challenge it if the plan authority failed to comply with the process set out for the document&#146;s preparation, including any procedural requirements contained in a direction delegating the planning functions to another body, or if the plan authority or delegate acted outside their legal powers in preparing the document. This is the same approach that is used in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Those legal powers to prepare the MPS or the plan must be read in accordance with any limitations imposed by the UK&#146;s existing European Union and international obligations. I assure the Committee, particularly the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who emphasised this point, that if the marine plan or the MPS is not in accordance with our EU or international obligations, it has not been prepared within the appropriate powers and may therefore be challenged in the courts. I will ask the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, to withdraw his amendment, because in effect it reaffirms the legal position as it stands and is therefore not required.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09022329000004"></a>Amendment 97 seeks to extend the time window during which legal challenges may be brought against an adopted marine policy statement or plan from six to 12 weeks. This very same issue was discussed in our debate on challenges to national policy statements under the Planning Act 2008, to which the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, recently referred. The Committee will be familiar with the points that I am about to make. Even if we left aside the Planning Act, which contains this, this is not a new provision. A six-week period for commencing proceedings applies at present to statutory challenges to the development plan under the Town and Country Planning Act, which received Royal Assent in 1990, and the same approach was used again in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09022329000005"></a>The regime that we have set out in the Bill has been designed to provide a fair system that encourages engagement and participation in the process of preparing marine policy documents rather than a reliance on legal challenge after those documents are adopted. We want to avoid the delays that are inevitably caused by such challenges, and the attendant uncertainty and doubt that they cause in the minds of decision-makers and developers. We have prescribed processes for preparing marine policy documents that are clear and open and are undertaken in full public view. The preparation process begins with the publication of a statement of public participation, and sets out how the policy or plan authority intends to involve those who are interested in, or affected by, the document. That statement will be a living document, which is to be kept under review and updated throughout the process.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09022329000006"></a>When the final marine policy statement or plan is adopted and published, it will make clear the date on which it comes into effect. We will ensure that we publish it in ways that are considered to be the most likely to bring it to the attention of anyone who is interested in or likely to be affected by it. We want to ensure that anyone who wants to participate has the opportunity to do so. As I said in our debate on the previous amendment, this is the time for concerns and issues to be raised: when the authority can do something about them. By the time the documents are adopted and published, any concerns should not be new issues. That is why it is reasonable to ask for challenges to be brought within six weeks of the adoption and publication of the document.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09022329000007"></a>The Government are strongly of the view that the six-week period is reasonable in the context of the way in which the marine planning and policy statements are developed. That is why we have tabled Amendment 97ZA, which is grouped with these amendments. We want the six-week rule to be applied consistently across the UK. This would therefore also include any challenge which was brought before the Court of Session in Scotland, which is a change in the Bill as currently drafted. This is a minor and technical amendment which is necessitated by an earlier misunderstanding on our part that their judicial review process requires this. The Scottish Executive have since clarified that this is not the case and stated that they agree that the six-week deadline for applications to challenge the validity of a marine policy statement and marine plan documents should also apply in Scotland. They are at one with us on the six-week period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09022329000008"></a>In the light of this change and the explanations that I have put forward, I hope the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, will feel that we have taken into account the very important representation he has made and feel able to withdraw the amendment. I also hope that the Committee will feel able in due course to support the government technical amendment.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09022329000011"></a>Clause 63 lists the activities that will require a marine licence. The Bill also provides more effective enforcement of marine licensing legislation. In preparing the Bill we have already made a number of responses in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny. In replying to a number of the responses we received to the consultation we have tabled government amendments to amend the test of the severity of harm or interference for the issue of remediation notices from &#147;serious harm&#148; or &#147;serious interference&#148; to simply &#147;harm&#148; or &#147;interference&#148;. We believe that harm caused by the commission of an offence should not have to be serious before the person who caused the harm should have to make amends. That is consistent with the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09022329000012"></a>We have included Clause 70 in response to recommendation 20 of the Joint Committee&#146;s report which recommends a clear mechanism for appealing licensing decisions of the appropriate licensing authority. We have agreed with Delegated Powers Committee&#146;s recommendations and introduced government amendments, or added my name to opposition amendments, to change some of the procedures for orders made under this part of the Bill from the negative procedure to the affirmative one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09022329000013"></a>Part 4 is technical and complex and this group of amendments&#151;as with group 20, which I hope we will debate later&#151;includes a number of government amendments. The amendments in group 20 relate to the new enforcement tools being set up in this part. My minor and technical amendments were identified after a careful run-through of the complex Part 4 provisions to ensure that they work and are legally sound. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="09022329000165"></a>&#147;in items 11, 12 and 13 &#145;incinerate&#146; and &#145;incineration&#146; shall not include activities relating to the navigation, management or operation of a vessel&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000128"></a>Shipboard incineration activities connected with the running or onboard operations of a vessel are already regulated under international agreement through MARPOL, which lays down rules covering when, in which areas and under what conditions shipboard waste may be incinerated. The amendment ensures that such operations are not brought within the scope of licensable activities under the Bill. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is so.</p>

Let me be clear that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to license those incineration activities that are part of the everyday running and operation of a vessel. Current legislation exempts the incineration of victual or domestic waste originating on vessels and we are not changing that. However, we do not think that a carte blanche exemption in the Bill is the way to do it.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09022329000016"></a>Incineration is subject to a number of international and European rules. The London Protocol and OSPAR generally prohibit incineration but have exceptions for the normal operation of vessels. However, that is not the full picture. Article 16 of MARPOL provides a number of restrictions on the onboard incineration of waste and matter generated during the normal operation of a ship. Waste-management licensing regulations also provide additional conditions on the incineration of waste on board vessels.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09022329000017"></a>It is our intention to use the exemptions order provided by Clause 71 to exempt incineration activities that are part of the everyday running and operation of a vessel in a manner which is compatible with the myriad rules and legislation applied to it. That is the approach used in FEPA, and a quick look at the FEPA exemptions order will show that quite a complex clause would be

Moreover, such an approach might be compatible with the current international rules and obligations but fall foul of this legislation in future if new rules come into force or existing rules are amended.</p>

<a name="90223-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09022329000018"></a>We will cover exemptions in more detail when we come to a later group of amendments. However, as a further reassurance to the Committee, we will consult extensively with industry and other parties when putting together the exemptions order to ensure that we capture all those activities with minimal or no impact in order to get the sensible, fair and proportionate approach to regulation that we seek to achieve. I hope the noble Lord will be satisfied with the reassurance that we intend to deal as I suggested with the exemptions order provided in Clause 71. I therefore hope he will consider not pressing his amendment.</p>

The draft Criminal Defence  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Service (Information Requests) Regulations will support the application process for criminal legal aid in the magistrates&#146; courts so that information provided by a defendant about their financial status can be properly verified. This follows implementation of Section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which inserted paragraphs 6 to 8 into Schedule 3 to the Access to Justice Act 1999. In practice, this means that the Legal Services Commission, as the authority responsible for granting publicly funded representation in criminal cases, may request specific information from the Department for Work and Pensions or Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09022329000021"></a>The Government have long considered that those defendants, in criminal cases, who can afford to pay for their defence in the magistrates&#146; courts, should be asked to do so. This was the principle that underpinned the Government&#146;s decision to introduce means-testing in magistrates&#146; courts in October 2006. I should explain that certain categories of applicant are automatically passported through the financial eligibility test. These are all defendants under 18 years of age and all defendants in receipt of one of the four passporting benefits, namely income support, income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, the guarantee state pension credit and income-related employment and support allowance.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09022329000022"></a>While the means-testing scheme is now working well in magistrates&#146; courts, we are continually looking at ways of improving it&#151;such as the new arrangements covered by this statutory instrument. To date, there has been a formal agreement between DWP and Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service which allows HMCS to confirm, through an IT link that provides an immediate yes/no answer, whether an applicant was in receipt of a benefit which rendered them eligible for legal aid. There has also been an informal agreement which allows confirmation of other forms of benefit income with DWP and other forms of income with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. The amendments to the Access to Justice Act 1999, and this instrument, are putting these working practices on a much clearer statutory footing.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09022329000023"></a>While such checks have been undertaken on the basis of written consent provided by the applicant on their legal aid form, the Government believe that these working practices need to be established on a firmer basis. The new arrangements will provide a more detailed picture of the welfare benefits that the applicant may be receiving, which will allow for a more accurate and speedy verification of their financial status. This supports initiatives such as <I>Criminal Justice: Simple, Speedy, Summary</I> which has successfully delivered a more effective and responsive justice system for victims and the public.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09022329000024"></a>It is not always the case that each and every application will undergo verification. For example, there can be circumstances, such as when a defendant is remanded in custody, that applications may be accepted on the basis of self-certification of income. In these cases, the LSC has, in agreement with the National Audit Office, adopted a system of proportionate post-event checks to ensure that any risk to public funds is kept within an acceptable level.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_75"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90223-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09022329000025"></a>One specific category of applicant where this would prove of assistance is those individuals who declare zero income on their application form. Although the LSC would not be able to demonstrate conclusively that an applicant has no benefit, appropriate checks with DWP would confirm whether a defendant is receiving any benefits, while checks with HMRC would confirm whether they have any legitimate income. This will prove invaluable in combating potential fraud.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09022329000026"></a>The amendment to primary legislation, supported by the new statutory instrument, will put these arrangements on a much more formal footing and also allow for the necessary robustness and scrutiny. A second related statutory instrument, the Criminal Defence Service (Information Requests) (Prescribed Benefits) Regulations 2009, was laid on 9 February. This details the list of benefits to be considered when assessing an individual&#146;s benefit status.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09022329000027"></a>While the amendments to Schedule 3 to the Access to Justice Act 1999 table some of the information which may be the subject of a request, such as name, address and national insurance number, regulations can specify further information which may be sought. The statutory instrument before the House specifies that information may be requested about an individual&#146;s income, capital gains and benefits administered by HMRC. It also includes information about the applicant&#146;s status as a company director or partner in a business.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09022329000028"></a>Schedule 3 to the Access to Justice Act also allows information to be requested about any benefits which the applicant is receiving from the DWP. The statutory instrument before the House also extends this to benefits received over the two-year period which precedes the legal aid application.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09022329000029"></a>I stress that the new arrangements will not make any substantial difference to defendants or solicitors or courts in terms of forms or process. There is therefore no risk of any delay to existing court proceedings or any additional burden on defendants or solicitors. Both this instrument and the other negative instrument were the subject of a 12-week-long consultation exercise last autumn. We received three responses and all were broadly supportive of the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09022329000030"></a>Regarding data protection, nothing within the new legislative framework dilutes the Government&#146;s obligation to protect an individual&#146;s personal information and to maintain confidentiality. Indeed, the primary legislation expressly forbids any disclosure of information which contravenes the Data Protection Act 1998. It also specifically makes it a criminal offence to disclose the information for any purpose other than that related to the administration and operation of the means test.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09022329000031"></a>Following the publication of Sir Gus O&#146;Donnell&#146;s data handling report on 25 June 2008, I can further confirm that officials in my department are undertaking a privacy impact assessment in relation to the data-sharing arrangements and their impact upon privacy. This will be taken forward in liaison with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office with the final document being published on the Ministry of Justice website. We are confident that the proposed arrangements for requesting information set out in this instrument are  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_76"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both necessary and proportionate, and that proper measures are in place to afford sufficient protection to applicants.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09022329000032"></a>These new arrangements, supported by the new instrument, support an effective criminal justice system. They will ensure greater accuracy in the information provided by defendants in magistrates&#146; courts as well as delivering greater accountability for the taxpayer. This strikes a right and fair balance, and I commend the instrument to the House.</p>

Ostensibly, the regulations are not controversial, but what is the need for them? The Minister needs to give us further explanation. The Government need to explain why they need the power to allow yet more information to be exchanged between government departments. As I understand it, the Legal Services Commission, which administers legal aid applications, will ask the applicant, when they put in their application, whether they are prepared to allow the department or the Legal Services Commission to go to the DWP to find out whether they are in receipt of the appropriate benefits. Can the Government show whether there has been any abuse of this? The noble Lord explained&#151;as did his honourable friend in another place&#151;that not every application undergoes verification. He then explained that, to avoid delays, verification sometimes took place after the occasion, in which case the individual was asked whether they had been in receipt of benefits. Presumably, if the individual had initially given a dishonest answer, it might be that he was not prepared to give his consent; I do not know if that is the case. However, presumably if he felt that he was &#147;clean&#148;, to use that expression, he would have said, &#147;Yes, go ahead and check&#148;. I do not know whether the Government know that there is any abuse in this area.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09022329000034"></a>The Government have also said that they want to reduce delays, and that that was one of the reasons why in the past they asked only a certain number of people afterwards whether there had been abuse. In this new system, even with the checks being brought in&#151;the Minister has made it clear that they are not going to ask everyone because some people would automatically be accepted as being in receipt of the appropriate benefits&#151;there may be a danger of even longer delays because more people will have to be asked whether these applications were made. I would be grateful if the noble Lord could address those points.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09022329000035"></a>I turn now to a point raised by my honourable friend Mr Philip Davies in another place when he sought assurances from the Government about leaks occurring when private information is exchanged between two government departments. We were told firmly that the Government are undertaking what was referred to as a &#147;private impact assessment&#148; of the data-sharing arrangements. What more can the Minister say about the review into what has been going on, and has any damage been caused to data protection? I welcome the Minister&#146;s remarks on data protection in his opening  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_77"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>speech; he certainly went further than his colleague in another place. But we would all be grateful if he could add just a little more when he responds to the debate.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09022329000036"></a>Having said that ostensibly the regulations are not controversial, I had better repeat that I still have some doubts as to whether there is any particular need for them because the system seems to be working tolerably well at the moment. Again, however, I hope that the Minister will address that when he comes to respond.</p>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="09022329000037"></a><b><a name="90223-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022329000261"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, in June 2007 the Solicitor-General, Miss Vera Baird, addressed an international legal aid conference in Antwerp, shortly after the new scheme introduced by the Criminal Defence Service Act came into force. At the time she said that the rollout of this new financial means testing scheme in the magistrates&#146; courts would deliver annual savings of more than &#8364;50 million, which in those days was around &#163;30 million, but today is &#163;50 million, due no doubt to the way this Government have conducted their finances. I should be interested to know whether her forecast of a &#8364;50 million saving has been fulfilled. It may well have been, because in an article published in the <I>Observer</I> on 1 February, just a few weeks ago, the Legal Aid Practitioners Group said that it estimated that more than half of the 11,000 lawyers&#146; offices willing to take on legal aid work less than a decade ago have either closed down or moved out of the field, leaving a shortage of help available for vulnerable people on modest incomes. Carol Storer, a director of the group, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="09022329000149"></a>&#147;We are hearing about firms struggling to keep legal aid work going; thousands have stopped their legal aid work altogether. It&#146;s is a massive reduction. It is not just the money&#151;although it is extremely hard to make a living out of this type of work now&#151;but also the bureaucracy involved. The paperwork is overwhelming, and that is a complaint we are hearing all the time. Some firms are just gradually whittling down the numbers of legal aid cases they&#146;ll take on&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000129"></a>I suppose that I had better declare an interest as a practitioner who does legal aid work in the criminal courts, although not in the magistrates&#146; courts. I can confirm from my own experience that firms are indeed cutting back on legal aid work because it is no longer profitable.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09022329000038"></a>The statutory instrument before noble Lords today has nothing to do with the actual quantum of legal aid. We understand that that has been fixed, and any efforts to raise the ceiling are sternly resisted by the Government in whichever field they arise. This instrument is about the sharing of information and is very much a data protection issue. What is the need for it? Why should one government department be able to go to a whole series of other government departments to find out information about an individual? Why is this needed? It is not going to cost any less to do that than the cost of the current system. In the debate on 11 February to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks, Mr Shahid Malik said that this new system will cost &#163;140,000 or so more. It is a more expensive way of calculating the appropriate level at which legal aid will be granted.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09022329000039"></a>Will time be saved and delays reduced by doing this? No evidence has been produced to suggest that that is the case. No estimate is made in the impact  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statement, but perhaps the Minister would like to tell us whether any time will be saved, or will the magistrates&#146; courts become even more clogged up with applications because they have to means-test and seek information about every single applicant&#151;not, as is the case at the moment, on simply a selection of applicants who voluntarily agree to have their affairs investigated. Is there fraud in the current system? Nothing has been demonstrated by the Government to show that legal aid applicants in criminal cases are fraudulent when they make their applications. How many cases have been brought against applicants for legal aid since October 2006 where it was alleged that they had misrepresented their means in one way or the other?</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09022329000040"></a>These regulations appear to be what the Government call the &#147;transformation&#148; approach&#151;that is the word used in the impact assessment. It talks about transformational government, which enables one department of government to know everything about an individual if he makes an application. We on these Benches are opposed in principle to that approach. It is wrong in principle that any department of government&#151;we do not know at what level the assessment will be made&#151;should be able to gain information just at the drop of a hat. The data sharing culture that is now a part of transformational government is a threat to privacy. It is a threat to the whole concept of data protection. It implies that the Government&#146;s goal is to treat citizens as one individual file with a coherent single relationship with a centralised state, and that the Government should have the right to share that individual&#146;s data among all their organs. We on these Benches are opposed to the principle behind this statutory instrument, which does precisely that. I should like some assurances from the Minister that the protections of the Data Protection Act will be retained, that the necessary consents to the particular information-sharing order will be obtained, and that the whole process should be within the purview of the information commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09022329000041"></a>What appears on the face of it to be a pretty anodyne statutory instrument in effect breaches a number of principles. First, it confirms how legal aid is now being denied to a considerable section of the public because of the means testing and the limits placed upon it. Secondly, it pursues the Government&#146;s transformational processes by making information about the individual available to every single department that has anything to do with that individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09022329000042"></a>We do not propose to vote against this statutory instrument tonight, and we cannot amend it. However, we remain opposed to it in principle.</p>

I will first try to explain the need for the power to exchange more information in this way. It allows for a more detailed verification of an applicant&#146;s financial status, which in itself can help to tackle fraud. We are talking about a defendant in a case who is seeking taxpayers&#146; money&#151;legal aid&#151;which is a limited resource. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, talks about it as though it has not increased hugely in the course of the past 25 years and the past 10 years. In England and Wales  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_79"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we spend about &#163;2 billion per year on legal aid, &#163;1.2 billion of which goes towards the criminal courts and the balance towards both family and civil courts. Many of us think that that is a serious imbalance, particularly against civil legal aid and those at the bottom of the pile who need more help than they get.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09022329000044"></a>The argument is that, in criminal cases, the amount of legal aid spent is very large indeed. It is true that the legal aid budget is not going up at the moment, nor is it likely to in the foreseeable future. That would currently be the case under any Government that was in charge. However, it is a generous system compared to that of any other country in the world. I want to be careful about comparisons, because not all systems of law are the same as that which we conduct here.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09022329000045"></a>The reason for this statutory instrument is that it allows for more detailed verification. There will be no delay&#151;less delay, if anything&#151;as a consequence. Although the previous system did not work badly, there was a feeling among government departments that it was better to put this system on a clearer and more systematic basis, so it was decided to go this way.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09022329000046"></a>To answer the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, on savings made by the means-testing scheme in the magistrate&#146;s courts, its reintroduction has delivered in excess of &#163;65 million in net savings between October 1 2006 and the end of August 2008. This has enabled the Government to maintain their commitment to make some effort to rebalance legal aid funding in favour of the civil scheme. I hope that that will find general support in this House and elsewhere.</p>

Indeed, the money that this new scheme has cost, referred to by the noble Lord, comes not from the legal aid fund that the LSC is responsible for but from its own administrative fund. That is of course a separate amount of money, which, in the final analysis, comes from the Exchequer. Those costs will obviously go to pay Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service staff who do some of this work on behalf of the LSC, and to the other two departments of state for their work.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09022329000049"></a>Questions have been asked about data protection. We understand and respect that the House as a whole is concerned about this. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked me about a privacy impact assessment, which I will describe a bit better. It is a process during which the potential privacy issues and risks of a proposal are identified and examined from the perspectives of all those involved&#151;in other words, users and service providers&#151;and consideration given to how to avoid or minimise privacy concerns. These assessments should be carried out on all policies that involve the processing of personal data.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09022329000050"></a>Government departments are required to undertake privacy impact assessments because the data sharing review, published in July last year, noted their benefits, stating:</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_80"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="09022329000150"></a>&#147;Privacy impact assessments are structured assessments of a project&#146;s potential impact on privacy, carried out at any early stage. They enable organisations to anticipate and address the likely impacts of new initiatives, foresee problems and negotiate solutions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000130"></a>In addition, the data handling review mandated that all departments will introduce privacy impact assessments which ensure that privacy issues are factored into plans from the start.</p>

<a name="90223-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09022329000051"></a>Of course, this is personal information given by one government department to another for a purpose. However, we are satisfied that that information is secure, and is unable to get out into the hands of those who have absolutely no need to have it. I hope that, with those few words, I have to some extent comforted both noble Lords about these provisions.</p>

The potential for fraud was undoubtedly somewhat greater under the old system than the new. Of course, there will always be attempts at fraud in this field. However, I tell the noble Lord frankly that there has not been a huge amount of fraud that I could point to under the old system, and I certainly do not anticipate much under this revised system. I have done my best to answer the questions that have been asked.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_81"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90223-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09022329000055"></a>&#147;Expedient&#148; has two different meanings. One is fairly benign&#151;in that circumstance perhaps there is a case for including it here&#151;the other is loaded with a deprecatory meaning. I want to examine that briefly with the benefit of my noble friend&#146;s research. The <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> defines &#147;expedient&#148; as,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000166"></a>&#147;conducive to advantage in general or to a definite purpose; fit, proper or suitable to the circumstances of the case&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000131"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000167"></a>&#147;in depreciative sense, &#145;useful&#146; or &#145;politic&#146; as opposed to &#145;just&#146; or &#145;right&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000132"></a>I am sure that the Committee is in favour of things that are just and right but is it also in favour of things that are merely useful and politic? That is only one definition. The first definition in the <I>Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> 1991 is,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000168"></a>&#147;advantageous, advisable on practical rather than moral grounds&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000133"></a>At this time of night, I hope that we do not need to explore whether we want to have something that will be immoral; surely we are not in that business. The second definition is, &#147;suitable, appropriate&#148;.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09022329000056"></a><I>Collins Cobuild Essential English Dictionary</I> 1998 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09022329000152"></a>&#147;An expedient is an action or a plan that achieves a particular purpose, but that may not be morally acceptable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000134"></a>The Committee is not full to the rafters with Members, but if it was I am sure they would not be terribly keen on something that was not morally acceptable. My noble friend discovered a further definition in Merriam-Webster&#146;s Online Dictionary. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="09022329000153"></a>&#147;Expedient usually implies what is immediately advantageous without regard for ethics or consistent principles&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000135"></a>I await with bated breath to hear what the Minister will say to justify something that has no regard for ethics or consistent principles.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09022329000057"></a>Finally, no Liberal or Liberal Democrat can go into the business of definition without quoting John Stuart Mill. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09022329000154"></a>&#147;The expedient, in the sense in which it is opposed to the right, generally means that which is expedient for the particular interest of the state itself&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000136"></a>This is a very small amendment based on the concept that &#147;necessary&#148; is quite enough; nothing else is necessary and it simply is not expedient. I speak also to Amendment No. 101ZB, which seeks to leave out &#147;or expedient&#148; at line 40 of page 36. I submit that &#147;necessary&#148; is quite sufficient, and that nothing else is expedient. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09022329000059"></a>I shall try to set the noble Lord&#146;s mind to rest on the matter. Clause 64(4) allows the licensing authority to require the applicant to provide further information or articles or to permit investigations, examinations and tests that it considers,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000169"></a>&#147;necessary or expedient to enable it to determine the application&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_82"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09022329000137"></a>Subsection (5) allows the licensing authority to charge the applicant a reasonable fee to carry out those investigations, examinations and tests.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09022329000060"></a>I understand the point behind the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. We want the licensing authority to make its decisions as expediently as possible based on the best available information. Clearly, determining licences involves the exercise of judgment. The more information that the licensing authority has about any proposed development the better informed its decision can be. Making a determination is not just making a yes or no decision on whether to grant a licence. It is about attaching the right conditions that will best mitigate the adverse impact of any development or activity. Carrying out tests and investigations is an efficient way of allowing the licensing authority to use its judgment, which will be based on experience and expertise of marine matters. It will gather information that it considers useful in making a well informed and reasonable decision.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09022329000061"></a>An example of a common type of test conducted is one that requires an applicant to provide sediment samples for chemical or particle size analysis in order to identify if it contains unacceptably high levels of organic or inorganic contaminants and how or if the material can be predicted to disperse from a disposal site. In some cases it will be obvious that information is necessary before the licensing authority can be confident of being able to make any sort of determination. An obvious example would be information pertaining to the location of the activity. However, in many cases it will not be so clear cut. Some tests and investigations will be open to challenge on whether they were absolutely necessary for a determination to be made, but which would undoubtedly contribute to a more effective and better determination. Also when a test has been carried out that has confirmed that there is no adverse environmental risk, or even perhaps has failed to produce any meaningful results, a case might be advanced that the investigation was not shown to be necessary.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09022329000062"></a>We are conscious not to overburden industry with a requirement to conduct test after test where the impacts of an activity are likely to be negligible. However, we think this matter is more appropriately addressed operationally as part of ensuring that licensing authorities make effective and sensible decisions based on the particular facts of the case in question. We do not want to hamstring in any way the ability of the licensing authority to be able to make the most effective decisions that it can. We feel that removing the word &#147;expedient&#148; from the legislation would do this. I was interested in the tour de force dictionary definitions of &#147;expedient&#148;. Would it be helpful if I gave the Government&#146;s view of the meaning of the word? It is the first definition given by the noble Lord that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000170"></a>&#147;conducive to advantage in general or to a definite purpose; fit, proper or suitable to the circumstances of the case&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000138"></a>which I find entirely satisfactory and useful. The noble Lord then asked what precedents there were for using the word &#147;expedient&#148;. I am glad to say that we have found two. One is from Section 112A(4) of the Energy Act 2004:</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000155"></a>&#147;if a notice under subsection (1) requires information in connection with a function of the Secretary of State under Section 107(1) or (4), the notice may require the provision of information or

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09022329000063"></a>Section 43 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, under &#147;Possession of pesticides harmful to wildlife&#148;, has two parts. The second part says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="09022329000156"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may not make an order under subsection (1) unless he is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of protecting wild birds or wild animals from harm&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000064"></a>In essence, there is a precedent and it is sensible and proportionate to allow us to have &#147;expedient&#148; in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="09022329000065"></a><b><a name="90223-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022329000270"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I do not know how the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would respond to that, but I think that he would express gratitude to the Minister for establishing the precedents&#151;this House likes its precedents. I still think that &#147;expedient&#148; in all other definitions, which have not been quoted by the Minister but which my noble friend referred to, has a deprecatory sense; that is even in the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>. &#147;Necessary&#148;, &#147;desirable&#148; or &#147;appropriate&#148; might be more suitable here. The noble Lord is clearly trying to make this legally watertight&#151;to coin a phrase&#151;so that it will not be challenged. So be it; that is right. I suspect that &#147;expedient&#148; is just as likely to be challenged by some clever lawyer as the other words that we have referred to as possible alternatives. Nevertheless, this is, I am sure, not an issue on which we want to spend any more time. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I hope that I manage to pick up all the amendments; again, there are amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves. Amendment 101ZC to  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_84"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clause 65, which is about publishing notification of applications, requires the MMO to notify the principal local authorities and the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities of applications for licences in their areas. Those who are familiar with my noble friend&#146;s amendments will not be surprised to see a provision for involving local authorities, and quite rightly so.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09022329000067"></a>Councils, in my noble friend&#146;s view and mine, should have a statutory right to information about applications being made. The Bill at present says that the licensing authority must publish notice of the application or require the applicant to do so,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000171"></a>&#147;in such manner as the authority thinks is best calculated to bring the application to the attention of any persons likely to be interested in it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000068"></a>No doubt local authorities and IFCs would fall within this on any common-sense point of view, but they are important statutory bodies and should not fall foul of the Government&#146;s resistance to including statutory consultees and so on.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09022329000069"></a>In these days of electronic communications, it is very easy to send out e-mail lists&#151;I am sure that noble Lords get far more notifications of all sorts of things by e-mail than they really want&#151;and that would be a useful and easy thing to do. Indeed, local authorities often send out lists of planning applications in this way.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09022329000070"></a>Amendment 101BZBC is a similar amendment to require these bodies to be consulted on applications as part of the process under Clause 66. It is about a right of consultation, not just notification, so it is stronger than the previous amendment, but the underlying philosophy&#151;the importance of these bodies&#151;is the same.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09022329000071"></a>Amendment 101BZBD is also about the consultation process. Clause 66(6) provides:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="09022329000160"></a>&#147;A licensing authority may by regulations make further provision as to the procedure to be followed in connection with&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09022329000139"></a>various things. The amendment would add &#147;the consultation process&#148;. This really amounts to the licensing authority publishing the system of consultation that it will follow, because clearly those who learn of an application, by whatever means, need to know that they can make representations, how they can make representations and so on.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09022329000072"></a>Amendment 101BZZB is also an amendment to Clause 66, which lists the things that the licensing authority must have regard to&#151;I think that the Minister has referred to this list already today&#151;including the environment, human health, preventing interference with legitimate uses of the sea and,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000172"></a>&#147;such other matters as the authority thinks relevant&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000140"></a>The amendment to delete those words is a probing amendment, and I invite the Government to give some examples of what they think the authority might think relevant in this context.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09022329000073"></a>Clause 66(3) provides that the licensing authority,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000173"></a>&#147;must have regard to any representations which it receives from any person having an interest in the outcome of the application&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000141"></a>Those words after &#147;person&#148; would be deleted by Amendment 101BZAB. Again, the amendment is probing. What is meant by &#147;an interest&#148; in this context? Mostly, in documents that have a legal effect, &#147;interest&#148; is  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_85"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understood to mean a financial interest, ownership, or an interest that might be affected by an application. However, does it mean having an interest in the sense of, &#147;This is something that we are concerned about&#148;? In other words, is it wider? If it is the latter, surely the point could be met by the deletion of the words. I suspect that it is the former, though I hope that the licensing authority will have regard to applications wherever they come from.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09022329000074"></a>We have many examples of applications for development where I would certainly say that those who have a concern about a projected development have a right to be heard&#151;I use that in the widest sense&#151;as well as those who have a legal interest in the subject matter. I suppose that the terrestrial example in my mind is Heathrow Airport, although the Minister would counter this by saying that it should be a matter of policy. A lot of people have an interest in the land that would be the subject of development at Heathrow, but many others have a concern about it.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09022329000075"></a>I come to Amendment 101BZZA. When one becomes a Member of your Lordships&#146; House, one finds all sorts of strange customs. The lettering of amendments is among them. I could swear that it has changed since I joined this House, but maybe not.</p>

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="09022329000076"></a><b><a name="90223-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022329000273"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> The problem is that far more amendments are now put down, for some reason.</p>

<p><a name="st_199"></a>

But it is not that; I think that the order of the zeds and so on has changed. I am getting support from behind me.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09022329000078"></a>Amendment 101BZZA aims to strengthen the duty to protect marine biodiversity when issuing a licence. There is a duty to have regard to the need to protect the environment, but that is a broad term. Again, this is an amendment that we tabled following an approach by the Wildlife and Countryside Link. We share its concern that a broad definition could result in every project trading off site-specific biodiversity against some more general, indeterminate global environmental gain.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09022329000079"></a>Amendments 101BZAC, 101BZBA, 101BZBB and 101BZBD all deal with consultation on licences. I apologise to your Lordships that I did not take these at the same time as the other amendments to Clause 66. The first of these would impose a requirement for the authority to consult all interested parties&#151;and please do not tease me about the use of the word &#147;interested&#148;. The authority would be required to seek and take account of advice from the statutory conservation bodies and all who know about these things. The detail of mitigating impacts, of imposing conditions and so on is so much within the expertise of a number of organisations that the Government, I am sure, would want them to be consulted in the application procedure.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09022329000080"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee&#146;s report focused on why a list of statutory consultees was not desirable, but we think that a simple requirement to consult without naming bodies or persons would meet the point. As in the previous amendment, electronic communication could be a blessing, not just a curse.  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_86"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There is also a proposal to change &#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148;&#151;a familiar amendment&#151;and to strengthen the Bill by leaving out &#147;from time to time&#148;.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09022329000081"></a>As for the other amendments in this group, Amendment 101BZAZA is consequential&#151;or pre-sequential, if that is possible. The other one, Amendment 101BZZB, would take from Clause 66 the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09022329000161"></a>&#147;and such other matters as the authority thinks relevant&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000142"></a>However, I have made a note to ask the Minister whether that in any way links to a provision in Clause 67 that puzzled me, albeit too late to table an amendment. I am sorry not to have given notice of the question; he may feel that he cannot deal with it this evening. Clause 67(8) allows the Secretary of State to certify that it would be contrary to national security to hold an inquiry, or for the public or particular people to be admitted to an inquiry. I thought that that was&#151;let me use a neutral term&#151;an interesting provision. On these Benches, we have an instinctive reaction against holding an inquiry in private or excluding certain people from an inquiry. I find it particularly curious that an inquiry could be public but that certain people could be kept out of it, unless of course they were causing a disturbance and, after due warning or whatever, the chairman of the tribunal or whatever it might be ordered them to be excluded. I do not know whether there is a link; I admit that this is a little tenuous, but I did not want to let the Committee go by without raising the matter to see whether we could explore why it is necessary.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09022329000082"></a>I am grateful for your Lordships&#146; indulgence on that long group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="09022329000083"></a><b><a name="90223-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09022329000275"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> We agree with the noble Baroness that relevant authorities should naturally be informed of applications for licences relevant to their areas, and should be able to feed any views of that application back to the licensing authority. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure her that the Bill allows for that, and that it is the Government&#146;s intention that interested and expert representations will be given the attention that they deserve.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09022329000084"></a>Again, I have some sympathy with the noble Baroness&#146;s concern that licences should be awarded only after considering the effect on biodiversity, but I am less supportive of the amendment to remove the provision allowing other matters to be considered. As our discussions on Clause 2 made clear, the list of matters that should be considered relevant for a marine body to have regard to when exercising functions is extensive, as well as being a challenge to define. It would be more appropriate to retain some flexibility in the area. Our own amendment in the group&#151;Amendment 101BZBBA&#151;makes it clear that appropriate public authorities, local authorities and IFCAs should be consulted before any application is determined. I hope that the Government will agree that that should be part of the process.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09022329000086"></a>I shall start with Amendments 101BZZA and 101BZZB, which insert additional considerations that the licensing authority must take into account when determining the application for a marine licence. Amendment 101BZZA makes it explicit that the need to conserve biodiversity should be taken into account. Amendment 101BZZB does away with any considerations not listed. Already it is clear that a number of sometimes competing interests would want to get a mention in the clause.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09022329000087"></a>Before addressing specific amendments, it might be helpful if I explain how licensing decisions will take into account sustainable development. As I have said in earlier debates, the marine policy statement will articulate our shared vision, and detailed policies and objectives, for the sustainable development of the marine area. It will bring together all our marine policies, covering social, economic and environmental considerations, to set a clear and consistent framework for decision-makers. Marine licensing authorities will take their decisions in accordance with policies set out in the marine planning statement and subsequent marine plans. In this way, marine licensing will give clear effect to the policies set out in the MPS and the marine plans. Case by case, licensing authorities will obtain relevant scientific input from expert bodies such as CEFAS, and information from other consultees, to allow evidence-based, holistic consideration of the overall impacts and benefits of any particular activity, while having due regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, and prevent interference with other users of the sea. These might be described as baseline considerations that have to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09022329000088"></a>Authorities will be able to add conditions to a licence that will help to mitigate any adverse impact of a proposal. If an activity is to take place in a marine conservation zone, the licensing authority will have further regard to the impacts of the activity on the conservation objectives of that marine conservation zone. The general considerations that a licensing authority can take into account by virtue of Clause 66(1) are therefore already broad.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09022329000089"></a>Amendment 101BZZA would separate the need to conserve biodiversity from the need to protect the environment. Under the Food and Environment Protection Act, the licensing authority must have regard to the marine environment and the living resources that it supports. However, the distinction between the marine environment and living resources may no longer be considered sound. International commitments on the protection of the environment in general, and of marine biodiversity in particular, now emphasise the holistic nature of marine ecosystems. It is the health of the ecosystems in the sea that contributes in large part to determining whether the marine environment as a whole is healthy. The quality of the seawater, seabed and seashore are vital, but so too are the things living in them, or affected by them.</p>

<a name="90223-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09022329000090"></a>We do not want to limit environmental considerations to the marine environment alone. For example, it may be necessary to consider the impact on the neighbouring terrestrial environment, to encourage coastal integration, and also to consider the need to protect the environment from global damage. It may also be necessary for the decision-maker to assess the relative significance of the effect of a proposed activity on the global and local environments.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90223-0013.htm"/>


<a name="90223-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09022329000091"></a>Amendment 101BZZB would remove the licensing authority&#146;s ability to consider any factor not listed in the Bill. We want the licensing authority to have the freedom to make decisions based on the particulars of any given case and on the evidence submitted to it. Given the sheer variety of activities that take place in the marine environment, it is important that anything of relevance to any single activity is considered. Indeed, it would be remiss not to do so. Examples of things that might need considering are other people&#146;s legal interests in, or rights to, the land; international good practice guidelines on how certain activities should be carried out; broader social and economic factors; and government policy as laid out in the relevant marine plan. This provision does not detract from the importance of the need to protect the environment and human health, or to prevent interference with other legitimate users of the sea. However, it does help the licensing authority to make holistic, sustainable decisions.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09022329000092"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, spoke to Amendment 101BZBBA. This would introduce a requirement on the licensing authority to consult the relevant IFCA or public authority if the application could influence a coastal, estuarine or nearshore zone. Amendments 101BZBA and 101BZBC would require the licensing authority to consult local authorities in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09022329000093"></a>We covered the so-called question of statutory consultees in an earlier debate and I do not want to go over old ground but, for a number of reasons, we are worried about having a list. First, there is the risk of the perception of two levels of consultees, with those listed in the legislation being seen as more important than those not listed. Secondly, there is the question of who should be a statutory consultee. Clearly, a diverse range of activities will require a marine licence. Consultees appropriate to an offshore wind farm could be very different from those for a small jetty at the bottom of someone&#146;s garden.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09022329000094"></a>Although consulting the appropriate bodies is essential to effective decision-making, forcing a licensing authority to consult every statutory consultee, regardless of whether it thinks that the application has any impact on its functions, might increase the time and cost of determining small applications which have minimal impacts. There is also the issue of proportionate regulation in this regard.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09022329000095"></a>A list is also inflexible, as we would need to amend primary legislation to take account of any changes to the bodies listed. A prime example is in Part 2 of the Food and Environment Protection Act, which, despite being concerned with the environmental impacts of deposits in the marine environment, requires consultation with the Food Standards Agency. Another example of the inflexibility of using primary legislation is the

He has tempted me by quoting the example of a small jetty at the bottom of someone&#146;s garden. That brings us firmly back to the issue of that shared zone between high water and low water where, absolutely rightly, local authorities already have a power. Surely, for that reason alone, even if the Minister does not want a long list, they have a particular reason to be consulted because they already have planning powers over that area.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="09022329000097"></a><b><a name="90223-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022329000278"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I knew I should mention that small jetty at the bottom of someone&#146;s garden, but I now very much regret it. In those circumstances, of course I would expect a local authority to be consulted, but there is a general problem with lists. Perhaps I can turn to the issue when I come to the amendment on local authorities. My general point is simply about lists in primary legislation. This is an area where legislation is pretty rare, so you have to be wary about what you put in the Bill for fear of seeming inflexible.</p>

<ul><a name="09022329000174"></a>&#147;consult any relevant public authority or IFCA&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022329000143"></a>It is not a list. It is a matter of considering what is relevant to the application and whether it should be considered. It is specific. If IFCA ceased to exist, no doubt there would be legislation for a replacement body, which would replace its functions in previous legislation. It is nothing more than putting into the Bill what the Minister is saying&#151;that licensing authorities would be consulted, because that is what they are about. They want to get it right. There is no list; it is just a matter of procedure. I am surprised the Minister is taking such a hostile view.</p>

I fully accept that the amendments in this group are partly probing and partly seeking to improve the consultative process, so I am sorry if I give the impression of hostility. I am rather trying to explain why there might need to be a more flexible approach. However, as I go through this, I also hope to reassure the Committee that there will ultimately be an effective process of consultation. This is not a fierce argument between us; it is about the general approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09022329000100"></a>If I might explain how we see the licensing authority doing this, we might perhaps reach a conclusion on whether it is the right approach. We envisage the licensing authority producing guidance on who should be consulted for which types of application. That is simply good practice, enabling staff to take a consistent yet flexible approach to consulting those persons most likely to have an interest or expertise in any particular application while seeking to minimise the burden on both consultees and the developer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09022329000101"></a>The Marine and Fisheries Agency has a list of those bodies that it regularly consults, depending on the expertise needed. I gather that the list includes bodies such as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science; the Crown Estate and Duchy of Cornwall; English Heritage; the Environment Agency; the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; local harbour authorities and planning authorities; the Maritime and Coastguard Agency; Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales; the National Federation of Fishermen&#146;s Organisations; the sea fisheries committees&#151;the precursor to IFCAs&#151;and Trinity House. Those are some of the bodies consulted at present under FEPA and the Coast Protection Act, without any specific legislative requirement to do so as the amendments propose.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09022329000102"></a>That list is relevant to Amendment 101ZC, which would require the licensing authority to notify the relevant local authorities of any applications that it receives for activities or developments in the inshore region. Clause 65(1) places the licensing authority under a duty to publish notice of any marine application. That goes beyond the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, which makes no such provision. Clause 65, as drafted, is designed to force the licensing authority to bring an application to the attention of persons who, in its opinion, are likely to be affected by or interested in it. It must be the case that local authorities would be included when the marine development is likely to affect the inshore region or the owners of transport infrastructure. Additionally, Clause 66(3) requires the licensing authority to have due regard to any representations that it receives from any person having an interest in the outcome of the application. That, too, must include local authorities. On top of that, Clause 66(4)(b) gives the licensing authority the power to consult any person or body that it sees as having an expertise in any matter arising from an application, which would clearly include local authorities if the development was in their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09022329000103"></a>We see these provisions, then, as allowing interested parties to have their say on licensing applications, while requiring the licensing authority to take into full consideration any points made by local authorities, or any other body, interested in or impacted by proposed development or activity. I feel that we have set out the broad principles and powers in the Bill to allow the licensing authority to use its professional discretion about whom to consult on a case-by-case basis, but in all the circumstances that I mentioned I have made it clear that local authorities will be consulted.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09022329000104"></a>On Amendment 101BZBB, I need to clarify the effect of Clause 66(4)(b), which makes it clear that the licensing authority can take into account the views of other bodies on particular cases. Clause 66(4)(a) makes it clear that it can also consult about its general approach to exercising its functions, but it necessarily cannot do that continuously or every time it undertakes a function&#151;hence the inclusion of the words &#147;from time to time&#148;. It is a point of administrative process in giving people affected by those functions an opportunity to comment on and inform them.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09022329000105"></a>Amendments 101BZAZA and 101BZAB would place a requirement on the licensing authority to have regard to representations that it receives from any persons, not just those who have an interest in the outcome of the application. Amendment 101BZAC would have two effects: first, it would place a requirement on the licensing authority to take account of representations from people with particular expertise in any matter associated with the development; and, secondly, it would force the licensing authority to publish details of how it dealt with any representations and any reasons for not following expert advice. Amendment 101BZBD would provide a power for the licensing authority to set out in regulations more detail on the consultation process for applications. Amendment 101BZBE would make it clear that any such regulations could include provision for notifying any persons who make representations during an application as a result of that application and for the advertising of each licensing determination more broadly.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09022329000106"></a>On the specific question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, by &#147;an interest&#148; in the outcome of an application, we mean not simply a legal interest, such as right, title or legal share in the outcome, but people who are directly affected by it in some way. The licensing authority must have regard to representations from such people. I respond positively to the noble Baroness&#146;s supplementary question. There is nothing to prevent the licensing authority from paying regard to representations from people without the kind of interest that I have just described, including those who may have expertise in any particular area. It is hard to imagine, for instance, that the licensing body would not have regard to a representation from an expert body that it had directly consulted. However, we do not think that there is a need for express provision in the Bill. In some cases, a large number of sometimes frivolous representations may be made by those without an interest, and there is an issue about having a legal obligation to have regard to all of them, which could be bothersome and time-consuming. We are trying to get the right balance between proper consultation taking regard of views and proportionate regulation.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09022329000107"></a>The licensing provisions laid out in this part establish the overarching framework and principles for the new licensing regime. Under Clause 66, each licensing authority will produce secondary legislation that lays out all the applications and decision-making processes in more detail. These details are something on which we want to work closely with all interested parties, including NGOs and industry. We are planning to launch a first early consultation on this legislation in the next few months, followed, subject to the passage of the Bill, by a further consultation on the draft statutory instruments. We want to work closely with all relevant organisations on that. Consultations are a key part of the applications process, all aspects of which will be worked up in regulations under Clause 66(6), so we do not see a need to make specific reference to the consultations process in subsection (6). We plan to include in these regulations the issue that noble Lords have raised in their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09022329000108"></a>Amendment 101BZBE is about when and how the licensing authority should publish details of how it dealt with any representations received, whether and when it should notify any person or bodies that made representations in relation to any application of the determination and whether to advertise it more generally. This is something that is done under regulations such as for local planning applications and is something to which we will give careful consideration. It is our intention that these issues should be addressed in secondary legislation and we want to work with interested bodies in putting forward sensible and efficient solutions.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09022329000109"></a>On the question the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised, Clause 66(1) is about allowing the licensing authority access to all the facts needed to make a holistic, evidence-based decision, and Clause 67(8) is about national security as a clearly necessary provision, although we would expect the licensing authority to need to use that very rarely. I will write to the noble Baroness with more details about the circumstances in which we think that might arise.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09022329000110"></a>I have responded at some length but these are important matters. As a general comment, we believe that the Bill is sufficient, that the necessary provisions are there and that they allow the process to be carried out in a proportionate way. We are wary about the listing which a number of amendments propose.</p>

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="09022329000111"></a><b><a name="90223-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022329000281"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I listened with great care to the Minister but I do not feel he has dealt adequately with Amendment 101BZBA, which is the famous may/must dilemma. He needs to look carefully at Clause 66(4) because, frankly, it does not make good sense at the moment. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09022329000162"></a>&#147;A licensing authority may from time to time consult any person or body it thinks fit&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000144"></a>There are two qualifications already. It is a very weak statement. If, as the Minister was saying earlier, it is so obvious that the licensing authority has to do this, why put the subsection in there at all? It is so permissive and obviously not mandatory that the licensing authority will, in these terms, ignore it. If it is going to be covered by secondary legislation, which the Minister implied in a more general sense about this group of amendments, why is it here as well? There may be a better case for making subsection (4)(b) permissive, but these qualifications in subsection (4)(a) offer a let-out for the licensing authority if the wording is left as vague as that. I do not think that is satisfactory. I acknowledge that the Minister&#146;s response to many of the other points raised by my noble friend Lady Hamwee and others has been substantial, but on this amendment it has not been sufficient. Since it has the support, unusually, of both opposition Front Benches, I hope he will be able to give us a better answer or at least undertake to look at this again.</p>

Subsection (4)(b) clearly relates to a case-by-case issue and subsection (4)(a) is rather more about the general approach. I think that that is a fair distinction. He says that because of the word &#147;may&#148;, the licensing authority will not use it. I beg to disagree. The discretion contained and implied by the word &#147;may&#148; as opposed to &#147;must&#148; is perfectly appropriate.

I will not attempt to run through all the points. Like my noble friend, I acknowledge that there is a good deal in much of what the Minister says and I understand the points he makes. Local authorities are a special case, however. We are labouring on the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill elsewhere and some of us keep arguing that representative democracy is what local authorities do, and they should be recognised as having a particular status because they have a particular role. As for the definition of persons who are interested, the Minister&#146;s definition seems to be somewhere in between the two examples that I used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09022329000114"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to write to me about Clause 67(8). Having noticed this very late in the day, we may well want to come back to it, if only to get his answer to me on to the record. One understands that there are matters of security that may need a very particular approach, but they are so particular that it is right that they should be on the record. I thank him for his very detailed response to all my amendments, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09022329000116"></a>As your Lordships will no doubt recall, I tabled similar amendments when we discussed marine policy statements. Those amendments were not accepted, primarily on the ground that including a list&#151;we are back to the list again&#151;that does not encompass all permutations of sustainable development risks overemphasising some at the expense of others. To head off that criticism of these amendments at the start, I emphasise that they are not intended to ensure that renewable energy should be given preferential treatment when applying for licences, although I should add that they derive from a briefing from the British Wind Energy Association; they are intended merely to allow for a debate on the meaning of paragraph (a), under which licensing authorities must have regard to protecting the environment.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09022329000117"></a>As my amendment makes clear, &#147;environment&#148; can mean very different things to different people. Protecting the local environment would no doubt result in care being taken to ensure that the pollution or degradation of the surrounding area is kept to a minimum, and perhaps that the recreational needs of people living in the immediate coastal area are met. When we look at

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09022329000120"></a>Amendment 101A seeks to test the meaning and concept of &#147;environment&#148;, and introduces the concept of the local and the global environment. He gave the very good example of the tension between the local environment and renewable development, which would contribute to the global environment but might have an adverse impact on the local environment. This was dealt with in the Explanatory Notes to Clause 66, which say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="09022329000164"></a>&#147;The reference to the &#145;environment&#146; should be given its ordinary meaning&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022329000145"></a>My understanding is that that means that it should include both the local and the global environment, the natural environment and, indeed, any site of historic or archaeological interest. The natural environment includes the physical, chemical and biological state of the sea, the seabed and the seashore, and the ecosystems within it or those that are directly affected by an activity, whether within the marine licensing area or otherwise.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09022329000121"></a>The problem with defining the term &#147;environment&#148; more explicitly is that you might narrow the definition rather than broaden it. We want the definition to be as broad as possible to encompass all the possible impacts that a development can have on the environment. We clearly want the licensing authority to have the freedom to make decisions based on the particulars of any given case and the evidence submitted to it. It should not be restricted by a narrower definition of what it can and cannot consider, which would in turn reduce its ability to make sustainable, holistic decisions.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09022329000122"></a>Amendment 101B would give the licensing authority explicit duties to consider the impacts of developments on mitigating climate change and the need to maintain security of energy supplies. We consider that the licensing authority can already consider the impacts of mitigating climate change as part of its consideration of global environment factors. Climate change is possibly the greatest challenge facing humankind and its importance cannot be overstated. However, healthy local marine environments and marine biodiversity play an important role in absorbing carbon and therefore reducing climate change.</p>

<a name="90223-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09022329000123"></a>The tension described by the noble Lord will need to be taken into account in the decisions made by the regulatory body, which will be informed by the marine policy statement and marine plans in guiding the determination of licensing decisions. The marine policy statement will draw on all the national policy statements affecting the marine area. It is in this part of the process that considerations such as security of energy supplies  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be factored in. Licensing decisions will be made in accordance with those plans. Clearly, there will be a balance between developing wind farms or other forms of offshore renewable energy developments, and in those areas such considerations will filter down to case-by-case licensing decisions. In other areas, the emphasis might be different. However, I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured that we think that the regard the licensing authority will have to pay in Clause 66(1) to protecting the environment encompasses the very points to which he wishes to draw our attention. On that basis, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

However, it continues to worry me that in recent years we have passed about four Acts. If we are not careful they will become just one compartment. I reinforce what my noble friend has said. The impact of climate change is very real and is here, and I think we all agree that it needs to be addressed. It is the same with the security of energy supplies. Although the Minister has indicated that Clause 66(1)(a) and the need to protect the environment would be taken into consideration, I hope that he might give the matter further thought. It really worries me that to members of the public there is the Climate Change Act, the marine Bill and the Energy Act. I do not think that it would be amiss to include the two specific suggestions made by my noble friend. In the light of my contribution, I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter.</p>

The problem with accepting the amendment is that it almost qualifies what is meant by the term &#147;environment&#148;. In seeking, as the noble Baroness rightfully does, to give greater clarity to the matters that will fall to be considered under this legislation, the problem is that, by defining it in the way proposed in the amendment, the definition is narrowed.

I know that we have had a lively debate about the interrelationship between the NPS and the MPS and that that raises some difficult issues for noble Lords.

Before I turn to those amendments&#151;I do not intend to delay the Committee for too long&#151;I want to welcome noble Lords to the Committee and say how much I am looking forward to our debates on the Bill&#146;s further stages, in particular that in Grand Committee. My first experience of Grand Committee was during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2008. All of us felt that that Act was improved by the important contributions of noble Lords, although I very much hope that we will keep our debates shorter than those we had on that Bill. I look forward to a similar quality of debate on this Bill; that has already been demonstrated by the informed contributions made at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000004"></a>I turn to government Amendments 1 and 2, which are minor, technical amendments. They make it clear that the constitution and handbook referred to in the Bill are the versions published on 21 January. I am pleased that the NHS Constitution was published very shortly after First Reading; that meant that noble Lords have had the opportunity well in advance of Second Reading to consider its contents. Noble Lords will be aware that the Bill was published on 15 January, which was, of course, prior to the publication of the constitution, and therefore the specific dated constitution and handbook could not be referred to when the Bill had its First Reading. As we are asking the NHS to have regard to the constitution, it is important that the legislation is crystal clear about the document we are referring to, which is why the Government have tabled the amendments. I hope that noble Lords are content with these minor amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000007"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0902231000107"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I hope that the amendment&#146;s purpose will be immediately understood by the Committee. It is to suggest to the Government that the question of how much or how little of the NHS Constitution should be reflected in the Bill can be settled in a more satisfactory way than that which the Government have chosen.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000008"></a></p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000009"></a>On looking at the available possibilities, there are two extremes at either end of the spectrum. One would be to place the entire NHS Constitution in the Bill. The Government have rejected that option for the perfectly understandable reason that it would ossify the constitution in primary legislation. The other extreme is not to include any of the constitution in the Bill. Ministers have opted for that course, ostensibly because they wish to leave scope for the constitution to be revised and amended from time to time without having to refer to Parliament. The problem with that option is that it will leave the law saying nothing about what kind of declaration the NHS Constitution should be. We are in a situation where Parliament is given no say in fashioning or shaping the constitution, even in the most general terms. That, to say the least, seems odd when the separate statement of NHS accountability, which the Government have published, makes it clear  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that at the national level the Department of Health is accountable to Parliament. Where is the accountability here?</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000010"></a>The NHS Constitution, as we heard in the preceding amendment, was written, signed off and published in an exercise that was completely detached from the parliamentary process. Given that we are dealing with a document of such apparent significance for the health service and for patients, I am disappointed and uncomfortable with that approach. The other problem with the resounding silence in this part of the Bill is that it carries with it the implicit assumption that there is nothing in the nature of an enduring or universally agreed statement of values that will serve to underpin the NHS Constitution over the long term. If there is literally nothing that we want Parliament to say about the values and core principles of the NHS, what message does that send out about the reliance that people should place on that document? It is as though the Government are saying that not even the principles on which the NHS is founded can be set in stone, lest they might in the future have to be changed.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000011"></a>Hence, I have tabled the amendment. Its purpose is to suggest that there might be a sensible halfway house between the two extremes I have referred to. What we should try to do, indeed what we owe it to the country to do, is to encapsulate in the Bill those core principles without which the NHS would not be the NHS that we want it to be, and without which any constitution, to put it bluntly, would not be worth the paper it is written on.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000012"></a>The set of principles I have included in the amendment are those that were articulated and agreed nine years ago in the NHS Plan. They are not my words, although I think that they are very good words. As in 2000 when the great and the good of medicine appended their names to the preface of the NHS Plan, they are principles with which no one will take serious issue. Interestingly, the amendment contains two principles that are not explicitly included in the NHS Constitution: first, that the NHS will support and value its staff, and, secondly, that public funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to NHS patients. Why does not the constitution expressly repeat these two core undertakings from the NHS Plan? We see in the constitution seven principles that,</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000092"></a>&#147;guide the NHS in all that it does&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000013"></a>The third principle refers to the NHS aspiring,</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000093"></a>&#147;to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000072"></a>and staff are mentioned in that context. However, ensuring that staff achieve high standards is not the same as saying that those staff will be supported and valued. You have to turn to section 3a of the constitution to find anything resembling the words &#147;support&#148; and &#147;value&#148;, and what you do find is expressed only in the form of a pledge and not a core principle. Why is that?</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000014"></a>As regards public funds for healthcare, we see a slightly weaselly version of the principle in the NHS Plan. Instead of an undertaking that public funds will be devoted solely to NHS patients, we see that public funds for healthcare will be,</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000094"></a>&#147;devoted solely to the benefit of the people that the NHS serves&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0902231000073"></a>What is the significance of this change of wording? What other groups of people are embraced by the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000095"></a>&#147;the people that the NHS serves&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000074"></a>It seems to me a potentially much wider cohort than simply NHS patients.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000015"></a>Therefore, my questions to the Minister are twofold. First, do the Government still subscribe to the core principles of the NHS Plan, and, if so, why have these not been transposed into the NHS Constitution? Secondly, if we agree that the core principles of the NHS Plan are good and enduring, will he agree to consider including them in this Bill as a means whereby Parliament can both endorse the constitution and warrant to the public that the values underpinning it are not ones that Governments of whatever political persuasion will tinker with? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000016"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0902231000108"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> Those noble Lords who took part in the Queen&#146;s Speech on the health debate will remember that I am not a fan of this constitution. However, I am told that no one is more welcomed through the gates of heaven than a sinner who repents. In this context, I am still a bit of a sinner. I am not wholly repentant but studying the Second Reading debate and certainly taking into account the views that I have heard throughout the country, I recognise that on the whole people are very much in favour of the constitution. Therefore, I have come round to thinking that it is something that we need but I think that it should be made as good as possible.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000017"></a>In that context, I very much share the views of my noble friend in that I think that the Bill is wanting when it comes to the constitution in that it omits the fundamentals and, in particular, the influence that Parliament can have on the future NHS. An organisation that is principled is one that is trusted. Principled people have clarity of thought and a philosophy that guides them. There is widespread agreement that, with regard to the law, stated principles give confidence to service users and their families, they support and guide professionals, they assist in tribunals and give consistency in casework, and they inform the exercise of discretion under the law. I think it is essential that those who have to interpret the law should have this knowledge.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000018"></a>I do not know the Minister&#146;s views but, judging by some of our past experience, I am sure that he will be thoughtful. He will consider the matter very carefully and, I hope, return to this House with his own amendment. However, I suspect that his briefing will say, probably in mandarin-speak, &#147;Beware. Don&#146;t touch it. This is a trap&#148;. If we go by past experience, the Government will be shy of putting the principles into the Bill, but that is in contrast to our fellow legislators in Scotland, who are rather braver. When we debated the Mental Health Bill, which became the Mental Health Act 2007 and revised the 1983 Act, the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, was sympathetic but he thought that it was not practically possible to add principles to an existing Act. It might have been possible if the Act had been replaced in its entirety, he told us. He argued that the Act already contained   


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implicit principles and that it would not make for clarity to add explicit ones. He undertook to explore the issue but made no promises about the outcome.</p>
<h5><a name="0902231000099"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000019"></a>The subject was further debated on Report, when the Minister again expressed his sympathy but also doubts about causing confusion if principles were inserted into an Act that already contained principles. However, he agreed to introduce on Third Reading an amendment about principles, although this would relate to the code of practice and not the Act. This Bill is not on all fours with the Mental Health Act because it is not a revision of a previous Act but is new in its entirety. I am optimistic that the Minister will have inherited the sympathy shown by his predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and adopt the Government&#146;s approach to two previous Bills, the Children Act 1989 and, more recently, the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Despite the principles being on the face of these two Acts, I am not aware that there have been any problems, litigation and the like. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the Committee if that is so.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000020"></a>As my noble friend has explained, our suggested core principles are taken from the 2000 NHS Plan. That plan is nearly 10 years old and those principles still stand firm. I suggest that they are rather better than those contained in the constitution, but which, of course, are not on the face of the Bill as it stands at the moment. There are only seven principles in the constitution as opposed to 10 in our amendment, the first of which is split into two. The third principle in the constitution is &#147;aspiration&#148;, as my noble friend has said, and, although I rejoice in the focus on professionalism&#151;I am delighted about that&#151;using the interpretation in the handbook of &#147;aspiration&#148;, it could be seen more as a pledge than a principle.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000021"></a>In contrast, all our amendments and those principles taken from the 2000 health plan contain the verb &#147;will&#148;. This means business and is executive. The principle contained in subsection 2(b) of our proposed amendment concerning the provision of comprehensive services is omitted from the Government&#146;s principles. Are the Government running away from offering a comprehensive range of services or are they&#151;this is not a rhetorical question; I should really like to know&#151;in this difficult financial climate, saying, &#147;Sorry, but we can no longer afford to offer a comprehensive range of services&#148;? That would worry me, but I could understand it because it could be a legitimate strategy. However, if it is, it should be overt and not shielded simply by omission. Perhaps the Minister will explain the position to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000022"></a>In our proposed new clause, subsection 2(e) states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000087"></a>&#147;the NHS will work continuously to improve quality services and to minimise errors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000075"></a>With a Minister who has breathed, led and never ceased to impress the NHS with his championing of quality, and a CMO who is recognised the world over for his commitment to safety, I am amazed by the omission of this principle. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee why it is not included. Other voids in the constitution&#146;s principles are the supporting and valuing staff, devoting public funds to NHS patients, keeping people healthy and a respect for confidentiality.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000023"></a>We could have pages of principles but there is merit in brevity. The Ten Commandments have stood the test of time and if we had only kept to them perhaps we would have a healthier society. We have set out 10 principles in our amendment which I hope the Committee will consider helpful as an important suggestion to improve the Bill and, much more important, to provide an anchor for patients, public, carers and staff when they consider the fundamentals that surround the NHS. I support my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000024"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0902231000109"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> I have the greatest respect for the noble Earl who proposed the amendment and the noble Baroness who spoke to it but I have to express some personal concerns about its content. When we debated the Bill at Second Reading it was stressed, rightly so, that the NHS Constitution is not a code or a statute but a set of guidelines. It is clear that the Bill makes it apparent that people working in the NHS and those who are subject to its rules and regulations must take account of or take note of or pay regard to the provisions of the constitution. With that I wholly agree.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000025"></a>It is clear that the principles set out in the amendment are admirable and totally unexceptionable. My concern is that if, as is the purpose of the amendment, this group of principles were embodied in the Bill, it would become part of a statute. I foresee the danger that if for any reason individuals of litigious intent felt that these principles were not being fulfilled it could give rise to litigation.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000026"></a>At Second Reading, I said how crucial it was that issues which are best dealt with by common law are handled by common law and not by prescriptive statutes. There are so many other principles that are a part of the National Health Service which are not included here and might be regarded as being of considerable importance. Nothing is said in these principles about the responsibility of the NHS for the education of healthcare professionals, nurses, other healthcare professionals, doctors and others, which is a crucial part of the responsibilities of the NHS. There is nothing said about the principles relating to the advancement of knowledge by research, which can nourish patient care and produce new developments which are vital to the future of medicine and patient care in general. Nothing is said about the crucial importance of the NHS nurturing advances in a vast range of medical technologies, which might equally have been included. Therefore, while its intention is very worthy, to embody the amendment in the Bill would be dangerous for some of the reasons that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000027"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0902231000110"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I have great sympathy with the principle of the amendment, because it states that the core principles of the NHS should be stated. We already have effectively four different NHS systems in the UK: devolution has meant that what is done in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England is at times very different. The experience of patients on one side or other of the border changes quite dramatically if they are referred across it. We have a unified taxation system, so the funding of the NHS is on a UK-wide  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>basis. We do not fund the health service within a devolved Administration locally. In other words, we have a truly national, UK-wide health service, yet the constitution will apply to England. As it would be revised every three years, I am concerned that we may see some drift, that it may move with time away from the core principles of the NHS and that we will find that we have different systems in different places. It is therefore very important to define it.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000028"></a>I am concerned that &#147;evidence base&#148; does not feature in the words within the principles. I would like to see the evidence basis for what is done within the NHS flagged up as a core principle, because research and the accumulation of evidence should inform what is done. When there is no evidence, things should be abandoned and change thought about.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000029"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0902231000111"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> When I saw the amendment, it sparked the following questions in my mind: what happened in 1948? What were the core principles of the NHS that its founders believed should be stated and should endure? Was there a document in 1948? As far as I have been able to research it, there never was, which seems very strange when one considers the magnitude of the task which those brilliant men and women set for themselves; namely, to institute a comprehensive health service the like of which had never been seen. I have not been able to verify it, but I understand that the reason was that Winston Churchill decreed that, were there to be a set of principles for the NHS, they would be so general as to be meaningless.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000030"></a>That thought led me to ask whether, 60 years on, we need some principles. I rather think we do. I am not sure that these principles are even those that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, if starting from scratch, would have arrived at. However, we need some principles, because, 60 years on and in the light of our experience and the policy and legislative developments over that period, there is now a body of evidence about what brings about change and progress within a national health service.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000031"></a>I have spoken in the past three or four months about what I see as the looming issue for all of us, on whichever side of the House we sit, which is the grim prospect for public services expenditure over the next few years. I do not wish to be partisan in any way, but the question of public service expenditure will be top of the agenda for any Government of any hue.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000032"></a>In light of that and what we have learnt in the past 60 years, it may be time for us to go back to establish what should be some founding principles of the NHS and be safe in the knowledge that any list of principles now exists within a context of the development of a body of policy, a context of clinical practice and expectation and a context of patient expectation. I perhaps take a slightly different view from that of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff. Within the devolved system of the UK it is legitimate that we should begin to have different national health services which meet the needs of different populations. That said, I should be interested to know what should be the enduring principles that go across all four Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000033"></a>For the future, there is a very interesting task to be done, which is to have a full consultation about what the enduring principles of the NHS might be. I said at Second Reading that the question of how patient data was used had been overlooked in the Bill. That has been an ongoing problem, probably since 1948, which has never properly been resolved: how do we deal with the conflicts between the need for individual patient confidentiality and the need to generate population data in order to facilitate research? That is a big question that, 60 years on, we could and should look at in an open way.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000034"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is trying to do. I am sorry that I have to direct my questions to him as the author of the amendment, rather than to the Government, but he has hit upon an issue&#151;perhaps in not quite the right way&#151;which is the gap at the heart of the NHS about what its principles should be in this day and age, and for the future. The idea should be taken forward in a slightly different way.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000035"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0902231000112"></a>Lord Rea:</b> Even before the noble Earl, Lord Howe, moved his amendment in his usual eloquent and persuasive manner&#151;it was elegant, too, actually&#151;I felt that the Bill should say more about the basic principles of the constitution. I am sure that my noble friend would agree with the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that all 10 principles are absolutely acceptable and completely worthy, and that they are in line with the kind of NHS that Aneurin Bevan envisaged. That is not to say that they are the last word; we can amend them or add to them before the Bill leaves this House, and the other House can do the same, and the point made by my noble friend Lord Walton could be catered for. If these principles are in the Bill, that will not stop any future amendments to the detail of the NHS Constitution, provided that they fall in with these excellent principles.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000037"></a>I apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for missing the beginning of his remarks but I got the thrust of his arguments when I came in. He will not be surprised to hear that I am opposed to putting principles of this kind in a Bill unless it is absolutely necessary&#151;I have made many speeches on that. There was more of a case with regard to the Mental Health Act, as it became; we were trying to change, quite fundamentally, pretty ancient legislation 25 years after it had been framed. There is not a strong case here. Not content with constructing a constitution, we have a handbook on it as well, both of which can be amended over time as circumstances change.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000038"></a>The original authors of the NHS legislation&#151;its founding fathers, if you like&#151;were wise. They said that the Secretary of State would be under a duty to provide a comprehensive health service in England and Wales, as I recall, with a stony silence on precisely what &#147;comprehensive&#148; meant. That turned out to be very wise of the Labour Government of the time because three years later they had to introduce co-payments, which we call &#147;prescription charges&#148;.  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is what they had to do at the time of an economic crisis. Circumstances change and Governments have to respond to them. With the NHS now taking a very large chunk of the public finances, we have to be wise about not putting primary legislation on the books that unreasonably ties the hands of future Governments when dealing with the economic circumstances that they face.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000039"></a>This set of principles has a lot of flaws, which were elegantly and eloquently described by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. A big part of the NHS&#146;s job is to provide the education and training of the next generation of doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions. Increasingly, its R&amp;D role is incredibly important. With all the advances that we see in medical technology, it is important that the NHS plays its role in that area.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000040"></a>I am all in favour of taking wonderful Labour documents and enshrining them in legislation. The NHS Plan for 2000 was a wonderful document, but a document of its time. It did not say much about choice and competition. After that, choice and competition were introduced, and for a purpose; choice was certainly now a major part of the agenda, not just in the NHS but in the way that modern Governments respond to their citizens&#146; needs in the way they provide public services. Choice is an important issue for the future of the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000041"></a>We have moved on in many public services to accept a mixed economy of providers. Whether we like it or not, that is the world we live in. You could argue that we have always had mixed service providers in GPs, who are small business men and women from the private sector, so there is nothing very new about it. These are important issues, though, and the way that the amendment is framed, in terms of principles in primary legislation, would make it difficult for Governments to respond to changing circumstances and changing needs of societies. Often Governments make changes in something like the NHS because societies need change and they want, rightly, to be able to respond to that. These principles are too restrictive. I am afraid that while I understand the noble Earl&#146;s thinking, and I have a high regard for him, those principles would tie us into a set of restrictions.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000042"></a>If I were being unkind politically, I would wonder whether this was a picture of the NHS that a Conservative Government would bring before us&#151;basically, the NHS Plan circa 2000.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000043"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0902231000114"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> On Second Reading I said that I believed we should have had a Royal Commission on the health service. I believe that we should have had it a long time ago so we knew exactly what the health service was about, what it should do, what it should cost, who should pay for it and what have you. But since we have not had a Royal Commission we now have the NHS Constitution and we have an amendment before us that we are now considering.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000044"></a>I am old enough, of course, to have known Aneurin Bevan. He was kind enough to come to the Newbury constituency when I was fighting that hopeless seat to speak for me in the Corn Exchange there. I well remember that when he walked down the centre aisle,  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as he always did, he was jeered&#151;and I also remember that when he walked out he was cheered. He was a great man and responsible for our present health service. I am not at all sure that he would have welcomed this handbook.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000045"></a>Aneurin Bevan believed that the health service should be run by local people for local people and should be financed through taxation. I am not at all sure that he would have welcomed the centralisation of decision-making that has taken place over the years. All the research for the health service, or a good part of it, done by Bevan himself and by Beveridge, was done in the localities. The first thing that Harold Wilson said to me when I arrived at the House of Commons in 1970 was that he knew Swindon well; he had been the research assistant to Beveridge, who examined the system that the Great Western Railway put into position for its workers.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000046"></a>The whole concept of the health service was one which, although financed through national taxation, was in the hands of local people for local people. But of course things have changed; one understands that. Because things are as they are, I said again at Second Reading that perhaps we have the second best with regard to rights and duties of people under the present National Health Service through this constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000047"></a>I do not know whether the amendment before us wants to build on the constitution or whether it is necessary. The constitution probably sets out what people can expect and what duties they have, as well as what the staff should do, how they should be treated and how they should treat others. I am not at all sure that we want another amendment to be added to the Bill. However, if we are to add it, it needs to be looked at again.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000048"></a>There are phrases in the amendment that need to be tidied up. Proposed subsection (2)(a), for example, says that,</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000096"></a>&#147;the NHS will provide a universal service for all based on clinical need, not ability to pay&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000076"></a>The fact of the matter is that the NHS core principle is that it should be free at the point of use. Again, at Second Reading, I said that I believe that people should know how much they are paying for it. When people know that, they will demand a better service. The noble Earl might consider taking out &#147;not ability to pay&#148; and adding &#147;paid for by taxation&#148; so that people understand exactly where the money is coming from.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000049"></a>When talking about the health service&#151;which is a great service; do not make any mistakes about that&#151;I often say to people, &#147;How much do you think you pay for it? How much do you think the National Health Service costs?&#148;, and I am amazed at some of the answers I get from people who should be up to date with the costs of the health service. At a dinner&#151;I do not often attend dinners but nevertheless I was at one&#151;I was talking to someone about the health service and I asked him, &#147;How much do you think it costs?&#148; He said, &#147;Oh, &#163;4 billion a year&#148;. I said, &#147;Just go up a bit&#148;. He said, &#147;Well, it must be &#163;6 billion a year&#148;. I said, &#147;You are still not there&#148;. He said, &#147;Then it must be &#163;10 billion a year&#148;. I said, &#147;Would it surprise you to know that it is &#163;100 billion a year?&#148; That really put

I said, &#147;You are paying for it. No one else is paying for it&#148;. The other day I asked someone in the House of Commons how much the National Health Service was costing. He is responsible for raising the money, but he did not know; he thought it was about &#163;50 billion. There is a need for people to understand how much it costs because I am convinced that if they know how much it is costing them individually they will press for a better service. It happens elsewhere; there is no reason why it should not happen in the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000050"></a>I do not want to keep the Committee for too long but there are one or two other things that I really do not like about the amendment. The principle in proposed subsection (2)(d) states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000088"></a>&#147;the NHS will respond to different needs of different populations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000077"></a>There is only one population in the United Kingdom and it is made up of British people. These people are not &#147;populations&#148;, they are people. They may have different needs but they are part of the population. The Government, correctly, want to see integration and, if we are going to refer to &#147;populations&#148;, particularly on the face of the Bill, we will be going against the policy of integration which the Government, as I have said, quite rightly want to pursue.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000051"></a>The principle in proposed subsection (2)(e) states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000089"></a>&#147;the NHS will work continuously to improve quality services and to minimise errors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000078"></a>Of course it will; that is its duty. That principle is simply verbiage. You do not need something like that on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000052"></a>The principle in subsection (2)(g) states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000090"></a>&#147;public funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to NHS patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000079"></a>Who else will the funds be designated to? National health funds are for national health patients whether the services are provided in national health hospitals and other organisations or in private organisations, which seems to be an increasing possibility. I am not sure that the amendment is necessary.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000053"></a>Finally, the principle contained in proposed subsection (2)(j) states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000091"></a>&#147;the NHS will respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000080"></a>I agree with that, but I am not at all sure that it can be achieved by the &#163;12 billion which is being spent on the centralised computer system, which seems to fall behind year by year and seems difficult if not impossible to achieve. I am also very worried, bearing in mind the loss of people&#146;s data in so many government departments and elsewhere, that patients&#146; confidential records will be lost or leaked and seen by people who should not see them. I read in the newspapers&#151;perhaps the Minister will give us some assurance on this&#151;that patients&#146; records are to be seen by pharmacists, which would be outrageous. I hope that the Minister can assure the Committee and the country that pharmacists and pharmacies are not to have access to people&#146;s medical records through the computer system. I hope in relation to the present plans for centralised medical records that people will be able to contract in and not contract out, because inertia often means that people suddenly

<p><a name="0902231000054"></a>I appreciate that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is trying to be helpful, but I am not sure that his amendment would help in any way. Perhaps he could think about it and reword it following our discussion in this Committee.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000055"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902231000115"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I shall be brief, as I had not intended to speak at this point, but, having heard the debate, I felt that I wanted to come somewhere between the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. My first reaction is that I am very keen on principles being explicit in a Bill. I was anxious when I read this list and asked myself, &#147;What if they change?&#148;. I suppose that we are saying that principles may not change. I think that principles in the health service are changing. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, the health service has changed during the past 60 years, and it will fundamentally change again during the next few years. There may be things that we hold dear and precious which through the next few years we want to hold on to and, for that reason, people may want some principles in the Bill to protect them. I agree absolutely with the noble Earl that the difficulty is that Parliament has not been able to debate the constitution, which is where the issues should be more clearly enunciated. Along with my noble friend, I think that there are serious omissions in the list.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000056"></a>However, what has convinced me most today that these principles should not be in the Bill is the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, which showed that, if they were included, we should spend much longer discussing detailed semantics than in the previous debate. For that reason, having principles on which many of us would disagree would lead to difficulty.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000057"></a>Tomorrow, the House of Lords Select Committee of which I have been the chair will publish its report on cross-border healthcare. Some very interesting and controversial issues relating to payment, equality, authorisation and accessibility are in that document, which discusses the commission&#146;s latest notice on this subject. However, it is important to recognise that other issues will come through, not only regarding the devolved nations&#151;I agree absolutely with my noble friend Lady Finlay that we will learn from each other about different ways of managing health services through the devolved nations&#151;but we are fast becoming much more European. Some of us may not like that, but it is a harsh reality. As borders fall, health services will change.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000058"></a>My final point is about specialist services. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, talked about populations; the populations that concern me most are the small numbers of people who consume huge amounts of money, without which they would die. We have to hold on to that throughout our thinking. Equity and equal distribution are difficult concepts; postcode lotteries add to those difficult concepts and make principles difficult, sad as I am to have to say that.</p>

I have a single question for the opposition Front Bench. It arises from my conversation a couple of weeks ago with some colleagues at the other end and I can put it on the back of this amendment. Are the official Opposition satisfied with the general principles in the NHS Constitution, or is it the case that at some stage in the near future, in the event of a change of Government, they would want to revisit the NHS Constitution and, indeed, rewrite it? Would it endure for, say, at least a Parliament? That is all I wanted to ask.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000060"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0902231000117"></a>Earl Howe:</b> Perhaps I may answer that question now and get it out of the way. The broad answer is: yes, we are very happy with the principles set out in the constitution; they are worded well. The questions that I posed earlier were really around what was missing from those principles, because they do not entirely reflect those enunciated in 2000 when the NHS Plan was published. As I have said, those principles seem admirable and have stood the test of time. There is no intent to change, and there has been no discussion on our part on changing, these principles. Indeed, the whole point of my amendment is that Governments of whatever persuasion cannot tinker with the principles that underpin the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000061"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0902231000118"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may briefly make one or two points relating to subsection (2)(f) of the list in the amendment, which states:</p>
<ul><a name="0902231000097"></a>&#147;the NHS will support and value its staff&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902231000081"></a>Ten years ago when I first entered your Lordships&#146; House, I visited housing in the East End of London with a health visitor and was struck by her ability to access very vulnerable families. Over the years since then I have intermittently come across health visitors and I am sad to say that each time I meet them they have expressed serious concerns about how they are being treated and about recruitment and retention of health visitors.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000062"></a>I was very glad to learn of the success of family/nurse partnerships and I am pleased that the Government are planning to invest in recruiting more health visitors. However, I have been concerned about the treatment of health visitors and I should be most grateful if the Minister wrote to me about what specifically was being done to ensure a more secure future for this important service.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000063"></a>The general principle which I see very much in terms of the child and family workforce is that if one invests in the workforce and values it, one will deliver a good quality of care and good outcomes for children and families, and in the health service. This is one principle that is absolutely right and probably will not change over time.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000064"></a>Furthermore, there has been a great deal of change in child and family services, made with the best of intentions, and much of it has been welcome. However, the difficulty of constant change is that it can tend to demoralise the workforce. Therefore, supporting and valuing staff may also make policy-makers always think before they make further changes that may be detrimental to the morale of the workforce.</p>

I would like to see an additional principle, &#147;(k) the NHS will do its best to prevent infections&#148;&#151;something that worries many people who use the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000066"></a>The problem when you have a list is that things get left out. Lists therefore need to be flexible. As the handbook is going to be reviewed every three years, principles could be changed or added.</p>

<p><a name="0902231000067"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0902231000120"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> Amendment 3 would place the principles of the NHS Plan, published in 2000, in the Bill. It would also mean that the principles published in the NHS Constitution on 21 January and all future versions of the constitution should be adjusted to reflect this set of principles.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000068"></a>I appreciate that in tabling this amendment the noble Earl wishes to ensure that we do not lose sight of the principles set out in the NHS Plan. I reassure him that no principles from the NHS Plan have gone missing from the constitution. Where they do not appear as a principle they are reflected elsewhere, either as a pledge or as a legal right. For example, there is a principle in the NHS Plan that the NHS will respond to the different needs of different populations. That has been translated into a patient right in the constitution: to expect your local NHS to assess the health requirements of local communities and to put in place the services considered necessary to meet those needs.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000069"></a>The second principle that the noble Earl referred to was about valuing staff, which was also touched on by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. Obviously, staff are the NHS&#146;s most important asset, and we are fortunate to have 1.3 million staff working in it. The constitution reflects that by making a number of pledges to the staff, including pledges to provide staff with personal development, access to appropriate training and line management support, and pledges to provide support and opportunities for staff to maintain their health and well-being. The constitution&#146;s third principle also reflects the importance of education and training in the development of staff.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000070"></a>The noble Earl also raised the issue of the difference in the wording between &#147;patients&#148; and &#147;public&#148; and why we have changed one to the other. &#147;Patients&#148; applies to people already accessing the health service, but the NHS is for everyone, even for the well, in order to keep them well. The revised wording reflects that.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0902231000071"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege raised the issue of whether the NHS will provide a comprehensive service. The first principle of the constitution confirms that. The NHS will provide a comprehensive service, and it is the Government and the constitution that are trying to secure that, at least for the next 10 years. That is based on the Health Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000002"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the issue of quality and safety, and I am grateful to her for that. The third principle talks about how the NHS should aspire to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism in the provision of high quality care

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000003"></a>The constitution also sets out a patient&#146;s right to expect organisations to meet the required levels of quality and to make every effort to improve the quality of healthcare they provide. We hope that the Bill meets the aspirations of not just the high quality that the staff wish to provide, but also the high-quality care that the patients expect from the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, also referred to the NHS Constitution and said that it applied only to England. The devolved Administrations are of course free to make their own decisions, but I should like to reassure her that although the constitution applies only to England, none of the other devolved Administrations have moved away from the core principles on which the NHS was founded in 1948. This is our attempt to ensure that these are maintained. It has been suggested that the constitution will change every three years. That is incorrect. The constitution will not be renewed for at least 10 years; it is the handbook that will be reviewed every three years.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, raised the issue of education of healthcare professionals and the research aspects of it. I think I have covered the educational aspect of it. The third principle in the constitution recognises the importance of innovation and the promotion of research, but not at the expense of confidentiality. I return to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. Only healthcare professionals and people who owe the same duty of confidentiality as healthcare professionals are legally allowed to process sensitive personal information for medical and research purposes. Healthcare professionals are qualified and registered staff, such as doctors and nurses. Established NHS practice uses patient information when necessary to support research. We have seen many fruits of that research over the past 60 years, and we lead globally in many areas of research because of the NHS and its funding principles.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked whether we could be clearer about funding the NHS. The document published with the constitution, the <I>Statement of NHS Accountability</I>, states on its first page:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022310000053"></a>&#147;The NHS in England currently spends around &#163;100 billion a year&#151;equivalent to nearly &#163;2,000 per person on average.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09022310000049"></a>That is in the constitution, and I have no doubt that that will help many who use the NHS to understand the value of the care they receive.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000007"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that over the summer the constitution and the principles were consulted on extensively, specifically looking at the 10 NHS planned principles, which we have looked at since 2000. This extensive engagement with key stakeholders, when drawing up the constitution, allowed us to refine the principles set out in the NHS Plan. We  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now have a set of principles that has the support of patients, the public and the staff.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000008"></a>The large majority of respondents to the consultations thought that the principles articulated were broadly right; a small number of improvements were suggested and the final published version of the constitution reflected those comments.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000009"></a>It is important to remember why we have chosen not to include any part of the NHS Constitution in the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, eloquently said, &#147;We do not want to create a lawyers&#146; charter here&#148;. That is why this is a declaratory and not a legal document. I think we can all agree that we would not wish to see decision-making in the NHS become a preserve of the courts. Equally, enshrining the NHS principles in the Bill would set them in stone until primary legislation was changed. While it is certainly not my intention that the principles of the NHS should change in any significant way&#151;indeed, I see these principles as enduring&#151;I also believe that it is important that there is a degree of flexibility, as highlighted by my noble friend Lord Warner, in relation to the NHS as it grows and evolves. So the proposals in Clause 3 for the constitution to be reviewed at least every 10 years following full consultation with relevant groups allow for this degree of flexibility while ensuring that the principles endure.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000010"></a>Given my reassurance that the principles from the NHS plan have not been lost and that the principles in the constitution have been subject to a full consultation, I hope that I have convinced the Committee and that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09022310000011"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09022310000062"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> Before the noble Earl does that, I wonder whether I could clarify a couple of points. When I referred to pharmacists, I meant private pharmacies. I perfectly understand that in hospital pharmacies there is proper control. What one cannot be sure about is that there would be proper control within a private pharmacy. That is what I was talking about.</p>

<p><a name="09022310000012"></a>On the question of payment for the health service, not everybody reads the documents that the Minister quoted. I shall not say that it is my plan, because it is not, but consideration should be given by the Government to show perhaps on people&#146;s wage slips how much they personally are paying towards the cost of the health service&#151;like a health stamp, for example.</p>

If the general practitioner has been involved in that prescription, it is the general practitioner&#146;s right to share any information that he or she may find suitable with the pharmacist providing those pharmaceutical drugs. As for patients reading documents, it will be a great pleasure for the Government to find a way in which we can share this information about the &#163;100 billion that the taxpayer is spending on healthcare. On the question of exactly how much each individual is contributing, we all know that we are paying a significant amount of tax; we know exactly how much tax we pay. On an individual basis, people should be aware of the contributions that they make in tax.</p>

It is quite interesting that we have had the principles set out in the Children Act and in the Mental Capacity Act. That is not the Mental Health Act, which went into the code, but the Mental Capacity Act. Clearly it is unfair to ask the Minister if he has had any comeback from those principles set out in the Act, but I wonder if he could write to me. I would be interested to know whether putting principles into two of our Acts has introduced a lot of legal cases and disruption.</p>

Of course, I acknowledge the reservations that have been expressed about the amendment. I recognise the danger of putting lists in legislation. Everyone will have their views about the content of such a list. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, is right in saying that there is no mention of research and education, and I would agree that the phrase &#147;evidence based&#148; might usefully sit in the wording.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, said that the amendment would be likely to give rise to litigation. That is one worry that I have had about promulgating an NHS Constitution in the first place. I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but there is a risk in undertaking this very worthy exercise, which the Government have embarked on, that people will sit on their rights rather more firmly than they have in the past. Let us hope that that is not so.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000017"></a>I thought that the core principles contained in the NHS Plan were as good a collection of principles as any. So far as I know, no one has seriously argued with them up till now. If we are not to have anything, I must come back to what the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said. She was absolutely right: there is a gap to be filled here, and if we are not to have an amendment of this kind or something like it, we need to ask ourselves how we are going to fill that gap.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000018"></a>I would of course be concerned if the inclusion in the Bill of principles, however brief, gave rise to an increased risk of litigation, as I mentioned. I think that that point can be argued over in relation to the amendment as worded, and I say to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that, in my own mind at least, principles are not the same as rights or, indeed, pledges. They are separately listed in the constitution for, I would say, a very good reason. The noble Lord said that Governments should be free to change the principles in the future if they want to. However, I think that that is the very argument that people out there will not want to hear and it is why I felt that Parliament and this Bill should be allowed to say something about the content of the constitution. I give way.</p>

I think that that was in the thoughts of the people who wrote the founding legislation for the NHS. That does not mean that there

That is a positive thing to allow for. I was a little surprised that there was not a greater degree of concern about Parliament having been completely sidelined in this context but I shall of course reflect on all the contributions made. The Minister said that in practice there was no difference between the principles in the NHS Plan and those in the constitution, and I shall reflect on that as well. I observe only that at least one principle in the NHS Plan has become a pledge in the constitution and is therefore not enforceable. Therefore, I think that there is a difference between the two and we may be able to find other examples.</p>

That is the key question that everyone who has read what is termed &#147;the NHS Constitution&#148; has been trying to figure out. Great supporters of it are adamant that it will make a real difference to staff and patients within the NHS. They believe that it sets out a recognised framework for the way in which the NHS deals with individual patients and that it also sets out expectations which patients do, and should, have of how the NHS will treat them. Even its most staunch supporters and, indeed, some of its authors, cannot yet answer the question: what will be different in practice? I think that they would admit that, although they have high hopes and aspirations for it; however, they are unclear about what it will mean in practice.</p>

<p><a name="09022310000023"></a>The question of what the Bill is intended to do as a document which enhances practice within the NHS keeps recurring. It is answered to a limited degree by the handbook to the constitution. The purpose of these amendments is to try to come at some of the same issues that we discussed on the previous amendment, but from a different angle, and to try to incorporate what is in the handbook&#151;not to incorporate its every  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>word into the primary legislation, but to ensure that practitioners have regard for what is in the handbook and to increase its status.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000024"></a>The most important lines in the handbook are those that ask what the principles mean in practice. The handbook endeavours to exemplify what the principles will mean. Why go about it this way? In part, because I, like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and other Members of the Committee, am a veteran of the Mental Health Bill and the Mental Capacity Bill. I take this opportunity to challenge the version of history of the noble Lord, Lord Warner. The reason that there was a great deal of argument about the inclusion of principles in the Mental Health Act and the mental health code of practice was not because the Mental Health Act 1983 was being updated; there was a great degree of consensus on that. There was intense argument because the Government were proceeding with a piece of legislation which they claimed rested on a set of principles&#151;which it did&#151;but unfortunately only the Government and a few of their advisers thought that they were right and relevant. Everyone else from mental health users to the Opposition thought that the principles were wholly wrong.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000025"></a>Regarding the Mental Capacity Act, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, was right to say that because the principles were so novel in legislation it was important that they were included in the Act and they have been reflected in the many documents that have flowed from that piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000026"></a>It is important that we try to reach a middle way whereby it is a legislative requirement that providers of services have regard to the handbook without putting its detail into the legislation, because it is clear from the Government&#146;s actions so far that the heart of how the legislation will work will be embodied in the handbook, rather than in the constitution. I invite noble Lords to look at the constitution and the relevant bits of the handbook and draw the distinctions between them.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000027"></a>I pick one principle, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022310000055"></a>&#147;You have the right, in certain circumstances, to go to other European Economic Area countries or Switzerland for treatment which would be available to you through your NHS commissioner&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022310000050"></a>That is stated in the constitution. However, the handbook goes on to state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022310000056"></a>&#147;What this right means for patients&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09022310000051"></a>and sets out the limits of what that means in practice. In the spirit of this legislation and of what the Minister is trying to do, which is to be fair to be patients about what their expectations of the NHS should be, it would be beneficial to the NHS and its users that they are not misled by the simplicity of the NHS constitution and are openly directed towards the practicality of what that principle will mean for them. That applies as much to staff as it does to users.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000028"></a>Another example&#151;a very topical matter this week&#151;was the commitment on screening. If one were to read only what the constitution says about screening, one would not immediately understand that there are policies around screening programmes which have been worked out by the department on the grounds of their efficacy in certain groups. The more you can draw patients into   


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an understanding of how this document will work in practice, the more you will minimise unnecessary litigation and disruption to services. The three amendments are necessary because they place the duty of having regard to the handbook not only on providers of NHS services but on those who provide NHS services under contractual arrangements and on subcontractors. That is a deliberate thing on our part.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000029"></a>I continue to have an ongoing and interesting dialogue with the department about its interpretation of the 2010 competition for services regulations and the Part B derogation for health. At this point I know that noble Lords&#146; eyes will start to glaze over, but it is extremely important European legislation. I and many other people take the interpretation that it means that many areas of healthcare and social care are public services which have to be open to competitive tendering. Some people in government cling to a view that it does not. One day one of us will be proven right in a court of law but, whichever way one chooses to interpret it, it is an important matter, not least for the parts of the Bill dealing with direct payment and beyond. We have tried to make sure that this obligation rests not only with direct providers because we believe that in future a great many more healthcare services will be provided by subcontractors.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000030"></a>This is a slightly different way of making these principles have a meaning in the NHS as it is now. It is a commendable way of doing so because it does not tie down indefinitely in primary legislation the detail of the handbook, which remains capable of being changed and altered as it becomes relevant without amendments to primary legislation. This approach has worked, in slightly different ways, under the Mental Health Act and the Mental Capacity Act and I commend it as a good way forward. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09022310000031"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09022310000070"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I agree with all that the noble Baroness said as regards incorporating a duty to have regard to the handbook. My Amendment 8 is designed to meet that purpose. If anything, it is more important that people should be under an obligation to abide by the handbook than by the constitution in isolation because, of its very nature, as the noble Baroness indicated, the constitution is expressed only in headline terms rather than in terms of the explanatory substance in the handbook.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000032"></a>We need to remember that the handbook not only defines but, in some cases, limits the rights and pledges set out in the constitution. If the duty to have regard to the constitution is not accompanied by an equivalent duty in relation to the handbook, we are left wondering what status the handbook has. At the moment, it does not appear to have any at all. In purely practical terms, we want to be certain that people employed by the NHS operate with a clear understanding of what the constitution actually means rather than what they think it means. That is the central point at issue here.</p>

Amendment 8, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has a similar effect but uses an alternative method through a new clause.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000035"></a>I understand the intention behind these amendments, seeking as they do to strengthen the duty on bodies and persons to have regard to the NHS Constitution by extending this duty to the handbook. However, it is important to give some context to the Government&#146;s existing proposals.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000036"></a>We propose in Clause 2 that all providers of NHS care in England should have regard to the constitution. As noble Lords will know, the constitution is designed to be an enduring document that will, as I said previously, be updated infrequently and only after full consultation with patients, the public and staff. By contrast, the handbook is the explanatory guide to the NHS Constitution. It explains what the constitution means in practice, by setting out the law and departmental policy that underpin each right and pledge in the constitution. There is no right or pledge in the handbook that is not mentioned in the constitution, and the handbook itself does not create policy or law.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000037"></a>Although, of course, we expect those having regard to the constitution to be familiar with the content of the handbook, it is not a document that we intend should be legally taken account of by providers of NHS care. If I use my earlier analogy of the Bill that we are currently debating and the Explanatory Notes that go with it, I hope that that makes the case. Having regard to an explanatory guide is fundamentally different from having regard to the constitution, and I believe that a requirement in that regard may be unduly bureaucratic, given that NHS providers will in any event be familiar with the content of the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000038"></a>In addition, if there were an obligation to have regard to the handbook, there would also be a case for a more formal process for updating it&#151;for example, a requirement to consult on any revisions to the handbook.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000039"></a>Furthermore, strengthening the legal status of the handbook in the way that the amendments suggest could, ironically, make it a less useful and accurate guide for patients, the public and staff, because imposing a requirement to consult on any changes to the handbook would make it slow and cumbersome to update, even though most of the changes would be minor and technical. It would undermine our objective of ensuring that the handbook was readily revised and kept up to date. That objective has widespread support. For example, the Constitutional Advisory Forum, which oversaw

Having been brought up in the field of social care, where Bills and Acts sometimes contain a sentence that says that guidance may be issued from time to time, I saw the handbook as the guidance to the constitution. I would have found it helpful to have had that in the Bill, and to have had some wording following from the handbook that could be revised by the Secretary of State from time to time. That would give the provision more formality but would enable it to be changed, as any guidance can be changed, without unduly cumbersome consultation. I hope the Minister will think again about this.</p>

In it there are some serious paragraphs about patient and public responsibilities&#151;and they are very serious responsibilities indeed. Everyone in the health service will have a copy of this in the hospital, or wherever they work, in whatever part of the health service they work. But what about the patients? As I say, there are some strong words here about the responsibilities of the patients and the public. Is it planned to send this&#151;not the small, annotated version but the document itself&#151;to every household in the country? After all, the French were able to do that in relation to the European constitution; I do not see why we should not be able to do something like this as well. Is that the plan, or are patients and the public not to be considered?</p>

I hope I have answered that.

<p><a name="09022310000046"></a>There is something missing from this whole exercise if the document that most clearly sets out for patients and for staff what this is all meant to mean in practice&#151;and we should bear in mind that there is a big section about staff&#151;is unconnected from a constitution that the Government have decided should be based in law, but can have some kind of legislative force without it. I am not sure that I fully accept what the Minister says about the difficulty of updating it all, and so on; in so far as it is a document that reflects existing law and policy elsewhere, it consists largely of things that the NHS ought to make clear to its users. There is an argument, at least in my mind, that to do all that updating in the form of one document might be a more efficient way in which to go about managing relationships with staff and users.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022310000047"></a>I have listened to what the Minister said. I shall take it away and reflect on it, but I may well come back to it if, on reflection, I think that this is the most efficient way in which to keep this updated.</p>

That is the issue covered by this amendment. What in this context does the phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; actually mean in practice? The Government have made it clear that the constitution is not intended as a document that gives people legal rights over and above those that they have already. I take it, therefore, that &#147;have regard to&#148; falls some way short of &#147;slavishly adhere to&#148;. If it meant &#147;slavishly adhere to&#148;, it seems to me that new legal rights would indeed be created. If it does not mean that, it must imply that there are some circumstances in which it is not incumbent on health service bodies to abide by the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000002"></a>If a body is allowed in certain circumstances not to abide by the constitution, yet must at the same time be able to demonstrate that it has had regard to it, what does that obligation amount to in practice? What will distinguish a situation in which an NHS trust feels duty bound to follow the constitution and a situation in which it does not? That question is difficult to   


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>answer, but we have to do so. If we do not, we are open to the charge that the constitution is a piece of tokenism that can be followed or ignored more or less at will.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000003"></a>As we know, various rights are laid out in the constitution, such as the right to receive NHS services free of charge, which, if they are not honoured, are open to legal action and redress. But when it comes to the pledges, which are explicitly not legal rights, we have to ask what force they actually carry if there are undefined circumstances in which health service bodies do not have to abide by them but must merely have regard to them.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000004"></a>The other question that arises is how it will be possible to verify or audit the extent to which a trust has or has not had regard to the NHS Constitution. What happens if someone complains that the NHS, notwithstanding the pledge in the constitution, has failed to work in partnership with you, your family, carers and representatives? Let us suppose that the trust or PCT on reflection agrees that the complaint has some validity in the light of the prevailing facts. What factors can be adduced to show that the trust had had regard to the pledge despite not actually having adhered to it?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90223-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000005"></a>The constitution says that the NHS commits,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000198"></a>&#147;to ensure that services are provided in a clean and safe environment that is fit for purpose, based on national best practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000166"></a>What is it sufficient for a trust to do to have regard to this pledge? If it is found that a hospital environment is not clean and safe, is it nevertheless possible for that hospital to be acquitted of the charge that it failed to have regard to the constitution? What would having regard to entail in this situation?</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000006"></a>I think back to what the Minister said in his final report of last June, <I>High </I><I>Q</I><I>uality </I><I>C</I><I>are for </I><I>A</I><I>ll</I>. Among other things, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000183"></a>&#147;For the Constitution to be meaningful it must have bite, with means for enforcement and redress, not just warm words or aspirations&#148;.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000007"></a>How precisely does the constitution have the bite that the noble Lord referred to, and where are the means for enforcement and redress? The answer surely has to be that the means of enforcement and redress against the NHS are unchanged from what they always have been. If so, one is led to the rather sad conclusion that, in this sense at least, the constitution takes one no further forward. It does not deliver on what the noble Lord explicitly demanded of it. One might say, &#147;Oh constitution, where is thy bite? Oh handbook, where is thy victory?&#148;. All this points to something that has been highlighted by a number of commentators, which is that if we want the NHS Constitution to be effective and a force for good, people in the health service need to know that they have to perform in line with it as if their jobs depended upon doing so. It does not appear that anybody&#146;s job will depend upon how well or badly they do in this sense. There are no penalties for failure. It is, I am afraid, more a case of warm words and aspirations than anything more biting.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000008"></a>We need to hear from the Minister why he believes that &#147;to have regard to&#148; is a sufficiently robust form of words for the Bill and what, in practice, are the tests that will determine whether the duty to have regard to has been adhered to. I beg to move.</p>

Having been on the receiving end of many lectures over the years from the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about how the Government have created bureaucracy in the NHS, this looks like a crackingly good way of having returns from NHS authorities to show how they have had regard to adherence to the constitution and the handbook. I can now see the returns flooding into a future Government.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000010"></a>The noble Earl has rather overlooked the fact that we now have a new regulatory system in place under the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, which requires registration and a lot of information on the performance of trusts. We have strategic health authorities monitoring the performance of trusts. We have a complaints procedure with ultimately an ombudsman who is able to respond to those complaints, which will no doubt come in on failure to adhere to the constitution and the handbook. Moreover, we have a parliamentary system in which a Health Select Committee and others can hold to account both Ministers and civil servants on how the work is discharged. How many more systems do we need in this area? We have gone a long way to ensure that people are held to account. This looks to me like a bit of unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

He has enunciated in a couple of minutes precisely what is wrong with the National Health Service, if anything is wrong with it. People I meet and people I know who work in the health service think that it is a very good service, but that it is overly bureaucratised. So many bodies, committees, oversights, reviews, reports, audits and quangos&#151;do not forget them&#151;all chip in and interfere with what people are doing. I welcome what the noble Lord has just said.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000012"></a>I declare an interest. I no longer work in the health service, but my husband, who I live with, still does, despite retiring 18 months ago at the age of 65. As there is a shortage in his specialty, he has gone back to work. If he were here he would say, &#147;A plague on all your bureaucracy, just let us get on with the job&#148;.</p>

Perhaps I may slightly rephrase the amendment so that we can perhaps more easily understand what the noble Earl is driving at. The amendment states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000184"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State shall publish guidance on the manner in which bodies and persons&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09022328000167"></a>and so on. What the noble Earl is really saying is that central government shall publish guidance on the manner in which hospitals demonstrate that they have regard to the NHS Constitution. He is asking for a sort of bureaucratic, centralist determination of the policies to be pursued by hospital trusts to demonstrate the way that they apply the constitution. That is almost the very reverse of the devolution that we are seeking to introduce in the National Health Service. I cannot believe that that is what the noble Earl really believes.</p>

I understand the intention behind the amendment, seeking as it does to ensure that providers, commissioners and regulators of NHS services are fully aware of the duty on them and how they should fulfil it. However, it is important to give some context to the current intention as it is set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000015"></a>As my noble friend suggested, we do not intend the NHS Constitution to be a top-down initiative from the Department of Health, accompanied by a long list of requirements which have to be met in order to comply with it. The constitution was not developed in a top-down fashion, nor should it be implemented in that way. Indeed, the constitutional advisory forum said as much in its report to the Secretary of State. In order for the constitution to have the positive impact that we wish to see, it needs to be owned by every provider of NHS services.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000016"></a>A &#147;duty to have regard&#148; is a recognised legal term&#151;although I should point out that I am not a lawyer. It will ensure that the NHS gives the constitution proper consideration. Requiring compliance with the constitution would be inappropriate in two ways. First, it would be legalistic and potentially generate litigation, creating exactly the kind of lawyers&#146; charter that we debated earlier. Secondly, it would not be possible to require compliance in a legal sense with some parts of the constitution. For example, one of the values in the constitution is compassion. Compassion is clearly at the heart of what the NHS means to people who use it, but how could you go around assessing compliance with that value? Similarly, what would happen with patients&#146; responsibilities, which we debated at Second Reading? We all want the NHS to inform people about their responsibilities and help them to meet them, but what would it mean if an organisation had to comply with that?</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000017"></a>Issuing guidance on the department&#146;s interpretation of the duty to have regard to the constitution would be overly prescriptive and would change the nature and the spirit of the constitution. Equally, it would not be possible for the Department of Health to list every possible action that a provider, commissioner or regulator might have to take in order to be in line with the constitution. It would not be possible, or appropriate, to create a one-size-fits-all approach that applies as much to a district general hospital as to a dentist. Guidance could therefore bring with it the risk that bodies providing NHS services rely solely on it and not on their own assessment of what is needed to be able to demonstrate their having had regard to the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000018"></a>That is not to say that the department will provide the NHS with no assistance whatever in meeting its obligations. Indeed, some may know that David Nicholson has already written to all chairs and chief executives in the NHS with examples of how they might fulfil the proposed duty on them&#151;for instance, assessing existing policies and activities such as annual reports, staff or patient surveys to make sure that they are in line with  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the constitution, and checking against the constitution before publishing new policies or documents. We also have an extensive communications plan in place and we will use this to ensure that the NHS is aware of the duty on it and to help it think through how it will embed the constitution in its practices.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000019"></a>It is worth reminding the Committee that much of the constitution brings together policies which already exist. Most of the legal rights to which the noble Earl referred are already in existence and pledges are current Department of Health policy. The vast majority of the NHS should therefore already operate in line with the content of the constitution. I hope the noble Earl agrees that the duty to have regard to the constitution, along with the department&#146;s usual processes, are sufficient to ensure that the NHS pays appropriate attention to the constitution without the need for guidance and more bureaucracy from the centre and that he feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I was quite astonished to hear the contributions from noble Lords opposite that that is the effect they thought I was after. It is a way of addressing the cry that is bound to go up from NHS staff of, &#147;What on earth are we supposed to do? How are we supposed to obey the law that has been worded in this way? What do these words mean in practice? What force do they have?&#148;. I am none the wiser following the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000021"></a>For example, if I were in a charge of a trust or a PCT, I would worry what the phrase &#147;a comprehensive health service&#148; means. I could have regard to the constitution in my own way but I might not be certain that I was doing so properly. It is not a question of listing every possible action that people need to take; it is a question of making clear what deliberative processes NHS staff should go through and the kinds of considerations that need to be borne in mind. I am left wondering whether the constitution has the kind of bite the Minister hopes it will have or whether it is, when all is said and done, a set of warm words. That is the point at issue.</p>

<ul><a name="09022328000199"></a>&#147;continues to be available to patients, staff and members of the public&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000024"></a>The amendments ask the basic question of what exactly is meant by this. The people who are going to need the NHS Constitution the most&#151;that is, the people who are most going to need to rely on the rights and pledges it contains&#151;are those members of society who are in some way disadvantaged and whose voice is less loud: the elderly, the disabled and the very sick. If those groups are not aware of what the constitution says and how it can help them, then the benefits that we all hope will flow from the constitution will be considerably diluted.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000025"></a>Awareness here is surely key. If we agree about that, we must also agree that both the constitution and the handbook have to be not just &#147;available&#148; but easily accessible to everyone who has a need or potential need to know and understand their contents, especially vulnerable groups. People have to know what their rights are and how they can challenge poor treatment if they receive it. They need to have things rapidly put right whenever mistakes are made. Therefore, it is essential that the availability of the constitution and the handbook is not dependent on chance or on people scouring the NHS for it.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000026"></a>I think back to the Patient&#146;s Charter, which in its time was a good initiative. However, its effectiveness rather fizzled out because the incoming Labour Government did not put their weight behind it and, as a result, everyone forgot about it. Essentially, it disappeared off people&#146;s radar. The Minister will no doubt say that the Patient&#146;s Charter cannot really be compared with the NHS Constitution because, for one thing, it was not backed up in statute. I understand that distinction but my point is that, whether or not a constitution or a charter is backed up in statute, it is as good as useless if it is not promulgated to those whom it is meant to help&#151;that is, the people who deliver and are in receipt of services. That applies not just to a few but to every household in the land, and it is an ongoing process&#151;something that has to be kept up year after year.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000027"></a>I should like to hear from the Minister how it is envisaged that the constitution will be made available, to use the word in the Bill. I am not altogether happy with that word; I should have preferred &#147;accessible&#148; but I have gone for the phrase &#147;readily available&#148; to give a sense that the availability is not just dependent on consumer or user &#147;pull&#148; but also requires some &#147;push&#148; from the provider or commissioner end. I beg to move.</p>

It is crucial that the constitution and handbook are very widely available&#151;in public libraries, GPs surgeries, hospital outpatient departments and so on&#151;so that it is readily available to all members of the public who wish to consult it. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment.</p>

We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that the constitution should be readily available. If we are to have this constitution, it is important that it is in a format that is accessible to all people, whichever language they speak and regardless of whether they are physically challenged in any way. Presumably it will have to be in Braille and in a format that is easily read and understood by people with learning disabilities too. If it is to be available, it must be readily available to all those groups and must therefore be in every health service premises.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000030"></a>I wondered, rather whimsically, whether, on qualifying, all NHS staff&#151;doctors, in particular&#151;should drop the Hippocratic oath and learn to recite the NHS Constitution before being allowed to practise in the NHS. Alternatively, as used to be the case in some churches in this country where the Ten Commandments were written on the walls, perhaps in each waiting room of every health service establishment the constitution could be available in several languages. It would give people something to do other than look at the goldfish; it would be an interesting diversion.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000031"></a>I think that these amendments are very important if the constitution is to mean anything. We are not suggesting that it should be chained to the wall&#151;again, an ecclesiastical reference. It is not a chained Bible but it should be readily available in a form that is understood by everyone and it should be in every NHS premise.</p>

Amendment 10 seeks to provide after Clause 3(1) that each of the bodies under a duty to have regard to the constitution should display the constitution, and that each of those bodies must be able to provide a copy of the handbook for reference.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000033"></a>It is important to reassure the Committee that the constitution and the handbook will be readily available. As the Constitutional Advisory Forum pointed out in its role as the guardian of the constitution process, a critical success factor in ensuring that the constitution takes effect will be the approach taken to communicating its content. I have no doubt that when we assess the impact of the constitution we will know the impact of our communication strategy.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000034"></a>Communication of the constitution will be a core priority, both locally and nationally. The department is working closely with the NHS in developing various means of communications to help the NHS to raise awareness and promote understanding of the constitution among staff, patients and the public. I assure noble Lords that we intend access to the constitution to be as broad as possible. We are devising several communication methods and producing the constitution in many alternative formats to spread the message. The constitution and the handbook are, of course, available on the internet but, for those who do not

<p><a name="09022328000035"></a>I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that the constitution will be translated into other languages. It will be available in Braille, in large print and in audio, and the Government are finalising an easy-to-read guide which can be used by children and those with learning difficulties. All these documents will be widely available.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000036"></a>The communication of the constitution will not be a prescriptive, top-down approach, as we have debated before; it will be for the local NHS organisations to determine the best place to display the constitution and the handbook. I have no doubt that PCTs, acting on behalf of their local populations, will find the constitution an extremely useful tool to help in sharing with the users of the service what their rights and responsibilities are.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000037"></a>I hope that I have been able to clarify that it is not necessary to extend the communication of the constitution and the handbook from &#147;available&#148; to &#147;readily available&#148;, but if I have not convinced the Committee I shall be happy to look at the matter again and come back to it on Report.</p>

The document I have here is useful and it would not cost too much to send it to every household in the country. There could be an edition which informs people where they can see the full handbook and directs them to their nearest public library or wherever else it may be. That would be helpful in letting people know exactly what they can expect from the health service and what duties they have to it. Perhaps the Government will consider that.</p>

I am not sure whether communication of the constitution will be fulfilled through the European health card but I shall be more than happy to look into that. However, I take the point and could not agree more. We have a document which has been well received by patients, by the public and by the staff who work in the NHS.

It is a question of carrying on as we have started in that, if the Government do everything they say they are going to do, that will be great, but we want to make sure that this effort is maintained over the years into the indefinite future.

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000044"></a>Despite the long list of bodies referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, in a previous group of amendments, the NHS remains largely unaccountable to local people, not least because strategic health authorities bear no relation to any other tier of government. Pretty well the only means of accountability lies within local health overview and scrutiny committees. They have the power to scrutinise the operation and planning of local health services, and they can make reports and recommendations on the adequacy of current planning and provision.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000045"></a>Strategic health authorities struggle to achieve the level of interaction and joint agreement with the NHS that perhaps was envisaged for them when they were created. It is relevant to point out that in the research done in 2007 fewer than 10 per cent of non-executive directors of health trusts were local councillors. That is not in itself a bad thing, and we have no desire to return to the old days when local health boards had large numbers of political appointees placed on them. However, it points to a degree of separation between local authority planning and local NHS planning,  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I think will become more noticeable over the coming years. It is something that comes to the fore when resources are scarce.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000046"></a>Why is this important? Not for the first time, politicians of all parties have been coming to a realisation that not just the use of public funds but the way in which public services are designed and implemented locally have an impact on the health of an area, and we are beginning to understand in ever greater detail the effect that environmental decisions can have on the health of a population. The planning of roads and social facilities, the location of schools and access to healthy food within communities are becoming more relevant and important. There should be a greater degree of sharing between the NHS and local authorities if there are to be improved health outcomes for local populations and if health inequalities are to be reduced.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000047"></a>It is perhaps in the realisation that the current system of health overview and scrutiny committees, notwithstanding the time and effort that local authorities put into it, does not work to the satisfaction of everyone and could be a great deal better. At this moment when the Minister has put forward this document, which is I suppose a statement in time with aspirations for the future about how we are to improve the value of the NHS to health within local communities, this requirement to share on a more equal basis with local authorities the mechanisms for accountability should not be overly bureaucratic. People in the NHS should not be fearful of it, it is just one way of being more effective stewards of resources that may not diminish, but will be in increasing demand.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000048"></a>That is why we have tabled this amendment in this way and I hope that the Minister will find it acceptable. I beg to move.</p>

One or two minor political points have been raised from both sides of the Committee and, as a Cross-Bencher, I do not take any political stance, as I am sure the Minister will appreciate.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000050"></a>However, I hark back to when I was a member of the Newcastle Regional Hospital Board in the late 1960s. In 1970 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the board of governors of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, which had direct access to the Ministry of Health, as it then was, gave up its governors&#146; status and a new hospital management committee was created to embrace all the hospitals in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. It was a university hospital management committee made up of one-third university members, one-third health service staff of all grades and one-third from the local community. For three years, from 1971 to 1974, it functioned superbly.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000051"></a>Along came the Conservative Government, with Sir Keith Joseph&#151;later Lord Joseph&#151;as the Secretary of State for Health. On the basis of a report from the management consultancy firm McKinsey, he introduced a system of what he called &#147;consensus management&#148; in the National Health Service. That produced a system of district, area and regional health authorities. Consensus management resulted in a process whereby the decision-making machinery absolutely and totally congealed.  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There was no way of reaching a decision. You had to go through 14 committees if you wished to appoint a new registrar, for example. The system was an unmitigated disaster. We struggled along for a few years&#151;I was dean of a medical school at the time&#151;before, a few years later, the Labour Government came in. Mrs Barbara Castle, later Baroness Castle, was then the Secretary of State for Health. She published a White Paper entitled <I>Democracy in the National Health Service</I>, which doubled the number of local authority members on the health authorities, the result of which&#151;let us not be pejorative about it&#151;was that the local authorities tended to appoint to the health service bodies not the most able and outstanding of local councillors but those for whom they could not find any other job. The result of that was that the decision-making machinery became worse, in that many of the members of the local authorities appointed to those bodies spent most of the time arguing for the health services in their local constituencies and the situation became disastrous.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, who is not here, called for a Royal Commission on the National Health Service. In fact, a Royal Commission was established under the late Sir Alec Merrison and reported in 1980. It at last did something to sort out the appalling administrative mess resulting from those various actions. Since then, the reorganisation of the health service has been so much better, but I merely wish to strike a note of caution. There are now many members of local authorities who are non-executive directors of health bodies of various kinds and make an outstanding contribution, but I want to make it clear that that experience did not enamour me of the idea of major involvement of local authorities in the organisation of the NHS. It is right that they should be involved, but they should not dominate the bodies concerned with NHS delivery.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, was talking about history. I remember chairing social services for a county council; I then became a district and regional health authority chair. In those days, I knew where the overlaps lay. I also knew where the voids between health and social services existed. I liked local government because it had a rigour about it. Knocking on 1,000 doors every four years is very salutary, especially when the resident goes in, reaches behind their clock, takes out your previous election manifesto and quizzes you on the promises that you made and broke.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000055"></a>The NHS lacks that rigour, that local democracy, and so it has to seek other mechanisms. It compensates for it with a whole cat&#146;s cradle of different regulations of targets, accountabilities, standards, carrots and sticks. It needs that to ensure that it performs and that the Government can see where their public money is being spent.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000056"></a>My experience was a long time ago, but at the moment I am dealing weekly with local government and the NHS. I am not sure that an awful lot of

Thirty years ago, I remember, we coined a phrase &#147;a network of care&#148; and professed our intention that needy people be caught by that net so that they would not fall between the two services. I am not sure quite what happened to the net, but I do not think that it really worked. Later on, we talked about a &#147;seamless service&#148;, and we still do. We are anxious that people do not fall between the seams, but I am not sure where that has got us either.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000057"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, we need to strengthen the accountability in the NHS; we need to strengthen joint working with social and social care services. The overview and scrutiny committees have been a brave attempt to do that. From talking to the people who have been before them and who have run them from local government, I believe that in some places they are really working very well. The local authority is thoughtful, knowledgeable and constructive in its criticism of the NHS. In other places, the local authorities have proved to be ill informed, overly political and destructive, and have jeopardised any sort of joint working. But this is early days. We have a lot to learn from each other, to spread good practice.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000058"></a>On commissioning, I think that the NHS has a lot to learn from local government, which embraced commissioning 25 years or so ago. I know that some joint commissioning is being trialled and I hope that will prove to be fruitful. However, I have a bit of a problem with the amendment. Although I absolutely support the intentions behind it, I am not sure about the last part of the amendment where it refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000200"></a>&#147;accountability to the local community through democratically elected councillors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000168"></a>It is the word &#147;through&#148; that could raise a lot of problems. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146; reply to the amendment. I share the sentiment behind it, but it may not be quite the way forward.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000060"></a>On a technical point on the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, the list in Clause 2(2) contains two different sorts of organisations&#151;first, providers of care on either a regional or a local basis and then, at the end, the two regulators, Monitor and the Care Quality Commission. It would be slightly strange if this requirement, which is really about local accountability and the local joining up of services, also caught up the two regulators in the process. That would probably need amendment. The regulatory bodies are established on a national basis to do their task&#151;and it would probably be at odds with the Care Quality Commission&#146;s role in particular in assessing the performance of local authorities on their adult and social care responsibilities.</p>

I hope that the new comprehensive area assessment process will play a role in ensuring that that happens. But on the technical point, I do not think that the two regulators should be caught up with this.</p>

I agree with the sentiment that it is vital for the NHS to engage with its local populations and with its key partners, such as local authorities. However, I do not believe that it is necessary to place such a requirement on the NHS. We have already introduced a comprehensive framework of policies, which I shall go through, to strengthen the accountability of the NHS. This includes giving councils the power to review and scrutinise local health services; introducing foundation trusts, with their membership systems; putting a legal duty on the NHS to involve local people in its decisions about services; and introducing local involvement networks. These reforms are backed up by the world-class commissioning programme, which holds primary care trusts to account for their performance, including how well they engage with their local population.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000063"></a>I distinctly remember the debate on this over the year when we put the constitution together. It is interesting to see my noble friend Lady Jay here, as she was also a member of a think tank as part of the King&#146;s Fund, which was looking at the accountability of the NHS. It debated in significant breadth what the best  model was.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000064"></a>The statement on NHS accountability, which was published alongside the NHS Constitution, shows that there are a number of ways in which PCTs are free to adopt local views, and I shall go through them again. They include: inviting local councillors or mayors on to their boards; increasing the integration of commissioned services through joint planning arrangements&#151;there are numerous examples of joint commissioning; it is working well and we have seen the fruits of it; creating a local membership system; joint appointments of senior executives; formal partnership arrangements; and pooled budgets, which we will talk about in due course.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000065"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, it is also critical that the public know how the NHS is accountable at a local level and how they can get involved in the accountability structure. That is why we set out very clearly some of the mechanisms that I described in the statement of NHS accountability, which, as I said, was published alongside the constitution. This is a public-facing document which explains roles, responsibilities and accountability in the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000066"></a>I think I have demonstrated that there is already an extensive system of local accountability in the NHS, and the NHS is of course always working to improve the way in which it involves local populations and works with local authorities. It is also not the case that the only mechanism for local accountability is through

I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness that over the past year we have worked to improve the framework of accountability and that she is able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I start by assuring the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that it was not my intention in any way to reinvent the horrors of the 1970s, reconstituting effective bodies and replacing them with wholly ineffective ones. I had hoped that we were talking about something that reflected more the lessons of the past 30 years.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000068"></a>I absolutely do not underestimate how difficult it is to get the NHS and social care to work together effectively. Some people in both areas have spent their entire professional lives trying to make that happen with varying degrees of success, and some of them bear the scars. I certainly was not trying to advocate any kind of situation in which local councillors would be allowed to dominate health decisions. That would not be right. However, over the past 30 years we have come to recognise that for effective planning of health and social care services all sorts of people with professional knowledge&#151;and, thinking about housing, in some cases technical knowledge&#151;need to be involved on an equal basis in discussions with the policymakers.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000069"></a>I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, one question, although I do not expect him to come up with an answer instantly. How many PCTs invite councillors to be on their boards? I understand that there are examples of good practice but I should like to know how prevalent it is and how it works to good effect.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000070"></a>I accept some of the criticisms about some of the wording in the amendment. It was not an attempt on our part to say that local councillors are the only mechanism for local accountability; none the less, they are a pretty important one. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, that we have had comprehensive area assessments for a long time and they have included health. These have recognised that we have had a health oversight and scrutiny committee but that it has not worked, so we need to move a bit further. I have long thought that one of the big problems in the NHS is that strategic health authorities do not relate to any other part of Government. Nevertheless, they exist and I accept that there is no appetite whatever anywhere in the NHS for a restructuring; you have to go with the structure as it is.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000071"></a>For all the flaws in the amendment&#146;s wording, I was trying to dig out the fact that where health oversight and scrutiny committees see things going wrong and that the NHS is not having the impact that it should, they do not have a mechanism at the moment to influence strategic health authorities. That is a major gap. If strategic health authorities are to continue to have responsibility for the performance of PCTs, there has to be an alignment with social care.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000072"></a>I take entirely the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that in social services people work to structures and that in the NHS they work to relationships. Happily, sometimes they come together&#151;it

However, for quite a lot of the time it is not.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000073"></a>There is a reason for introducing this provision now. I can remember that slightly more than 10 years ago, when resources were tight, social care and health services used to bat patients back and forward in order not to pick up responsibility for equipment, drugs or care. That kind of thing happens when money is tight. It is not yet tight, but it might be. If we can see a deficit&#151;not in places for people to go and play at being local politicians&#151;in the understanding of users of health and social care services of how the resources are being used in their area, addressing that situation now would be very wise.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000074"></a>I have listened to the Minister and to the comments made by other noble Lords about the deficiency of the wording. I shall take the amendment away but I may wish to return to the issue in some respects. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This group of amendments is on a similar tack. It concerns the list of bodies that are to be consulted when the NHS constitution is revised 10 years hence. There is a presumption that the bodies listed will still be around and functioning, but that may be dreadfully optimistic given the lifespan of some NHS bodies over the past few years. None the less, the amendments in the group highlight the concern shared by noble Lords around the Committee that if the document is to work in the way envisaged by the Minister, it needs to be, if nothing else, a focal point for discussion about how the NHS is working and should work in the future, and a number of people ought to be involved as of right, separately and distinctly, in any revision of it. Carers, for example, should not be swept up in a general category of &#147;the public&#148; because they have a distinct input.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000076"></a>I cannot stress enough that local authorities and representative bodies of local authorities should be involved. We will move to a time when responsibility for health will go well beyond the National Health Service and on to what remains of the public service infrastructure. If this document takes off and becomes the progressive tool that the Minister envisages, then he has nothing to fear in stating publicly now that these groups of people will be involved in its revision as it goes on with its life.

I hope that the Government do not mean this.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000078"></a>We see in Clause 3 that provision is made for the Secretary of State to undertake a consultation before revising the constitution. That is fine until we look a little further on and see how limited is the nature of that consultation. Nowhere is there a mention of carers; patients are mentioned but not bodies representing patients or particular groups of patients; and there is no mention of local involvement networks, the bodies created by the Government only last year to act as local patient watchdogs. I would like to see mention made of bodies that represent staff, such as the BMA, the RCN and the other unions&#151;not just, say, a handful of random NHS employees.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000079"></a>At the end of the consultation exercise, what does the Secretary of State have to do by way of publishing the results of the consultation? Absolutely nothing. He can review and revise the constitution without having to disclose to anyone what feedback he has received, so that it will be impossible for any of us to know to what extent he has taken account of the comments made to him. It is a closed process, and that surely cannot be right.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000080"></a>There are two reasons why that is not satisfactory. The first relates to specialised services, which got a raw deal in the NHS Constitution; they are not even mentioned. There is a paragraph on page 15 of the handbook about the existence of specialised services, but couched in terms that grossly belittle their importance:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000189"></a>&#147;The NHS also provides access to &#145;specialised services&#146; for the small number of people&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09022328000169"></a>the small number of people&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000201"></a>&#147;who suffer from rare conditions. These specialised services are commissioned either regionally or nationally from a few specialist centres, depending on the rarity of the condition or treatment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000170"></a>Given that specialised services account for no less than 10 per cent of the NHS budget and many hundreds of thousands of NHS patients, often in the most extreme need, this seems to be&#151;to put it mildly&#151;inadequate recognition. The constitution itself, not just the handbook, should enshrine the importance of regional and supra-regional services alongside local planning and provision. It is, after all, this combination of local, regional and supra-regional that makes the NHS a truly national service.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000081"></a>The second reason why this part of the Bill is unsatisfactory is the absence of any acknowledgment of patient and public involvement in decision-making. A number of organisations have pointed that out, including the BMA, RADAR and the RCN. Patient and public involvement is mentioned in the constitution, which is well and good, but there is no provision in this clause for involvement by LINks or bodies like the Patients Association in providing feedback on the drafting of what is intended to be a key point of reference for the delivery of health services. It is difficult to involve everyone in a dialogue, but if the Secretary of State were to have an explicit obligation to publish a report setting out the results of the consultation, it  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would at least add a welcome measure of transparency and make consultees feel that their representations had been factored in.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000082"></a>One group that feels short-changed is the disabled. RADAR has made clear its disappointment that the opportunity was not seized during the drafting of the constitution to highlight the full nature of existing rights under the Disability Discrimination Act in relation to equality of access to health services and to treatment. Neither the constitution nor the handbook refers explicitly to the right to reasonable adjustments for disabled people, which is a key provision of the DDA. All that the documents mention is the right not to be treated less favourably on various grounds, which is not at all the same thing. It would have been very helpful if, at the very least, the handbook could have given clear information about the statutory duties that exist to promote disability, race and gender equality. We know that there are large inequalities in access to primary care on the part of people with mental health problems and people with learning disabilities. A reminder to PCTs about the need to tackle those would not have gone amiss.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000083"></a>I shall say a brief word about carers. Carers engage with the NHS in a completely different way from either patients or ordinary members of the public. Very often, it is carers who facilitate access to services on behalf of the patients they look after, and their own lives are almost as much affected by the quality of those services as those who are in receipt of them. As a result, they bring a different perspective on how well or how badly the NHS is meeting patients&#146; needs. As the Minister will know, that valuable difference is recognised in other contexts, where health bodies are required to consult and involve carers. The NHS operating framework for 2009<b>-</b>10 says that PCTs must devise<b></b>joint plans with local authorities to provide carers with breaks. The Putting People First concordat between the NHS and local government recognises that family members and carers are to be treated as experts and partners in the delivery of care. There is a strong case for seeking the views of carers whenever the NHS constitution is being reviewed or revised. I should add that I am very much in support of Amendment 31 of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, which says that the three-yearly report on the practical effect of the constitution should include a report on how it has affected carers.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000084"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09022328000245"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> Your Lordships will not be surprised that I rise to speak in support of the amendments about carers&#151;that is, Amendments 16, 20 and 31. Not including carers in this matter is a missed opportunity. That is strange for this Government, who have an exemplary record as far as carers are concerned, which I acknowledge. I declare an interest as vice-president of Carers UK and president of Eurocarers. In those roles, I am well aware that what this Government have done for carers is the envy of the world. We have only to look at the national strategy, the Standing Commission on Carers, Acts of Parliament and the kind of regulations and encouragements which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has already mentioned to us. It is a missed opportunity if we do not mention them specifically in this regard.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000085"></a>One of the problems with which the Minister may be wrestling is the dual role that carers play, because they first of all are patients of the NHS in their own right and have rights in that respect. We should remember that three-quarters of all carers&#151;there are 6 million of them, as I do not need to remind your Lordships&#151;report that their own health, physical, emotional or mental, is adversely affected by the caring role. So they have great needs as patients. However, they then have a second role as suppliers of care. Healthcare does not take place in a vacuum; nor does it take place in hospitals or surgeries, as we might be forgiven for thinking if we listen to some of the debates in your Lordships' House. Healthcare takes place largely in your own home, provided by yourself and your family and to the value of &#163;87 billion, which is very nearly the cost of another health service.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000086"></a>So carers play sometimes confusing roles which are often even in conflict. I make no apology for reminding Members of the Committee of the case that I quoted at Second Reading of the woman who had bowel cancer several years ago. The NHS provides her with excellent follow-up care, which requires her to have a colonoscopy every year. As someone who has that treatment, I know that it lays you out for a couple of days. This woman cannot take that opportunity because she cannot find anyone to care for her husband while she has the treatment.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000087"></a>We need to take very careful account of those kinds of conflicts when we consider carers. Not including them in consultation denies them an opportunity to consider their role, not only as patients in terms of what they need but in terms of what they can contribute. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that they cannot just be regarded as being in that catch-all term, &#147;the public&#148;. It is logical, consistent and desirable to include carers and I hope that the Minister will do so.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000088"></a>I support what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said about specialist services. I speak in my role as chair of the Specialised Healthcare Alliance. These services may not be known to many people in healthcare but they constitute 10 per cent of what the health service provides and, as the noble Earl reminded us, often serve people in very great need. We have to think about specialised services as well in this context.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000089"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09022328000246"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I am, as ever, somewhat confused and find it difficult to understand why a Labour Government have trouble on occasions in using the words &#147;trade unions&#148; in legislation. A number of pieces of legislation have gone through Parliament in recent years which refer to &#147;staff&#148;, but we are never absolutely specific. I am not saying that we should identify any particular trade union, but we should be a little more adventurous in the language we use. There is a generic heading, &#147;staff&#148;, in Clause 3(5)(b), whereas in Clause 2(2), paragraphs (a) to (g), there are listed,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000190"></a>&#147;Strategic Health Authorities ... Primary Care Trusts ... National Health Service trusts ... Special Health Authorities ... NHS foundation trusts ... the Independent Regulator ... the Care Quality Commission&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000171"></a>Those are specific areas of managerial operation and administration, but trade unions are not included.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000090"></a>My Amendment 18 would include in this process of consultation trade unions and professional organisations representing staff. I propose the amendment following my usual discussions on this Bill and similar Bills with UNISON, a trade union with which I have quite a lot of contact but no pecuniary or financial relationship whatever. I should make that absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000091"></a>UNISON, which was formed from three trade unions, NALGO, NUPE and the Confederation of Health Service Employees, will be in the front line in implementing many areas of this legislation. I should have thought that Ministers would have had immediately in mind the need to consult trade unions, particularly in this area of the Bill which deals with the review of the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000092"></a>UNISON supports the introduction of the constitution and believes that it will help enshrine and protect the NHS&#146;s vital core principles and responsibilities. The union welcomes measures in the Bill that ensure that every organisation and staff member working within or on behalf of the NHS will have to adhere to the constitution and its accompanying handbook. Ideally, UNISON would want implementation of the constitution to be covered in the contractual relationships that the private sector has with the National Health Service. It is vital, in the union&#146;s view, that the Bill covers all models of provision. It emphasises that a two-tier adherence to the NHS Constitution and handbook must not be possible, now or in the future in particular.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000093"></a>The union agrees that the constitution must remain a relevant document but that it is right that the main reviews take place only once every 10 years. It believes that this will help to focus the constitution on long-term priorities and ensure that it remains above shorter term political debates. The union welcomes the specific naming of staff as a statutory consultee for any changes. However, it would like assurances that employee representative organisations, such as itself and including trade unions, will be specifically consulted as part of any review process.</p>
<h5><a name="09022328000215"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000094"></a>The union believes that revisions to the handbook should focus only on the technical detail necessary to make sure that the rights outlined in the constitution reflect the most recent legislative terminology and organisational forms and not other matters. The more aspirational pledges within the constitution should be revisited only in the 10-year review envisaged for the actual constitution. While not wanting to make the handbook review process too cumbersome, it would like assurances that key stakeholders, including staff and patients&#151;I do not like the word &#147;stakeholders&#148; but I am using it today&#151;are involved with proposed revisions to the NHS handbook if they go any further than technical amendments.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000095"></a>On Second Reading, my noble friend gave some assurances that such organisations would be consulted with. However, the union would be keen to see these assurances in the Bill. They should be, and we should not duck what I believe is a Labour Government responsibility.</p>

Critical to the success of the NHS Constitution is to recognise how people perceive it, use it and, indeed, how the staff wish to work in it. After 10 years we really should have some sort of an indication about how effective it is. Therefore, I am very pleased that the Government will consult when undertaking this 10-year review.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000097"></a>I want to say a few words about consultation. Years ago it was highly valued, but it has always been used as a proxy for giving people some influence over policy in a huge and centralised monopoly-run service. That is one of the ways that we can try to get people to have some influence. Over the years, we have consulted on so much that it is losing some of its force. Indeed, some people today tell me that they have consultation fatigue as they are consulted on nearly everything that comes out. Certainly, it is often thought that it is a piece of bureaucracy that the NHS has to go through. Local organisations perceive that the decisions have already been taken and that this is just some exercise that takes three months and has to be gone through.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000098"></a>In the commercial world, as a customer you can usually walk away and find another provider, be it a supermarket or a private healthcare provider if you can afford it. The business soon knows whether its product is valued. It has to balance the books. If it does not, the business simply goes out of business.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000099"></a>The user has little influence in the current NHS. Consultation seems to be the only tool to involve people in policy decisions. In time, perhaps direct payments, which we shall discuss later, will make a difference. Until direct payments are established and we see the result of them, we have to fall back on this rather barren process of consultation.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000100"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will say to me, &#147;Hang on a minute&#148;; when he was drawing up his document <I>High Quality Care for All</I>, he took enormous trouble to consult widely. Moreover, he set up structures across every NHS region in the country to get the views that were incorporated into the overall policy. I read in the Second Reading debate that the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, said how much pleasure working with some of these groups gave her. I have heard other staff say that they felt it was a valuable exercise. It was a massive exercise. It was very well thought out and structured, and it was expensive in time and money, but it was effective because the noble Lord listened and acted on the views expressed. Of course, the views were not unanimous, but they never are when you go out to consultation.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000101"></a>I am saying not that consultation never works but that it does not work very often, and that is particularly true when it comes to fraught issues such as closing local services. I think that the time has come when we have to seek some alternative methods of empowering patients and the public, but at the moment we have to go with what is on offer.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000102"></a>Although I have enormous sympathy with a number of the bodies suggested in the amendments, I attach my name particularly to carers, principally because I am working with carers and because I am one myself.

<p><a name="09022328000103"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, mentioned the 6 million or so who literally give their lives for years on end to care for someone else, and often it is not a choice but a duty. They are the heroes of our society and we should give them all the help that we can. Knowing their rights as set out in the constitution will, I think, help. In 10 years&#146; time the world will be different and their input in revising the constitution will be of considerable value. They have first-hand knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the NHS and they should be listened to.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000104"></a>In recent years, we have included the word &#147;public&#148; when talking about patients&#151;patient and public involvement, or PPI. It may have been the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, who said that when this is mentioned it is usually followed by the plaintive little cry, &#147;How about the carers?&#148;. Could we adopt the phrase &#147;patient, public and carer involvement&#148;, or PPCI, as part of our regular terminology? That seems to me to be very simple. Words are important. They frame a mindset, and PPCI would become as natural to us as PPI. It would ensure that carers were always included, as they are not patients. Some are patients in their own right but, in this context, they are people who care for others and are not mere members of the public. I think they should have a distinct status in our society and in the legislation that we draw up.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000105"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022328000248"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> This is an exceptionally difficult and complex issue. It is clear that in relation to any review of the NHS Constitution local authorities must be consulted. All noble Lords who have contributed to the debate on this group of amendments have spoken very persuasively and with expertise based on their personal experience. Plainly, it is important that carers should be consulted as well as trade unions and professional organisations representing staff, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said. Clearly, all these individuals have an abiding interest in the National Health Service, in the constitution and in any revision that may be developed in future.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000106"></a>Incidentally, the noble Earl referred to the BMA. It is not widely known that the BMA is a registered trade union, although it is not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. The BMA and the Royal College of Nursing might be included but what about physiotherapists, occupational therapists, medical technologists and clinical psychologists? In the light of what we said about the crucial importance of the NHS in relation to educational issues and research, what about the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Medical Research Council, the General Medical Council, the bodies concerned with the education of nurses and the Health Professions Council? One could go on and on. We are in serious danger of going back to the question of developing a list.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000107"></a>I sympathise with the Minister about the challenge with which he is faced. These are very important issues and the organisations referred to are vital to the future  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the National Health Service, but how can the Government find inclusive terms which embrace the necessity to consult all these bodies? It is a very difficult issue. These are all very worthy amendments but, as they stand, they would exclude the possibility of consulting a large number of other organisations which also need to be consulted. Happily, there is a phrase about other organisations that the Secretary of State may prescribe. That is a very important part of this exercise. But I believe that the Minister has a very difficult task in making these amendments inclusive but not at the same time too prescriptive in excluding many other bodies which are vital to the future of the NHS and require to be consulted.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000108"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09022328000249"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> My friend the noble Lord, Lord Walton, is as usual highly eloquent but, as it is, we already have a list. The list is here. Many of us would make a particular plea for one specific set of amendments&#151;Amendments 16, 20 and 31&#151;about carers. We make that plea partly because this Government have done so much to ensure that carers are now seen but also because of the particular role that carers play in supporting the health service. I speak as someone who previously might have thought that I know what other members of the public might have done, despite having had elderly parents and all the care that goes on through life. However, recently I became the carer of a cousin with Alzheimer&#146;s in Sheffield, and am trying to find my way through an extraordinary maze of health and social care, by which even my expertise is totally defeated.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000109"></a>Carers carrying out those sorts of tasks, with that sort of experience, should be consulted because they have a relevant, direct insight into what works and what does not work. That is particularly the case with some of the things that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, was saying earlier&#151;how social care and health care fit together. Unless we have carers in this list, they may well be seen as ordinary members of the public. I feel very different as an ordinary member of the public who happens to be linked to St Thomas&#146; Hospital through the LINks programme, because I am a user of St Thomas&#146; Hospital, from how I feel as a carer trying to find my way through the maze of the services 200 miles away from someone over whom I now have lasting power of attorney, his wife having died and since he has no other immediate relative.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000110"></a>I support what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said about specialist services. I alluded to that briefly early on in these debates, because those services often get forgotten. I declare an interest as the patron and trustee of an organisation called Little Hearts Matter, which deals with children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and other &#147;half a heart&#148;- type difficulties. Those specialist services are utterly crucial, not only to the well-being of those children but to their very lives, with the oldest being only 18 and all children before that having died. Unless those specialist services are properly consulted and properly represented, those families will find that they do not have the kind of services in which they can have confidence. They do not want it next door; they want the kind of service that will meet their needs.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000111"></a>With all the understanding about lists&#151;and I have views about that&#151;I think that carers are an exception. Somehow we must ensure that specialist services are properly consulted.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000112"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022328000250"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I very much support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on specialised services. I declare an interest as someone with a spinal injury. I have Amendment 126, which relates to services for spinal injury patients, which are in an absolute crisis situation at the moment because there are not enough beds. The specialised services include those with rare conditions, and there are many of them. There are rare cancers, rare neurological conditions, rare heart conditions, rare muscular conditions and rare conditions in children&#151;and there are many others. They sometimes have to travel for miles to get the services they need. Many of them are on orphan drugs.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000113"></a>All this can deal with the commissioning of services, which is becoming exceedingly difficult. For example, some of these patients have a problem with borders. A patient who lived in Wales, one mile from the orthopaedic hospital in Oswestry, was not allowed to be sent there; he had to go to Cardiff. Think of the effect of that on his family, travelling down to Cardiff. That is an example of the unnecessary difficulties they face.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000114"></a>I hope that the Minister, with all his experience, will look at this. It entails NICE, orphan drugs and specialised services. It is very important. And, of course, I support our carers; as has been said, they are vital.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000116"></a>I also support the points made about carers by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. I know that when I have complications due to my spinal cord injury, it is my partner who then becomes my carer and is even more dependent on the quality of the health services than I am at that point. I hope my noble friend the Minister will be able to respond encouragingly to the points that have been made.</p>

Amendments 15 to 21 all propose that particular groups must be consulted during each 10-year review of the constitution. Amendment 31 proposes that the Secretary of State&#146;s three-yearly report on the effect of the constitution considers the effect on carers in addition to patients, staff and members of the public. Amendment 14 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to publish a report on the results of future consultations on any revision of the NHS Constitution. I understand the intention behind these amendments but it is important to give some context for the current intention as it is set out in the Bill, and to explain that each of these groups is captured in the current drafting of Clause 3.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000118"></a>Amendment 13, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, proposes that local authorities be specifically consulted on any revision of the constitution. I shall clarify the purpose of the interim revisions to the constitution to reassure the noble Baronesses that those who are affected by any revision will indeed be consulted.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000119"></a>The constitution is intended to be an enduring document, and any substantial changes should be made as part of the 10-year review. However, it is possible that changes in law or departmental policy will cause parts of the constitution to become out of date. We do not believe that it would be right to wait until the next 10-year review before making such relatively minor revisions, which is why we have made provision in the legislation for the Secretary of State to revise the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000120"></a>Clause 3(3) ensures that the Secretary of State will be under an obligation to consult those who would be affected by any revision. He must consult,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000202"></a>&#147;other persons as appear to the Secretary of State to be affected by the proposed revision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000172"></a>That would include local authorities, where they are affected. We have deliberately chosen not to specify which bodies must be consulted on revisions to the constitution, as there may be some revisions that are not relevant to them. We do not believe that it would be logical to impose a legal obligation on the Secretary of State to consult specific bodies if the proposed revision did not affect them in any way. However, I reassure the Committee again that where a revision affects certain bodies, it is fully our intent to consult them.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000121"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09022328000253"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> My noble friend says that it is not specific in the sense of identifying individual bodies. However, Clause 3(5)(d) states,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000203"></a>&#147;the bodies and persons listed in section 2(2)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000173"></a>Seven of them are then laid out. So it is specific and identifies individual organisations, some of which may not be affected by any particular proposed amendment or revision.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000122"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09022328000254"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I am referring to revision of the constitution, which could happen much sooner than in 10 years, rather than the constitution itself. I am talking about minor revisions and changes in policy that may be necessary and about how we consult in relation to them. I will come back to the issue of the 10-year review of the constitution. I agree, though, that local authorities have been, and will remain, a vital group in shaping the constitution or any future changes.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000123"></a>Amendments 15 and 17, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, would add to the subsection that requires patients to be consulted on the 10-year review of the constitution the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000204"></a>&#147;including such bodies representing patients as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000174"></a>and, to the subsection requiring staff to be consulted, the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000205"></a>&#147;including such bodies representing staff as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09022328000175"></a>Similarly, Amendment 18, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, proposes that trade unions and professional organisations representing staff are consulted. This makes a reference to the 10-year review. I reassure the Committee that bodies representing patients and staff, including trade unions and professional bodies, have been throughout the past 18 months, and will remain, a vital group in shaping the constitution and any future changes.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000124"></a>Many patient groups, including the Patients Forum, contributed to the production of the final NHS Constitution, as did many bodies representing staff, such as the NHS Confederation and Unison, as my noble friend pointed out. I am pleased that the chair of the Patients Forum, Sally Brearley, believes that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000191"></a>&#147;The NHS Constitution is a very valuable re-affirmation of the principles and values of the NHS ... It demonstrates the commitment of Government to the NHS, and of the NHS to its patients&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000176"></a>Similarly, the Head of Health at UNISON, Karen Jennings, has declared that the constitution,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000206"></a>&#147;is a vision of which Nye Bevan could be proud&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000125"></a>Our intention is to continue to work with as many bodies representing patients and staff as possible in the 10-yearly review of the constitution in any more minor revisions where they are affected and, more broadly, in ensuring that the constitution has a real impact. However, we believe that the legislation already captures these bodies in the 10-year review: Clause 3(5) sets out the duty to consult, among others, patients, staff and,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000207"></a>&#147;such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09022328000177"></a>That could include the bodies representing patients and staff; indeed, I can put on the record our intention that such bodies will be consulted on any 10-year review of the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000126"></a>I turn to carers. Amendments 16 and 20, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, propose that carers must be specifically consulted on the 10-year review of the constitution, a point made strongly by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. Again, I reassure the Committee that we recognise the importance of the role of carers in the NHS and the importance of carers being an integral part of the constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000127"></a>Indeed, noble Lords will be aware that one of the core principles of the constitution states that NHS services must reflect the needs and preferences of patients, their families and their carers. I am pleased that Carers UK, which we have already mentioned, was able to support the introduction of the constitution, saying that the new NHS Constitution gives carers,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000208"></a>&#147;prominence as partners in care. We welcome this as the beginning of a culture change in the NHS towards valuing the extraordinary caring contribution of ordinary people.&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="09022328000178"></a>The Government&#146;s intention is that when the constitution is reviewed in 10 years, carers will be included in the consultations. It is also the Government&#146;s intention that carers should be consulted on those affected by more minor revisions of the NHS constitution. As drafted, Clause 3(3) and 3(5) refers to the need to consult members of the public and it was our intention  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that carers would be part of that. But I have listened; I will take into account what has been said and come back at a later stage having looked at the issue more specifically.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000128"></a>Amendment 19 proposes that local involvement networks, or LINks, be consulted on the 10-year review of the constitution. Again, the Government recognise the valuable part that LINks played in shaping the constitution that is now before the Committee. Many LINks across England contributed to the consultation process, including those at Gateshead, Hull, Gloucestershire and Sandwell. Again, it is our intention to continue consulting local involvement networks on relevant matters when reviewing the constitution or when the constitution is reviewed in 10 years&#146; time.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000129"></a>In Amendment 21, the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, propose that local authorities be consulted on the 10-yearly review of the NHS Constitution. Again we understand the importance of joined-up care and we believe that local authorities have already been captured. I am sorry this goes on; this involves each contributor based on the long list eloquently put by the noble Lord, Lord Walton.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000130"></a>I can reassure the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that producing a report on the result of the constitution, as proposed in Amendment 14, is a standard government practice. For this reason, the amendment is unnecessary. I return to the Government&#146;s code of practice on consultation which sets out that, following a consultation exercise, a summary of any significant comment should be provided. This feedback should normally set out what decisions have been taken in the light of what was learnt from the consultation exercise. This information should normally be published before or alongside any further action. I can put on record that the Department of Health has every intention of complying with this code of practice when it consults on revisions of the NHS Constitution. Indeed, it has produced a written response to last year&#146;s consultation on the draft constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000131"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, was very kind in relation to the consultation exercise that the next stage review went through. I agree that some have a cynical view about consultations, mostly clinical consultations, which they say bring groups of clinicians together to come up with the answer that we want. Far from it. The next stage review engaged more than 2,000 clinicians, most of whom felt empowered by the consultation, and what is in front of the Committee in <I>High Quality Care for All</I> is, more or less, the policies that we captured through consulting with clinicians. What we have done in the constitution is based very much on similar principles.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000132"></a>I hope that I have been able to clarify why it will not be necessary to extend the list of persons or bodies to be consulted every 10 years. However, I have some sympathy with the persuasive arguments that noble Lords have put forward for recognising certain persons or bodies explicitly. I am more than happy to discuss these in greater detail&#151;carers specifically&#151;and some other groups that have been pointed out in this important debate. I shall look again at the drafting of the clause to ensure that the balance is right in relation to the 10-year review and the report, keeping in mind the

In giving these commitments to look at the issue again and at the relevant parts of subsections (3) and (5), I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000136"></a>I thank noble Lords for their contributions. This group of amendments has answered for me what I might call Lord Walton&#146;s question: if there is to be a list, who should be on it? I come back to what I think is the answer to that. It was enormously helpful to have explained the distinction between small revisions to be carried out periodically and the process of the 10-year review. The Minister&#146;s general commitment to the inclusion of a wide range of stakeholders, to use the jargon, was welcome. The success of this document, once it is launched, does not rest solely with the NHS. It cannot; the NHS cannot implement it all&#151;it has to be done in conjunction with others. There was recognition of that in what the Minister said.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000137"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I say, &#147;Hold on&#148;. At the rate they are nationalising banks, the noble Lord may yet see a piece of legislation containing the words &#147;trade unions&#148;, so he should not give up. Just persist.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000138"></a>It was important to have the discussion about specialised services. There is always a legitimate concern that those who have specialised conditions tend to be pushed out of the picture by those who have conditions that are more prevalent and therefore tend to be far higher up the political list.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000139"></a>We may have teased out one thing in the discussion. There is a case for putting carers into this. That point was made principally by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, who talked about the fact that her partner became her carer at a particular point. The question of who is a carer and who is not changes over time. That is one thing. The second thing is that in the NHS, and increasingly in social care, there is a more coherent  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and consistent view of users and the rights of users. The distinction is that in the NHS it is more likely that practitioners will see users without their carers being present and will therefore be less likely to feel comfortable with breaking clinical confidentiality. Therefore, with all the best will in the world, carers in the NHS are in a slightly different position from those in social care. That is not to say that there is bad practice in social care&#151;there is not&#151;but there is a recognition in social care that the majority of the work is done by informal carers and that they have to be involved in their own right much more so than in the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000140"></a>For those two reasons, it was very good that we drew out why carers have to be mentioned distinctly. Nobody wants the review of the constitution to become a cumbersome exercise, but we want it to be valid and to throw out valid results and challenges to the NHS every 10 years. That would be a very useful thing to do. With those caveats, I welcome the Minister&#146;s agreement that he will take away part of our discussion and perhaps refer to it at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I apologise for the deficiencies in the drafting. The amendment goes in part to the ground that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, opened up for us in a previous debate. The review of the constitution is laid out before us as a process or mechanism. There is not a great deal about the substance and objective of such a review. It is self-evident that it will be a process that is gone through to try to determine the extent to which those principles have been upheld. As somebody who, at least in part, makes their living from helping organisations to do evaluation processes, I could go on for some considerable time about how you evaluate principles. I am afraid that these days I charge a fee for that, so I will not.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000142"></a>It is right for us to probe what the outcome of the review is meant to be. It is also right that we should identify this one particular area&#151;that is, the review taking into account the extent to which the NHS Constitution has played a role in bringing together health and social care. I have a particular reason for saying that. It is possible that the NHS could achieve the aspirations, aims and goals that are set out in the constitution and handbook. It could do so at the expense of social care and it could do so at the expense of the resources that are devoted to social care. One fundamentally important part of this will be to evaluate the NHS on the extent to which it, in conjunction with

Therefore, it is worth probing in the amendment&#151;we know a bit about the process&#151;what the intended outcome is going to be, and the extent to which this constitution and its implementation might act as a magnet for resources drawn from other areas of public services. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000143"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09022328000260"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> Amendment 22 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to take into account any impact on bringing together health and social care when conducting any review of the NHS Constitution.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000144"></a>I think that it would be helpful if I first give some context around the proposals for the review of the constitution. As we have said previously, the intention behind the 10-year review is to keep it up to date and to ensure that it remains fit for purpose. It is a way of ensuring that, while remaining an enduring document, the constitution can keep up with changes in policy and the law and with people&#146;s changing expectations of the NHS.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000145"></a>We have not sought to specify in the Bill particular areas that the review should take into account over and above others, nor do I think that it would be appropriate to do so. I appreciate, however, that the noble Baronesses, Lady Tonge and Lady Barker, were concerned at Second Reading that the NHS Constitution did not give enough attention to the interface between the NHS and social care. I should like to reassure her on two counts. First, of course it remains the Government&#146;s priority that the NHS and social care systems should work together as seamlessly as possible. For example, following <I>High Quality Care for All</I>, we are piloting new models of integrated care provision and looking at innovative ways of improving the interface between health and social care systems. Secondly, although the NHS Constitution is a constitution for the NHS and not for social care, it highlights throughout the importance of joined-up services. For example, one of the seven principles is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000194"></a>&#147;The NHS works across organisational boundaries and in partnership with other organisations in the interest of patients, local communities and the wider population&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000179"></a>The principle goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022328000195"></a>&#147;The NHS is committed to working jointly with local authorities and a wide range of other private, public and third sector organisations at national and local level to provide and deliver improvements in health and well-being&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000180"></a>The NHS Constitution also contains a pledge on the part of the NHS to make the transition as smooth as possible when patients are referred between services. This is particularly relevant to transitions between health and social care services.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000146"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that Clause 5 would require the Secretary of State to report on the effect of the constitution every three years. Such a report would of course look at partnerships and at working across organisational boundaries, given that these are such important themes in the NHS Constitution. The other issue is whether there should be a social care constitution. One is not planned but we are about to launch a Green Paper on social care and I have no doubt that that will be debated in due course.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000147"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness sufficiently on this matter for her to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09022328000148"></a><b><a name="90223-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09022328000261"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I thank the Minister very much for that reply. It is worth bringing to mind that a year ago noble Lords&#151;many of whom are here today&#151;queued up in this Room to take part in the Government&#146;s plans for the CQC. It was debated in great detail because there was concern that there would be an imbalance in the regulatory body as between health and social care. We may have been paranoid then and we may be now because we continue to be concerned about the extent to which health and social care are not equal partners on the ground. However, I do not think that we are paranoid. The Wanless report set out how important it is for the NHS to be fully engaged with social care planning systems so that the preventive agenda can be built up and the NHS does not become a body which stacks up acute needs for the future. That is the important point.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000149"></a>I am intrigued by the idea of a social care constitution. I shall save my detailed views for when we come to debate the Green Paper but I think that it would be miraculous to draw up a constitution when there is no political or social agreement about what social care levels of entitlement are or how they should be funded. However, one should never rule out what one does not know.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000150"></a>For the moment, I shall withdraw the amendment. However, if only one thing were to be prescribed as an output for this review process, it should be the NHS Constitution because it is of such fundamental importance to health, health promotion and the prevention of ill health. However, due to the lateness of the hour, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000152"></a>This is not just an academic objection. In the end, what it means is that the rights of patients and staff in the NHS are whatever the Secretary of State says they are, not what Parliament says they should be. In this sense, Parliament is being asked to sign a blank cheque to Ministers, whether of this Government or of a future Government. Bearing in mind how seminal a document and how far reaching in its effects the constitution is meant to be, I find that troubling and difficult to accept. The Minister may reply that the  


<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>23 Feb 2009 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament in all that he does, which is certainly true. I accept&#151;how could I not?&#151;that it would be completely impossible for a Secretary of State to refer to Parliament before implementing each and every executive decision that he takes. He has to be allowed to get on with his job.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000153"></a>However, the constitution is different from an ordinary executive ministerial decision. It is meant to underpin for the long term everything that the NHS does and a great deal of what Ministers are able to do or not to do. With each right that the constitution defines or creates, it shapes ipso facto future health policy. Are these not matters which Parliament should be given an automatic opportunity to scrutinise? One has only to think of the right to choice that the constitution enshrines for the very first time to appreciate that these are in no sense trivial matters for health policy. However, according to the Bill, Parliament is out of the frame as regards approving the document.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000154"></a>The Government have published a separate statement of NHS accountability which makes considerable play of the fact that Ministers are accountable to Parliament. The <I>NHS Constitution</I> itself states, near the beginning, as part of the seventh key principle that,</p>
<ul><a name="09022328000197"></a>&#147;it is the Government which sets the framework for the NHS and which is accountable to Parliament for its operation&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000155"></a>That is true up to a point, yes, but surely not totally. We do not say that it is up to the Government to set the framework for the NHS in any way that they want. They cannot, for example, invent foundation trusts or abolish a health regulator without first obtaining the approval of Parliament. Parliament has a role in defining the framework for the NHS. Equally, some ministerial decisions have to come before Parliament in the form of a statutory instrument and cannot become law unless and until Parliament has signified its approval or absence of disapproval.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000156"></a>The question for us is whether the NHS Constitution is of a kind which merits some form of nod to the sovereignty Parliament or whether it is not. I have to say that I think it is. The Minister has previously argued that he does not believe it is appropriate to include any element of the NHS Constitution in the Bill. We can continue to discuss that. However, the amendment proposes something much more modest. It is merely saying that once the constitution has been revised, a copy of it should be placed before Parliament. That duty of placing it before Parliament ties in the legislature, even if only in a loose way, to the content of the constitution. I do not think that this is a great deal to ask. I beg to move.</p>

I should remind Members of the Committee that most of the rights in the constitution are already enshrined in law, with the exception of the three new rights that we debated at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000159"></a>The Government would always expect to make a document of such importance available to parliamentarians, usually by placing a copy in the Library and issuing a Written Ministerial Statement. Indeed, Ministers are bound by the <I>Ministerial Code </I>to make important announcements such as this to Parliament.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000160"></a>The noble Earl will of course be aware that when the constitution was published on 21 January it was accompanied by a Written Ministerial Statement and copies were placed in the Library. I do not consider that it is necessary to lay before Parliament future versions of the Act paper rather than place them in the Library.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000161"></a>Furthermore, the constitution is intended to be a public-facing document, unlike annual reports or accounts of non-departmental public bodies, which are often laid as Act papers. Indeed, the constitution is a living, although enduring, document, which will be updated over time. We need the flexibility to alter it, and the current arrangements allow us that flexibility while giving Parliament proper sight of the document. There is no question of the constitution being changed by the back door, given our commitment to consult on any revisions, as we debated earlier.</p>

<a name="90223-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022328000162"></a>Given my reassurances that we have every intention to follow parliamentary procedures, I hope that the noble Earl feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I acknowledge of course that a Written Statement was made to Parliament when the present constitution was signed. I shall consider carefully what he said and whether it is sufficient for the purposes of this Committee. I was grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for the amendment. The amendment may be unnecessary in the light of what the Minister said. I shall take advice on that point. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="09022319000125"></a>On 18 November, an historic agreement was announced by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister setting out a process which would pave the way to the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a><a name="09022319000126"></a>The agreement and the subsequent report of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee on the modalities of devolution contained a number of significant decisions on the shape of the post-devolution framework for the administration of policing and justice in Northern Ireland.</p>

This will enable the Assembly to give effect to the recommendation of the AERC report that a department with policing and justice functions should be established as an additional department to the existing departments which make up the Northern Ireland Executive. The Assembly is currently prevented from establishing an additional department by Section 17 of the Northern Ireland Act, which limits the number of ministerial offices to 10.</p>

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_128"></a><a name="09022319000136"></a>I am today placing in the House Library two reports, published on Monday 16 February 2009, which form an important part of our overall approach to removing unnecessary bureaucracy in policing. These are <I>Reducing the Data Burden on Police Forces in England and Wales</I> by Sir David Normington, the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, and the interim report by Jan Berry, the new independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate, entitled <I>Reducing Bureaucracy in Policing</I>.</p>

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_129"></a><a name="09022319000137"></a>On the same day, the Home Secretary announced the next step in common-sense policing by scrapping a police timesheet, freeing up an estimated 260,000 police hours to focus on cutting crime and driving up public confidence. Police officers will no longer have to complete an annual analysis form accounting for their activity&#151;a step which alone frees up approximately 150 extra officers and staff.</p>

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="09022319000138"></a>Both these documents form part of our overall approach to reducing the burdens placed on police forces and reforming processes to free up officers to deal with the issues that matter to people. The Government have rightly committed themselves to freeing up police time to work with communities to tackle the issues that matter to local people. This involves cutting red tape and dramatically reducing administrative tasks which can take up so much time, including the collection of data by the Home Office and others. This agenda

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="09022319000139"></a>The Green Paper set out a clear commitment to reduce the data collection burden placed on police forces in England and Wales and Sir David Normington&#146;s review sets out how the Green Paper&#146;s commitment to reduce by up to 50 per cent the amount of data collected by the Home Office is to be achieved.</p>

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="09022319000140"></a>His review contains a number of important proposals, most of which can be implemented in the short term, for:</p>
cutting out altogether or significantly reducing 36 data streams; ending activity based costing, which alone will free up an estimated 260,000 police hours; a reduction in ad hoc data requests from the Home Office; a two-year moratorium on requests for new data collection; and a &#147;gateway&#148; process to limit requests which fall outside the annual data requirement.
<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_133"></a><a name="09022319000141"></a>A new data hub will further reduce the burden on police forces, dispensing with 40 per cent of data requests from the Home Office. Taken together these measures will significantly reduce the central data burden imposed by the Home Office and its agencies.</p>

<a name="90223-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="09022319000142"></a>The Home Office is also streamlining the performance management arrangements for police forces by removing police targets and replacing them with a new single top-down target on confidence. We are also continuing to invest in technology to allow officers to spend more time on patrol. We have now committed &#163;80 million to delivering an ambitious target to put in place 30,000 mobile data devices by March 2010, and the second round of funding awards were announced on 29 December 2008. The delivery of these mobile devices to the front line will save an individual police officer up to 30 minutes per shift.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="09022319000143"></a>We also used last year&#146;s Green Paper to respond to the recommendations made by Sir Ronnie Flanagan in his hugely important <I>Review of Policing</I>. It is now almost one year on from the publication of Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s recommendations and we have made considerable progress in implementing them. Nineteen of his 59 recommendations have already been implemented and the remaining are well on track to be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="09022319000144"></a>One of the most significant changes we have made is allowing forces to scrap the stop and account form, which if implemented by all forces could save the service up to 690,000 hours each year.</p>

support for scrapping time-sheets for police officers;reviewing working practices within forces to simplify processes;making more use of technology to free up officer time and maximising the use of existing airwave equipment; andreviewing charging practices to reduce unnecessary burdens on officers and help them to use their discretion more.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_140"></a><a name="09022319000148"></a>Supported by a practitioner group made up of police officers and staff, Jan Berry is also looking in detail at the bureaucracy involved in 10 time-consuming policing processes in order to identify where further savings can be made.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_141"></a><a name="09022319000149"></a>There is more to be done, within both the police service and the Home Office, and we all must actively encourage police forces to share good practice and work collaboratively to adopt measures to reduce bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_171"></a><a name="09022319000182"></a>I wish to announce that we will be consulting on proposed amendments to the Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Regulations 1997.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_172"></a><a name="09022319000183"></a>On current projections, the General Lighthouse Fund will incur an estimated funding shortfall next year of around &#163;21 million. Recent falls in the investment portfolio of the General Lighthouse Fund have reduced the capacity of the fund to defer or spread these increases in dues, which are being kept to the minimum necessary to deliver next year&#146;s funding requirement. The Government have a statutory responsibility to ensure that the fund is maintained at an appropriate level to meet the operating requirements of the General Lighthouse Authorities. Failure to deliver safe maritime conditions would adversely affect the business interests of commercial enterprises and the safety of vessels and their crews.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_173"></a><a name="09022319000184"></a>We are proposing that light dues rates for merchant vessels calling at UK ports will be adjusted from 1 July this year by 6p from 35p to 41p per net registered ton (NRT); that the tonnage cap will rise from 35,000 to 50,000 NRT, so that the maximum charge per call will become &#163;20,500; and that the voyage cap will be raised from seven voyages to nine voyages, so that a vessel will not be required to pay light dues after nine payments are made in the year. A payment is valid for a rolling month from the day of payment. Through this consultation we are seeking views on a range of options for raising the necessary money.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_174"></a><a name="09022319000185"></a>We have worked with the shipping industry over many years to reduce the costs of providing general aids to navigation and the General Lighthouse Authorities are rightly proud of their operational and financial performance where light dues rates have not had to rise since 1993 and have actually fallen by over 40 per cent against RPI over that period. This has been achieved through major efficiency gains made by the General Lighthouse Authorities resulting in lower operational costs of over 20 per cent in the last decade. We will continue to work with the industry and the General Lighthouse Authorities further to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_175"></a><a name="09022319000186"></a>In 2006, when rates were cut by 10 per cent, we had the industry&#146;s assurance that as a result of this significant reduction, if the General Lighthouse Fund were to face greater financial demands than it could meet, the industry recognised that rates would have to rise. That time has now come and that is why we are proposing to make these changes to the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_49"></a>
<a name="0902235000256"></a><b><a name="90223w0003.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="0902235000704"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change &amp; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> Warm Front is the Government's flagship scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. The scheme currently provides grants for specified insulation and heating measures up to the value of &#163;2,700 or &#163;4,000 for oil central heating (including properties with no access to the gas network).</p>

<a name="90223w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_229"></a><a name="0902235000257"></a>The Government recognise the specific challenge of assisting hard to treat properties in rural communities. The Warm Front Scheme Management Board considers on a regular basis whether to approve appropriate alternative technologies for the scheme, where they might prove cost-effective. The board will consider whether the technology is readily available and reliable, as well as whether there are sufficiently skilled people to install and repair the proposed measure and also how easy it is to use. One example is through Warm Front and National Energy Action and we are currently carrying out a pilot using solar thermal technology together with electric heating.</p>

<a name="90223w0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_230"></a><a name="0902235000258"></a>In addition, Warm Front has a networking team which operates in rural areas to help bring assistance to vulnerable households in rural communities. Pro-actively engaging with local organisations and area-based schemes, it helps to increase the take-up of grants and energy efficiency advice in rural areas.</p>

<a name="90223w0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_231"></a><a name="0902235000259"></a>The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy for driving up household energy efficiency in Britain out to 2011. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to direct at least 40 per cent of carbon savings at priority group households. This includes important measures for hard-to-treat homes such as solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures through fuel switching in the previous three-year obligation period to March 2008 (Energy Efficiency Commitment Two). The Government recognised there is a high up-front cost for these measures and therefore under CERT we have introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of fuel switching, with a particular focus on homes which are off the gas grid.</p>

This packages a range of existing funding sources and uses independent gas transporters with an aim of ensuring the maximum number of vulnerable and fuel poor households should be connected to the gas network at least cost. Those households assisted under the scheme qualify because they either reside within the 20 per cent most deprived areas according to the index of multiple deprivation, qualify for assistance under Warm Front (or similar schemes in the Devolved Nations) or fall within the priority group under CERT.</p>

A copy of the letter has been placed in the Library. In this context, we would expect the PCTs to promote fluoridation during consultations with, where they judge it appropriate, the support of organisations knowledgeable about the arrangement of fluoridation schemes and their effects.</p>

The revision was required because of an administrative error in the preparation of the Answer to a Parliamentary Question on 12 January (<I>Official Report, </I>col. 178W). It was not due to the completion of the review of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_280"></a><a name="0902235000328"></a>The weighted capitation formula determines PCTs' target allocations based on the weighted needs of each PCT'S population. Weighted needs reflect the need for healthcare due to age and additional need over and above that due to age. The measure weighted capitation target per weighted head gives a very similar figure for each PCT to the average for England. This is because each PCT's weighted need is included in both their weighted target and weighted population. The alternative measure of weighted capitation target per unweighted head gives a wider range across PCTs, reflecting PCTs' populations' relative needs for healthcare services.</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_119"></a>
<a name="0902235000420"></a><b><a name="90223w0005.htm_spmin9"></a><a name="0902235000774"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> The Sustainable Communities Plan, published in 2003, set out a long-term vision and programme of action to create decent homes in good quality local environments across England. As part of this plan, the Government set out actions related to construction methods. This included actions to promote modern methods of construction (MMC). MMC can be defined as construction that uses modern processes to provide more, better quality houses in less time. It can apply to homes built on and off-site.</p>

<a name="90223w0005.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_358"></a><a name="0902235000421"></a>The Sustainable Communities Plan set out that some 25 per cent of the homes funded by the (then) Housing Corporation in the south-east would be built using MMC. In the two years following publication of the Sustainable Communities Plan (2004-05 and 2005-06) the Housing Corporation approved investment in London and the south-east which is resulting in the construction and delivery of 13,297 MMC units. This represents some 40 per cent of the total number of homes delivered in both regions.</p>

<a name="90223w0005.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_359"></a><a name="0902235000422"></a>The vision set out in the Sustainable Communities Plan was for new housing to be more sustainable. It proposed that building regulations would be kept under review with this in mind, and set a new requirement that, as a condition of grant, all new homes funded by the public sector should achieve the Eco-Homes pass standard. This was put in place. However, since 2003, the Government have taken more steps to improve further the sustainability of new homes. The Code for Sustainable Homes (the code) became operational in 2007 and replaced Eco-Homes as the sustainable standard in house building. All homes supported by funding from the Homes and Communities Agency must now be built to code level 3. The code, like building regulations, is outcome based and does not require a particular construction method. However, using MMC may be useful to achieve code levels.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_360"></a><a name="0902235000423"></a>Steps have also been taken to strengthen building regulations. In 2006, the Government published revisions to part L of the building regulations which set higher standards for energy performance.

And in 2008 a consultation was launched on proposed changes that would add to part G of these regulations a requirement for new homes to be

<p><a name="wa_stpa_361"></a><a name="0902235000424"></a>In July 2007, the Government confirmed their objective for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016, to be achieved through a progressive tightening of the building regulations from the 2006 standard. And in their 2008 Budget, the Government set out an ambition for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019, with an earlier target (2018) for new public sector buildings. The <I>Definition of Zero Carbon Homes and Non-Domestic Buildings </I>consultation, published on 17 December 2008, sets out the Government's current thinking in this area and calls for further evidence in anticipation of an in-depth consultation on new non-domestic buildings in 2009.
