<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In so doing, I declare an interest as an author of books on tape.
<P>

<a name="20516-01_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20516-01_para1"></a>Whether they will consider removing the VAT on audio-books on the grounds that these are extensively used by the visually impaired.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="20516-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government recognise the importance of audio-books to the visually impaired. However, under longstanding European agreements, no member state is permitted to make substantial extensions to the scope of its zero rates.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer. However, does he agree that, when VAT was introduced in 1973, the audio industry was virtually non-existent? Does he also agree that if the Treasury were rewriting rules now, it might take a different view?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there are certain dangers in the Treasury rewriting the rules. We benefit very substantially from the fact that, when Annex H to the Sixth Directive was introduced in 1992, we already had zero rating not only on books and newspapers, in particular, but also on children's clothes, food and public transport fares. We were able to continue that because we already had the exemption. If we were to start re-opening the Pandora's box of zero rating, we could put that at risk. Much as I sympathise with what the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, says about audio-books, I think that on the whole we would prefer not to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord accept that audio-books have been of great help to blind people, especially when the voices have been recorded by actors and actresses, and that they are available for lending from public libraries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree that audio-books are a great help to blind people. The Royal National Institute for the Blind, after all, has a scheme of talking books for the blind to which it has about 43,000 subscribers. That equipment and that provision is zero rated. Zero rating, however, must be for equipment specifically designed for people <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with disabilities, and we take advantage of that exemption. However, audio-books are also of very great interest to others who are not visually impaired.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, surely the anomaly here, to introduce a discordant note, is the fact that not only books, but magazines, periodicals and pornographic literature&#151;if I may remind my noble friend of the existence of such things; I know because I know the law, not because I have ever seen such things&#151;are zero rated? Is it not strange that we refer to that zero rating as a benefit when the essential point is that VAT really should be levelled on everything? Is it not about time that instead of talking about this benefit, we got rid of the anomaly entirely?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am always prepared to take instruction from my noble friend Lord Peston. However, I disagree. The zero rating which we have for children's clothes, food, books and newspapers, and public transport fares is a very considerable advantage to us. It is indeed in the Labour manifesto that we shall continue to maintain that zero rating.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that audio-books are also a great help to those who are deaf? That is a further reason for liberating them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, says, and I suppose that audio-books could be played very loud. Audio-books are a great pleasure to a very large number of people, including me. I just wish that the readers would read rather faster than they do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that, by taxing audio-books, we are basically just attacking another form of literature? As literature is said to be a good thing, why are audio-books not treated as such?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have been trying to explain that these anomalies have occurred because of the Sixth Directive, and particularly because of Annex H to that directive. There are changes that we might like to make if the lid were taken off this Pandora's box. However, we are, rightly, very nervous about doing that because of the advantages that we gain. I would not argue for significant changes for that very reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister be kind enough to advise us how many people in the United Kingdom and the EU are visually impaired? If by any chance the numbers are significant, would he please arrange to change the directive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not know how many, but clearly it is a very significant <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number. However, I do not see why that should justify a change in the directive. The directive is very significantly to our advantage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, if the Pandora's box can never be opened, can the Minister say why, in another place, the Paymaster General said that no accurate estimate is available of the cost to the Exchequer of zero rating audio-books? Why is there no such estimate? May we have one?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I imagine that there is not one because useful sales figures for audio-books are not available. I do not know the answer to the question, but I do not think that the cost of zero rating audio-books has been a significant factor in our consideration of the issue raised by this Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, given the difficulties outlined and the importance of audio-books to patients recovering from severe injury who are unable to hold conventional books or who have brain tumours and difficulty focusing on a page although they are not classified as visually impaired, do the Government have any intention of trying to provide some financial relief for families faced with caring for those with a severe disability for whom audio-books are a major source of comfort?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as I have made clear, the Government maintain zero rating of VAT for all sorts of equipment and material specifically designed for those with a wide range of disabilities and not just for those with visual impairment. The difficulty with some of these issues, and particularly with audio-books, is that although they are indeed of great help to people with various disabilities, they are also a source of great pleasure to people without disabilities. To introduce a zero rating, even if we could, would be to introduce a further anomaly into the zero-rating system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord said that children's books were zero rated. Are audio-books for children zero rated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not say anything about children's books; I said children's clothes. There is no connection between the two.

<A NAME="20516-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Selsdon </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>What documentation is acceptable as proof of identity to permit British subjects to travel without let or hindrance within the European Union.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, a British passport is the only official <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>document issued in the United Kingdom which establishes both the holder's identity and nationality for travel purposes within the European Union, or anywhere else for that matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, while thanking the Minister for his gracious reply, and not wishing to correct him in any way, perhaps I may remind him that, on the back of our parliamentary passes, it states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"THIS PASS IS AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-01_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20516-01_para3"></a>Will the Minister therefore give consideration to obtaining authorisation for noble Lords to travel without let or hindrance throughout the EU as we have a pass which states that it is an official document? Further, can he tell me why it is necessary for British subjects abroad sometimes to present their passport at least five times before arriving at an airport and clearing Customs in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I think that that is a preposterous suggestion because the photo-identity pass does not identify the person concerned. It might state that it is an official document, and the notice to turn it in to a police station if lost is helpful, but what on earth does that really tell anyone? I therefore find it difficult to take the suggestion seriously.
<P>

<a name="20516-01_para4"></a>As for the serious part of the noble Lord's Question, various nationality and identity issues need to be addressed. Although the barriers are more or less down in a common area, even airlines, for their own security, like passengers to show a photo-pass. That may not be a requirement but they like to know who is on the plane, for various reasons. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the only document that covers both nationality and identity is the passport. That rules out such documents as the photo driving licence, for example.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clark of Windermere: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that an increasing number of our European Union partners now insist that holders of British passports must have passports with at least six months still to run before they are allowed to enter those countries? Is that a fair way to permit freedom of travel within the European Union? Does my noble friend realise that it clearly reduces a 10-year passport to a 9&#189;-year one?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes some important points but his final sentence is incorrect. We changed the rules on that matter some time ago. Some countries require travellers to have passports with a minimum of six months still to run as a condition of supplying a visa. I refer to the efficiency of the Passport Agency. I take no credit for its performance as the Minister responsible for it. It is one of the most efficient executive agencies in government and processes 100 per cent of normal passport applications within 10 days. If one applies in sufficient time, the Passport Agency will extend the relevant date of a passport to prevent people losing out and having, in effect, a 9&#189;-year passport.

<A NAME="20516-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, on a number of previous occasions when speaking from the Dispatch Box my noble friend has used the term "entitlement card". Will he review that language and refer to the entitlement card in future as the national identity card as that would be much easier for people to understand?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the Home Office-speak is "entitlement card". As I have said repeatedly&#151;I am grateful to my noble friend for reminding noble Lords of this matter&#151;in the summer we shall produce a consultation paper on the possible uses of entitlement cards. The consultation period will be much longer than usual to permit a national debate on the issue. Given the configuration of dates involved in this matter, the date of 21st May with regard to British overseas citizens and the constant references to Gibraltar in this House, I should say in case I am asked about the matter&#151;in that way I shall avoid being asked about it&#151;that the Gibraltarian passport, which is a British dependent territory passport, allows free, unhindered travel within the European Union.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister consider that it is strictly relevant to have babies of under six months photographed for passport purposes? I make that point as this afternoon I shall have to take my daughter who is under three months and stick her in a photo booth. I believe that the photograph will resemble just about any baby of that age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, technical discussions are taking place with regard to biometrics and passports. In due course there will be an international requirement for passports to be produced with the use of biometrics. That requirement will apply irrespective of the use of identity cards or entitlement cards. I am told that it may be possible for the photograph to involve the use of biometrics in facial scanning. I did not inquire about the minimum age at which facial scanning is accurate. However, I suspect that it is not three months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I have every sympathy with anyone in another European country who will not accept a pass of a Member of this House as proof of identity? I cannot even use my pass as proof of identity in some of the larger London stores. There is a problem in that regard. However, as increasing numbers of people travel there is an increasing need to simplify the matter. Given the Prime Minister's new found enthusiasm for European issues, should not this matter be looked at urgently? Whether it is decided to have an entitlement card or an identity card it seems to me that that will be the way in which the Government will be forced to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it is not a question of being forced to move. It is well known, as it has been published in the business plan of the Passport Agency, that in due course it is proposed to issue a passport <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>card to make travelling easier. That would not be a substitute for a passport but would be issued in addition to it. There is already an experiment under way at Heathrow as regards fast scanning of frequent travellers. Frequent travellers can register with an iris scan, for example, and will not require a passport. They will not need to queue at passport control as they can be scanned. We are introducing such initiatives to make travelling easier. Some 90 million people move in and out of the country each year. We want to make travelling as convenient as possible for the majority but ensure that we keep out or apprehend the minority whom we do not want. We are moving in that direction. That matter may be included in the consultation paper on the entitlement card.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister recall that the late and great Lord Hunt of Everest fame said that if you look like your passport photograph you are too ill to travel?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I plead guilty. I do not know whether I am one of the younger Members of the House but I do not like my photograph and I shall get it renewed as soon as possible.

<A NAME="20516-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to add the British Transport Police to the 10 police forces prioritised under the national robbery initiative.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the matter is being considered but the British Transport Police are already closely involved in activity to tackle street crime, working jointly with the various police forces. The Government intend further to enhance the role played by the British Transport Police, particularly in the London area which accounts for over 50 per cent of street crime across the 10 targeted areas and some 88 per cent of the incidents of robbery within the total British Transport Police jurisdiction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. The British Transport Police apprehend many street robbers&#151;I believe that they are about fifth or sixth in the relevant table&#151;and the 10 forces have extra resources. Will the Minister say specifically whether the British Transport Police can also be given extra resources to fund either personnel or equipment to cover the many places around London stations where street robbers are active?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give details about any future money for the British Transport Police. The total strength of the force is just over 2,100. If one disregards the headquarters total, which is 100, that leaves just over 1,000 personnel in London. Half of the personnel of the British Transport Police work in London, 300 in both north and south London and 400 <P>


<a name="column_423"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the Underground. That is an enormous resource. They are involved in the work of the safer streets initiative in London in particular. I understand that exercises are taking place with regard to Connex special constables. Connex staff are being trained and accredited as special constables under the sponsorship of Connex although they are special constables for the British Transport Police. I understand that so far 130 employees have shown an interest in the scheme. It is planned to have 30 Specials sponsored by Connex. I understand that 16 commenced training on 15th April. Work is taking place to improve the "up front" appearance and presence of the British Transport Police, particularly in the London area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that if half the British Transport Police are stationed in the London area, there are not many of them in other areas where an enormous amount of vandalism takes place? I refer to the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and the North East. I assume that their remit covers Scotland. Is not the balance a little out of kilter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, not as regards where the crime takes place. My noble friend mentioned Scotland. Some 200 British Transport Police cover Scotland. That is some 10 per cent of the total. They operate also on the national rail networks, the Docklands Light Railway, the Croydon Tram Link and London Underground. They do not operate on the road network or in Northern Ireland. As I said in my initial Answer, the London area accounts for over 50 per cent of street crime across the 10 targeted areas of the street crime initiative and some 88 per cent of the incidents of robbery within the total British Transport Police jurisdiction. Therefore, the concentration of British Transport Police in London is justified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Mayor of London is doing his best to enter into contractual arrangements with the Metropolitan Police to purchase in effect additional policemen specifically to cover bus services? Does the Minister consider that that represents a good vote of confidence in the existing arrangements given that it will obviously provide a welcome improvement in the situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the one way to make transport safer in London&#151;and what the Metropolitan Police want to do&#151;is to include in the Police Reform Bill the community safety officers accreditation scheme to enable the Metropolitan Police to appoint some 300 or 400 extra personnel on the streets of London this year, including a good proportion who will be supervised by London Transport. I hope that when the Bill returns to your Lordships' House in due course the scheme will receive the approval of noble Lords and that the Metropolitan Police will be able to introduce it.

<a name="column_424"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specialist forces and territorial forces within the police? Specialist forces represent some interesting historical anomalies&#151;the origins of railway company police and so on. When considering legislation in this House, we have discussed the overlap between specialist forces and territorial forces. Is there a case for the Government looking at specialist forces&#151;I forget exactly how many there are; I believe, eight or nine&#151;and the territorial forces as a whole?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to take advice on that. I know of no moves in that regard. We debated specialist forces during the passage of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, including the Ministry of Defence Police, the Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary&#151;which is an armed police force with a specific remit&#151;and the British Transport Police. I know of no discussions that would lead to the conclusions raised by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it does not make much difference to a victim of crime whether he is robbed on the Underground or in the street? Does he find it a little odd that the Home Office forces&#151;10 of them&#151;will be given substantial extra money to deal with robbery, which we all welcome, but that the British Transport Police, which saw a 29 per cent rise in robberies last year, are apparently having to struggle to get the modest &#163;1.43 million for which they asked the Home Office?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, that would probably be a consequence of the spending review later on. Of the 2,700 robberies reported to the British Transport Police, 581 were cleared up. That involves a detection rate of 21 per cent. Their current budget is around &#163;120 million. I stress that the British Transport Police are actively involved with the police around the country through the street crime initiative in Merseyside, Lancashire, Manchester, Thames Valley and the West Midlands where they are actively involved with what I call the Home Office police on a series of initiatives. They are currently doing that. There is not a question of their needing money to participate in such initiatives.

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements could lead to substantial increases in fares to make up the amounts of money that are required by London Underground? Figures of up to 25 per cent have been mentioned. Will he give the assurance that that is unlikely to happen and that if there are to be any fare increases, they will be limited to the rate of inflation? Furthermore, will he give an assurance that, in light of the tragic accident at Potters Bar, increased attention will be paid to the supervision of maintenance by contractors on the Underground?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, on the noble Lord's first point, there are many rumours&#151;most of them wrong&#151;about the major PPP for London Underground. The decision about fares on the Underground will be for the Mayor, in consultation with the Assembly. So far as the Government are concerned, we have set the subsidy to go into the PPP for the first seven and a half years at a level that should not require fare rises that are higher than the rate of inflation.
<P>

<a name="20516-03_para0"></a>With regard to Potters Bar&#151;we could have had a topical Question on it&#151;it is early days to make judgments about what happened. The Health and Safety Executive and others are rapidly investigating the causes so that we can ensure that any lessons are learnt rapidly. I can report to the House that London Underground has completed an inspection of 80 points on the Underground system that bore some similarities to Potters Bar, but it has found no faults with them.

He will be aware that the three members of the consortia that were recently awarded a contract for London Underground have announced that the contract will return an annual profit of &#163;18 million a year, which is &#163;540 million over the lifetime of the contract. That represents a 34 per cent return on turnover. When one considers that 95 per cent of the third party debt is covered by a letter of comfort from the Government, how can the Minister tell the House that that represents good value for the taxpayer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to confirm that the Government judge&#151;as do London Underground, Ernst & Young, which advised the Government, and the accountants who advised London Underground&#151;that that did provide good value for money. There are two reasons for that. First, I do not recognise the figures quoted by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. I do recognise that the infrastructure companies have budgeted for or are hoping to achieve&#151;that is different&#151;a return of 15 to 20 per cent on their capital employed. That relates only to the capital that they put in and not to the contractual value of the contracts that will be let, which are substantially subsidy-funded as well as being funded by equity from the infrastructure companies.
<P>

<a name="20516-03_para1"></a>The second point, which goes to the heart of the reason why we believe that the PPP will demonstrate good value for money to the public, involves the <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appalling cost over-runs on previous infrastructure projects. The noble Viscount will know better than I do, because this happened when his party was in government, that the Jubilee Line was three years late and, I believe, some 60 per cent over cost. Moreover, the Central Line extension&#151;in fact, it was another extension&#151;was several years late and involved substantial over-spend. More generally, there are problems with the public sector controlling such contracts, as we have seen historically. That is why London Underground and the Government believe that the sort of contracts that put pressure on the private sector to perform are much better and are in the interests of the public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall&#151;he probably does not because he was not in this place at the time&#151;that the question from the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, about London Underground, was exactly the sort of question that we used to put to Conservative Members when they were trying to privatise Railtrack? The same comment was made about the disastrous cost over-runs that occurred. Does he agree that the best solution&#151;this has been done in the rest of Europe for many years&#151;is to hand over the metro systems to local authorities as soon as possible and let them and their politicians stand or fail by their records of service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, as I am sure my noble friend knows, that is exactly what the Government are doing with London Underground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew11"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, let me elucidate for the House. The Government are funding the PPP project to the scale of &#163;8.1 billion over the next&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew13"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the question will be answered if noble Lords would wait. We are funding the PPP project to the scale of &#163;8.1 billion over the next eight years. That naturally involves a right to ensure that there is a sound basis for that investment. As soon as those contracts are let and all other clearances are given, London Underground, as part of London Transport, will be transferred to Transport for London, which is the responsibility of the Mayor and the Assembly. It will come directly under democratic, local authority control through the GLA and the Mayor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will be aware that one of the fears of London's government&#151;I declare an interest as a Member of the London Assembly&#151;and of London's taxpayers is that it will be found that London Underground has many liabilities that are unfunded and not disclosed. There is a concern that London Underground is not even aware of all of its liabilities. When did London Underground <P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>last conduct a detailed audit of its assets? Will the Minister assure the House that London Underground's risk register is up to date?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, London Underground has a reasonable understanding of its assets, but I do not believe that it has a comprehensive asset register of the depth that one would hope for in an ideal world. I believe that it has a good understanding of the major liabilities, as one would expect, given the amount of survey work that will have been done to let the scale of contracts that are now being let. Enormous contract sums are involved and will have required detailed surveying of the infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="20516-03_para2"></a>With regard to any future unforeseen eventualities&#151;given life, one must be certain that they will arrive&#151;clearly there will always be ongoing discussions between the Mayor, Transport for London and the Government, just as there are between other local authorities. But that is not to imply that there is an open door or a blank cheque. The Mayor has a responsibility to make those assets work well, to manage the substantial undertaking that Transport for London is taking on with London Underground, and to achieve value from those assets and from the massive capital investment that the Government have subsidised. We very much hope that he does that well because it will be to his credit and the credit of London if he succeeds in it. We believe that we have given him an enormous start.

<a name="20516-04_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the arguments over this area of the Bill have been well rehearsed and cogently argued. That is, no doubt, why everyone is leaving the Chamber. I shall therefore be as brief as I can.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para3"></a>We all agree that education, training and research are vital for the future of the NHS. The Government's plans to expand the number of doctors, nurses and other staff makes that even more important. We know that all is not well at present. On Report I highlighted the fact that Guy's, King's and St Thomas' schools of medicine are now shedding clinical teaching staff on a vast scale.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para4"></a>However, this matter does not only concern medical schools&#151;far from it. It concerns the whole of the health service. If it works effectively, devolution within the health service should produce a massive shift to local areas and their needs. Of course, much of that is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para5"></a>But national standards and national needs must also be addressed. We have expressed our concerns about that elsewhere in the Bill, and we shall return to the issue when looking at specialist commissioning. Clearly, giving a high priority to education, training and research is exactly one such area. It may not seem a pressing need at local level, given all the other competing claims, but it is what will underpin the future of the health service. We all agree on that.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para6"></a>This debate turns on the difference between the words "may" and "must". We say that at all levels of the service, research, education and training must be supported. The Government seem to believe that "may" is enough. In Committee the Minister said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is in the interests of the National Health Service and the Government to ensure that we address [those areas]",&#151;[Official Report, 18/3/02; col. 1117.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-04_para7"></a>
Indeed!
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para8"></a>At Report stage, the Minister pointed out that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"primary care trusts are empowered to 'conduct, commission or assist in the conduct of research'",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-04_para9"></a>
and that they can,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'make officers and facilities available in connection with training'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-04_para10"></a>
That is, they can, but they do not have to.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para11"></a>The Minister said that he accepted that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is an issue [here] in regard to power and duty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-04_para12"></a>
That is, indeed, the point. He spoke of dedicated funding streams for teaching and research, adding,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I do not believe that primary care trusts will be under pressure to spend that money for other purposes".&#151;[Official Report, 29/4/02; col. 507.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-04_para13"></a>
I trust that noble Lords will excuse my scepticism here. On Report I quoted a case where administrators had sought to redirect money from research and teaching into a black hole by the tactic of increasing the levy charged for allowing their premises to be used. There are ways and means of tapping into such money.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para14"></a>I take another case in point. The Government announce increased expenditure on cancer. Does it reach the areas that it is supposed to reach? It does not&#151;to the enormous frustration of patients and clinicians, as the Minister knows.
<P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para15"></a>The Minister is, and knows that he is, overly-optimistic if he believes that permitting the support of research and teaching, as opposed to ensuring such support, will be adequate. We know how much pressure there is on administrators to ensure each year that they achieve their various targets, not least financial ones. Education, training and research must not be squeezed out by such pressures.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para16"></a>The amendment is very simple. It says that in the interests of the future of the health service and, therefore, of patients, trusts and strategic health authorities must have a duty to safeguard and promote education, training and research. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches support Amendment No. 1. The issue of safeguarding and promoting education, training and research was debated thoroughly both in Committee and on Report. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, has summarised the key concerns that were raised on all sides of the House. Those concerns were largely expressed in terms of medical education, training and research, but the amendment is rightly drawn in the widest possible terms and embraces all aspects of education, training and research relevant to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para17"></a>I do not believe that there is any disagreement in this House about the importance of education, training and research, or about the fact that there are currently problems in delivery. The disagreement focuses on how big that problem is and how well the existing structures of the NHS will allow education, training and research to thrive and prosper.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para18"></a>At earlier stages of the Bill, the Minister referred to the powers that exist in NHS legislation. I do not believe that the existence of the powers has ever been suggested to be the issue. The issue is whether the powers are being used. That is why the amendment includes the word "duty". The Minister has never explained why he believes that there should not be a duty on the face of the legislation. He has rightly pointed out that what is important is what happens in practice, and we have heard many fine aspirations about teaching and research. I doubt that anyone in the NHS or, indeed, in your Lordships' House would not sign up to those aspirations.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para19"></a>However, it is plain to all those involved that teaching and research in the NHS are vulnerable and threatened. In practice, the process simply does not work well enough. There is ample anecdotal evidence that teaching and research resources are squeezed at NHS trusts. For example, lecture rooms are used for other purposes; doctors are so overwhelmed by the day-to-day demands placed on them that little or no time remains available for research; and there is a staffing crisis at universities.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para20"></a>The Minister has expressed considerable confidence that central earmarking of funds for teaching and research means that those funds are spent on those matters. But, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said, many in the NHS do not believe that.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para21"></a>It is tempting to think that the extra resources being put into the NHS as a result of the recent Budget will make the problem go away. Part of the problem has, <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indeed, been the squeeze on NHS finances. But I do not believe that it is as simple as that. It is far from clear that any extra resources will find their way into teaching and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para22"></a>The heart of the question is whether all the bodies in the NHS with a role to play in education, training and research will, in fact, deliver. Many of us have doubts about PCTs, both in relation to their lack of preparedness for their responsibilities and their natural primary care orientation. Both those features mean that there can be no certainty that PCTs will commission in a way that promotes and safeguards education, training and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para23"></a>I have already mentioned the concerns that exist at the level of NHS trusts. That leaves strategic health authorities. On Report the Minister told the House that there would be health and education sector partnerships at the level of strategic health authorities. In Committee, he laid stress on the role of strategic health authorities in performance managing PCTs if they do not achieve what those authorities believe that they should. One must have great faith in the efficacy of loose structures and untried processes to believe that that will solve the problem. It is clear to me that the responsibility of NHS bodies for education, training and research needs to be put beyond doubt. That is why we support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I have had the privilege of being involved in clinical practice in the NHS since its inception. For many years I was involved in teaching medical students and in clinical research. It is generally acknowledged that the standard of medical education in this country over all those years has been second to none. It is also generally acknowledged that clinical research, much of it conducted in the National Health Service, in the hospitals and in the community, has been responsible for enormous developments in patient care.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para24"></a>The National Health Service Act 1946 included a requirement that teaching and research should be supported from the beginning. At the start of the health service there was a knock-for-knock agreement, by which it was agreed that clinical academics working in and employed by the universities should devote six half days a week of their time to clinical service and five half days in a week to teaching and research. The other part of that agreement required NHS staff, including consultants, to give teaching services to medical students and to other staff. Many years ago that agreement was eroded. Evidence from the heads of medical schools&#151;the Council of Heads of Medical Schools&#151;clearly indicates that many clinical academics are spending a minimum of 40 hours a week and some as much as 58 hours a week in clinical practice to the detriment of teaching and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para25"></a>One outcome has been that many young clinical academics, due to a lack of research productivity, have not been able to persuade the research assessment exercise of the Higher Education Funding Council that they are involved as sufficiently in research as they should be, in order to improve the funding of their particular medical schools. The consequence has been <P>


<a name="column_431"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that because of cuts in funding by the Higher Education Funding Council, a considerable number of clinical academic staff in two London medical schools will be made redundant. That is happening at a time when the Government are committed to increasing medical student numbers because of the massive shortage of doctors in the National Health Service. I therefore sympathise with and support the intention underlying the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para26"></a>Another reason why I do so is that there is a shortage of recruits into clinical academic medicine. That is not surprising. There are 73 vacant chairs and almost 300 vacant clinical lectureships because the attractions of academic work and of teaching and research have been steadily eroded, often by pressures from managers in the NHS trying to compel members of staff to see more and more patients in order to reduce out-patients' and in-patients' waiting times and many other factors.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para27"></a>The Minister has been kind enough to tell me that he has had discussions with the Council of Heads of Medical Schools. I agree with what has been said already, that there is a difference between a permissive power within an Act, which gives the right or the opportunity of health service bodies to support teaching and research and a requirement that they must do so. For the life of me, I cannot see why there can be any objection to an amendment of this nature being put on the face of the Bill. I hope that the Government will use its good offices, in consultation with the universities, and with the health service bodies, to make certain that the clinical practice of clinical academics will be reduced and that their time for teaching and research will be preserved. I support the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, throughout its passage I have consistently tried to get the word "duty" on to the face of the Bill. I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Walton, say that the Minister has had talks with the heads of medical schools. I understand that the Minister may give noble Lords some words of comfort, which to some extent I welcome. Words of comfort can evaporate in the mists of time. We want the word "duty" to be incorporated into the Act so that there is a "must do", a requirement and so that there is no ambivalence.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para28"></a>At Report stage I gave your Lordships an example of where I felt a duty was important. I mentioned my son, who had a penchant for motorbikes. He was very reluctant to use a crash helmet. In the language of the young, he felt that it was not cool. But a law was introduced, so as a parent, I had authority to say to my son, "You are not going on that motorbike without a crash helmet". What I did not tell your Lordships on that occasion was that about two months later the splendid East Sussex Ambulance Service scraped him off the road. I and the Ambulance Service have no doubt that the crash helmet saved his life, or at least saved serious brain damage.
<P>


<a name="column_432"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para29"></a>I am anxious to avoid serious brain damage for United Kingdom plc. Without a doubt, I agree that there is a crisis in academic chairs and young lectureships, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Walton. I have heard others say that in this country we excel in the quantity and the quality of our medical research. The noble Lord said that he believed it was the best in the world; I have heard that it is the second best in the world because the United States is a little better than us. That is not surprising as the United States is very large and very rich.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para30"></a>Not only do we excel in quantity and in quality, but we also excel in our cost-effectiveness. We are innovative. We are good at thinking up new ways of doing things. One has only to look at the Cochrane collaboration which is now being replicated all over the world. That is one man's vision and one man's inspiration. Sir Ian Chalmers conceived that and has firmly established it.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para31"></a>I believe that we have real strength and more. Amazingly, we have so many opportunities: new opportunities in epidemiology, in tracking disease and in finding cures because we have a unique patient database that we can use. As primary care develops&#151;I have much sympathy with what the Government are doing to try to strengthen primary care&#151;we can build further on much of the research and, more importantly, on joint training in primary care and in the community. In the future, teamwork will deliver the services.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para32"></a>We can also involve patients more directly in understanding science and research. In that context there is a mission. It is less threatening to understand a research project in which one is invited to take part when it is explained to one in the familiarity of a GP's surgery rather than in some remote, cold, clinical hospital. In this country we have a huge communications problem in promoting the public's understanding of science and research. For decades the Royal College of General Practitioners has promoted and encouraged research in general practice. When reading the BMJ it is encouraging to see how much of that journal is dedicated to publishing peer-reviewed research carried out by GPs and occasionally by nurses and other health professionals working in community medicine.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para33"></a>That is a terrific picture. We really excel. Enormous achievements are being made, but I share the grave concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and my noble friend Lady Noakes. Against the background of all that achievement, many of us fear that the enormous pressures now being exerted on primary care teams, GPs and other staff to meet targets will erode what we have achieved so far. I work intimately with primary care trusts at present, which is rewarding and interesting, but the pressures on them are huge. There are targets for waiting times in surgeries and referrals, national service frameworks, health improvement programmes, patient involvement, GP assessment, cancer plans and the need to balance the books, recruit staff and so on. <P>


<a name="column_433"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Their agenda is enormous. I am sure that the Minister would agree that the new boards and professional executive committees will face a huge challenge.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para34"></a>I am certain that research and training is not at the top of the list&#151;it is going continually down the list as more pressures are placed on trusts to deliver. My noble friend Lady Noakes and the noble Lord, Lord Walton, talked about commissioning, so I shall not go into that, but I point out that primary care trust boards are not only commissioners but managers. They are in fear of a visit from the Commission for Health Improvement and are having to learn about all their new work as managers as well as commissioners. That is why they should also have a duty in respect of research and development.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para35"></a>One of the great hallmarks of your Lordships' House has been its championing of research and scientific endeavour. I remind your Lordships that it was this House that in 1992 persuaded the government to introduce the post of Director of Research and Development in the Department of Health. That was strongly resisted at the time, but it was eventually conceded. That post, which was the result of an initiative from your Lordships' House, has made a marked difference to how the National Health Service now invests in and carries out research.
<P>

<a name="20516-04_para36"></a>I suggest that we hold to that which we know to be true, eschew the warm words of comfort that I suspect that we shall hear from the Minister and support this cross-party amendment with some of the same determination that the House exercised 10 years ago.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I shall briefly amplify what my noble friend said. For several years, I was chairman of a medical research ethics committee. We considered about 350 research projects every year. Those projects took place in our area&#151;we were attached to a teaching hospital and to a university&#151;because so many GPs, hospitals and other NHS people were willing to take part in research. If hospitals or GP surgeries were not prepared to take part, much of that research could not take place. The Minister well knows that there must be a constant search for new drugs, which requires new trials over a wide area of the country. It is essential that GPs and hospitals at trust level are prepared to take part in those trials.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para0"></a>Apart from that, the knowledge that research is taking place locally helps to recruit local people to take part in research as victims, as it were. That is important. It also makes for a lively NHS staff. Teaching and training must continue, even at cleaner level, but if research does not continue people are not aware that practices must be constantly updated&#151;tried out, undertaken and established&#151;in order to run a good show. There is no question but that that must be an obligation at trust level. I hope that the Minister will give in, because so far his response has been somewhat inadequate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Emerton: </B>   My Lords, I, too, want to speak in favour of the amendment. If healthcare is to be effective and improved, we must promote and safeguard education, training and research not only in <P>


<a name="column_434"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>medicine but in so many other healthcare professions&#151;in nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy and so on. That is why I welcome the breadth of the terms of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para1"></a>We must bear in mind that research in some of those professions started later than in medicine. I was associated with some of the first research into clinical nursing in the 1960s, which was sponsored by the Department of Health. We therefore have a much shorter history of research into nursing than has the medical profession. That is why I support the amendment with all my heart.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I rise not only to speak to the amendment but to explain the reason for the difference between its wording and that of Amendment No. 3, which stands in my name. The push for increased learning and the culture of learning across the NHS has been widely heralded as government policy. We have clearly heard the arguments why more resources need to go into education, training and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para2"></a>Perhaps I may briefly illustrate that with an example from this morning in my hospital medical school. There were not enough tutorial rooms for one group of students to be taught, and 40 of them were trailing across the campus and looking for a room. The increased number of students coming through the system is putting an enormous pressure on teaching space. Sadly, the powers that are meant to be in place to ensure that their education and training is supported have not been implemented and have not kept pace.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para3"></a>There is great concern that with the new private finance initiative bills for new hospitals, finance is not being set aside to ensure adequate teaching rooms. There should be tutorial rooms on wards so that the high standard of clinical training for which this country is renowned can continue, but making a room available and ensuring that it remains available costs money. In many hospitals around the country, a teaching room was set aside but has been taken over and not replaced because of the pressure for office space.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para4"></a>The reason for the different wording of Amendment No. 3 is that the pattern of commissioning services in Wales will be different from that in England and it has not been finally decided whether there will be three health authorities. Hence the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"those commissioning specialist services on behalf of the National Assembly for Wales".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-05_para5"></a>
I understand from the Minister, Jane Hutt, that there will be three offices of the National Assembly for Wales&#151;one in the North, one in the West and one in the South-East&#151;which will take over many of the duties and commissioning obligations currently held by the health authorities which are in the process of being abolished. It is certain that not all of those responsibilities will be devolved to local health boards, because they are not ready to cope with complex commissioning. They will fall between the boards and the specialist commissioning body for Wales, which <P>


<a name="column_435"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 435</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will deal with rare and highly specialised commissioning. So commissioning of services such as cancer services, which cut across all trusts, needs to occur at a level that is currently not clearly determined.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para6"></a>Hence the different wording, but the amendments are compatible in spirit and in placing a duty on those at all levels&#151;out in the community and in hospitals&#151;to ensure that the high standards for which Britain has been renowned do not slip. Sadly, the Research Assessment Exercise demonstrated that over the years there has been slippage in academic surgery departments. The number of them that are world-class is declining, but those arguments have already been eloquently made by other noble Lords.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendments in the group, particularly Amendment No. 3, which applies the basic principles to Wales, where, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, said, the organisation of the health service is to be somewhat different.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para7"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said, we covered this ground in Committee. The Minister made great play of the fact that other NHS legislation gave permissive powers to promote education, training and research. As my noble friend Lord Howe said, those permissive powers do not amount to a duty. Your Lordships generally believe that such a duty should be imposed on the authorities named in the new clauses. The need for such a duty is particularly pressing, now that the Government have admitted that more frontline staff will be required, if their ambitions for the NHS are to have the slightest chance of being achieved.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para8"></a>We are all aware of current staff vacancies in the medical schools. I have a report from the Council of Heads of Medical Schools that gives all the details. There are 73 unfilled professorial posts out of 1,042 full-time equivalents. There are 118 reader/senior lecturer vacancies out of 1,663 posts and 136 lecturer vacancies out of 844 posts. Those are fairly high percentages. The report says that the percentage of vacant posts is a cause for concern, especially in the context of the rapid expansion of medical education.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para9"></a>I suspect that the report is somewhat dated by now. If anything, the situation has worsened, since the publication of the report, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, intimated. The need for training, education and research is more pressing than ever. There should be a duty on the authorities to promote them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, some powerful points have already been made, and I shall speak briefly in support of the amendment in my name and the names of my noble friend Lady Northover and others.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para10"></a>The safeguarding of teaching, training and research at all levels is extremely important. The amendment is well designed to do that. One could go through the <P>


<a name="column_436"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>range of training, research and teaching, as several noble Lords have done in a cogent manner. For me, the tip of the iceberg was revealed in a report that appeared in The Times on Monday about redundancies at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Hospitals. There have been reports about Imperial College and Queen Mary and Westfield College. I understand that further redundancies are on the way at Queen Mary and Westfield College. At a time when, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, said, we are meant to be increasing the number of places for medical students, such reports are symptomatic of the place of teaching and research in the Government's thinking&#151;rather low down.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para11"></a>Although the same system of research assessment takes place in Scotland, it does not have, as far as I am aware&#151;I have been there for the past few days&#151;the same problem as we do. In England&#151;I stress England, although it may apply to Wales too&#151;there is a problem with joined-up government. Once the research assessment has been carried out and grades given, a funding problem arises. I suspect also that medical research carried out by clinicians is not rated as highly for the purposes of the RAE as pure science research. That is also a symptom of the problem.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para12"></a>It is a matter of enormous concern. We will not have the increase in the number of doctors that we need, unless we do things properly. This is a first step. Government action is needed, but a signal of this kind would go all the way through the NHS and would be extremely important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, at lunchtime today, one of your Lordships told me that he had to travel to South Africa every month to get treatment for leukaemia. The procedure is not undertaken in the UK. We are slipping behind in several areas of serious healthcare. In that case, the countries that can provide the treatment for the noble Lord's leukaemia are South Africa, the United States and Israel. Why is it not available in Britain? I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-05_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, it has been an interesting debate. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that there is no disagreement about the importance of teaching and research in the National Health Service. The argument is about the best way to ensure that the NHS gives appropriate support to teaching and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para13"></a>Noble Lords kindly referred to the comments that I made at earlier stages of the Bill's progress. They will know that I am not convinced that the best way forward is to create a duty in the Bill, especially as the amendments do not define the words "education", "training" and "research". If the amendments were accepted, they would leave only a vague sense of what was required by NHS organisations. I must also repeat the point that I made at earlier stages, although I shall not repeat the various references to earlier legislation. Legislation already allows the Secretary of State to support teaching and research and to ensure that arrangements are made for such facilities&#151;a subject <P>


<a name="column_437"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff&#151;as he considers are reasonably required by any university for clinical teaching and research.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para14"></a>Notwithstanding the legislation, the real issue&#151;and the core of the argument&#151;is how we ensure that the NHS takes those matters seriously. I accept that that is the challenge, particularly for primary care trusts. I had a meeting this week with the Council of Heads of Medical Schools that was, in the light of our earlier debates, most useful and constructive. I had a welcome opportunity to explore with the council ways in which we could ensure that primary care trusts provided the necessary support, by which I mean engaging patients and carers in support of teaching and research; fostering the special opportunities for research available in primary care; teaching the entire range of health profession students; and taking full account of teaching and research in their commissioning of local and more distant hospital and specialist services.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para15"></a>I told the council that the Government expected that the primary care trusts would grasp the opportunity to ensure the long-term success of the NHS Plan and the continuing contribution of the NHS to health-related research and education. I accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, about the extraordinary expansion of research capability among primary care workers and general practitioners.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para16"></a>The Government have listened carefully to the arguments made by noble Lords at each stage of the Bill's passage. I am in no doubt about the need to modernise the arrangements for liaison and partnership between the health and education sectors, in order to address some of the issues raised. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, suggested that there was some defect in the arrangements for liaison between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills. While I do not necessarily accept that is so, I agree that we need to streamline the liaison arrangements between the two Departments and other organisations in the education sector. Officials in my Department and the DFES are drawing up proposals to develop a new national framework to ensure joint working, to take forward the education, research and service agendas&#151;and to obtain an overview of the inter-relationship between them. The role of primary care trusts will of course be part of that consideration and the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health will play a leading role.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para17"></a>Agreement has already been announced for a strategic alliance between my department and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. That alliance covers learning, teaching and research and builds on the earlier alliance between the Department and HEFCE on research issues. This is the ideal opportunity to pick up on some of the matters raised by your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para18"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, mentioned her work in regard to research ethic committees&#151;and I agree with her points. This morning, in the Ministerial high-level strategic group that my Department and others, including the DTI, have with the research-based pharmaceutical industry, agreement was <P>


<a name="column_438"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reached between the industry and the Government to institute work that will look specifically at how primary care trusts can contribute more effectively to clinical research.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para19"></a>A number of points were made about clinical academics and that profession's relationship with the expansion in medical school places. The Department of Health and HEFCE have established a joint group to oversee the implementation of medical schools expansion. That group's membership will include the Chair of the General Medical Council's education committee. Part of the group's remit will be to monitor recruitment to posts needed to facilitate the expansion of medical students. It will identify other issues related to that expansion and recommend appropriate action. The group's first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. Clinical academic staffing is a key issue on the agenda.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para20"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane, is right to suggest that we ought not to confine our remarks to medical teaching and research. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness's pioneering work in excellence in nursing research and teaching. My comments in terms of principles should be applied to the other health professions.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para21"></a>It is good to welcome back the noble Lord, Lord Walton, to our debates. He specifically mentioned issues relating to clinical scientists. Last year, I was pleased to launch a new clinical scientists scheme&#151;which came about as a result of long-standing concerns about clinical academic career prospects. A report by the Academy of Medical Science recommended extra clinical scientific posts and we were able to build on that recommendation.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para22"></a>In additional to work at national level, I envisage local partnerships involving strategic health authorities, workforce development confederations, primary care trusts, NHS trusts, universities and other education establishments. Those partnerships will in the main be across the areas of strategic health authorities&#151;which in any case have a strong performance management role in relation to PCTs and will be well able to pick up on issues of concern if they consider that the actions of PCTs are damaging the interests of teaching research in their strategic health authority areas.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para23"></a>It is extremely important that one of the non-executive members for each strategic health authority will be from an institution within the higher education sector responsible for the delivery of pre-registration education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing or other allied health professions. That will enable strategic health authorities to be clear about their responsibilities in relation to teaching and research. My experience of non-executives appointed from higher education institutes is that they are not backward at coming froward. I am sure that they will be encouraged to do so.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para24"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Northover and Lady Noakes, were concerned that central funding for research, learning and development would not be spent appropriately at local level. All the funding is allocated directly to NHS providers, including <P>


<a name="column_439"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 439</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primary care organisations. Funding streams are separately accounted for while other dedicated funding streams for teaching and learning&#151;such as the PGEA and study leave for general practitioners&#151;are also managed separately, to ensure their protection. Those arrangements secure the teaching and research funding protection that your Lordships rightfully sought.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para25"></a>As to the amendments, PFI is a bit of a red herring. I invite the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, to visit the Norwich and Norfolk NHS Trust, which only opened a few months ago. There is a new medical school across the road. The noble Baroness would see for herself that it is impossible within a PFI scheme to enhance teaching, research and clinical services.
<P>

<a name="20516-05_para26"></a>Amendment No. 3 would confer a general power on the Welsh Assembly to establish local health boards. As to my comments about teaching research, such matters are for the Welsh Assembly. It would be inappropriate to include specific limited examples in a general permissive power, as that would frustrate the whole purpose of establishing a national assembly. I assure the noble Baroness and others that I recognise the issues that have been raised.

<A NAME="20516-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, it is not the intention to sabotage the role of the National Assembly for Wales. Its purpose is to ensure equal provision and that standards of educational facilities in Wales match those in England.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness should take up that matter with the Welsh Assembly. It is not an issue on which I, as a Department of Health Minister, can comment.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para0"></a>I hope that I have convinced your Lordships that I regard education, training and research as extremely important. I so agree with the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that high-quality teaching of research is crucial. It is the bedrock of the NHS and of the superb professionalism of our staff. It goes wider. It is a critical factor in the success of the UK as a nation. I understand that your Lordships are concerned not to see any dissipation&#151;and no one should doubt my determination to enhance our teaching and research capacity. The proposed new clause is superfluous. Key is vigorous action.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para1"></a>Clear recognition of PCTs' responsibilities in teaching research, streamlining of the relationship between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills, the strategic alliance between the Department and HEFCE, the initiation of work with the research-based pharmaceutical industry on PCT contribution to clinical research and the special group involving the Department and HEFCE to oversee the implementation of medical school expansion and pick <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>up on points made about clinical academics is a powerful package of measures&#151;one that will ensure that we enhance teaching research in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply and I thank noble Lords for their powerful contributions to the debate today and previously on the Bill. It seems as though the Government are taking some welcome measures, but it is a complex package with bits here and bits there. That underlines our belief that we need to have a duty on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para2"></a>We continue to believe that support for research, education and training must placed on the face of the Bill and not be allowed to become actions which "can" take place rather than "must" take place. During the passage of the Bill there have been opportunities for that change to be made but it has not happened. I therefore do not feel reassured and I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20516-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I make no apology for coming back to the issue of specialised commissioning albeit, I hope, somewhat more briefly than in our discussions on Report, but I do so in order to obtain further and better particulars from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, if he is responding. I am glad to see that he will. I recognise that the wording of the amendment may not provide the perfect vehicle for debate.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para8"></a>On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, declared that the Government were adopting a pragmatic approach to commissioning for specialised services. That was welcome, as was the information given to the House that the Minister of State, Mr Hutton, had commissioned a review with the intention of issuing guidance in the autumn on arrangements relating to the period beyond 2002-03. However, the importance of the issue and the need for national and regional commissioning merits recognition in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para9"></a>In its last report in 1999-2000, the national specialist commissioning advisory group was asked to look at regional specialist commissioning. A new report must be somewhat overdue. It remarked that a common characteristic of these low volume services and treatment was that they were often of high cost requiring specialist technical expertise and a concentration of clinical care.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para10"></a>Implementing new arrangements for such services was a key aim of the original White Paper, The New NHS: Modern, Dependable issued shortly after the Government came to power. It concluded that the internal market's fragmentation between multiple GP fundholders, as they then were, and health authorities had made it difficult to ensure properly co-ordinated commissioning arrangements for those services. A more systematic approach was needed if fair access was to be guaranteed and if clinical staff were to be supported in developing the most suitable and effective care. The new arrangements should be capable of commanding the confidence of clinical units concerned while being clearly accountable to health authorities and PCTs. I believe that those criteria are valid today. I do not believe that the <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government's current vague expressions on the way in which those arrangements will be carried out meet those criteria.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para11"></a>Let me take haemophilia as an example. Some 6,000 people are affected, costing about &#163;115 million per annum to treat. Within this total, &#163;20 million is spent on patients with inhibitors&#151;that is, resistance to treatment with Factor VIII or IX as appropriate&#151;principally in relation to the 100 or so with high titres. Immune tolerance treatment for such patients typically costs at least &#163;1 million per patient. That is a high figure. Orthopaedic procedures, such as knee or hip replacements, are also very expensive as are major spontaneous bleeds.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para12"></a>Currently, commissioning for haemophilia is arranged by health authorities or specialist consortia, not least to spread the risk of costly and largely unpredictable episodes affecting patients with inhibitors. These arrangements are by no means considered perfect and there is broad support for a national approach to commissioning. Conversely, delegation of responsibility to primary care trusts has been described by Dr Mark Winter, chairman of the Haemophilia Alliance which represents patients and clinicians, as "a catastrophe waiting to happen".
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para13"></a>I have taken one example of specialised commissioning and treatment. We must not assume that the problem will be solved if we delegate specialised commissioning to consortia of PCTs. We must consider those individual areas of specialised commissioning and decide what is appropriate for them, in particular whether national and regional commissioning are appropriate. We need clarity and accountability. We need to decide what is done at the appropriate level.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para14"></a>In referring to regional commissioning one is in a sense referring to strategic health authorities in the context of the Bill&#151;although I regret it&#151;but clearly there needs to be expertise and reference at the strategic health authority level if we are satisfactorily to have the expertise to commission some of these services.
<P>

<a name="20516-06_para15"></a>The debate is perhaps a reprise but slightly more concrete in some respects. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, in moving the amendment, the noble Lord outlined why specialised services are a matter of great concern in the NHS. These Benches support the thrust of the amendment. It ensures that the commissioning of specialised services is done at the right level in the NHS. We believe that that is the correct direction although the amendment may not be in quite the right form.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para0"></a>Highly developed skills for the commissioning of specialised services exist at regional level. I refer to the eight old regions, not the four virtual regions which are being created. The regional specialised commissioning groups ensure that patients have specialised services available to them and the providers of those services have the funding, security and stability which allows them to develop those services.
<P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para1"></a>Pure dogma has driven the Government to propose the break up of those regional groups and to devolve commissioning responsibility to PCTs. PCTs demonstrably do not have the confidence to handle specialised commissioning even if&#151;and it is a big "if"&#151;they have a commitment to specialised commissioning. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Joint Consultants Committee issued a press release saying that it is very worried about specialised commissioning given the lack of readiness of PCTs. This is not a problem that will go away despite the many assurances and expressions of confidence that we have had from the Front Bench opposite.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para2"></a>Has the Minister ever heard of the management maxim, "If it ain't broke don't fix it"? No, the Government's approach is to break it first and then try to fix it. At a stroke the Government will smash the eight regional arrangements into 300 PCT-sized bits which do not work. They will then rearrange them into 28 strategic health authority-sized networks which might work if they are performance managed&#151;but we have no evidence on which to be sure. If noble Lords have ever wondered what nonsense on stilts looks like, this is it.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para3"></a>At Report stage the Minister gave us a glimmer of hope when he referred to the possibility that regional specialised commissioning groups will continue beyond 2002&#150;03. He said that it may well be that they will not be dismantled. We were heartened to hear both that and the review proposed by Mr Hutton. Perhaps I may put a couple of questions to the Minister about Mr Hutton's review? Will he say a little more about it, who will be involved in the review and whether it will seek out the views of the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group of specialised service providers throughout the country and, importantly, the view of patients? Will he commit to making public the review and the evidence obtained for it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, in my naivety I thought that on Report I had made everyone, if not totally content, substantially satisfied, about the queries. Clearly, I was premature on that.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para4"></a>As we know, specialised services are those where patient numbers are small and quality can only be achieved by bringing together a critical mass of patients in each centre. This means that there will be relatively few centres offering treatment and there will not be a specialist centre in every local hospital. Therefore, PCTs acting in isolation could not deliver the quality and cost effectiveness which we all believe is essential for the future.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para5"></a>However, under shifting the balance of power, primary care trusts are responsible for commissioning health services for their local populations. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked whether I had ever heard of the quotation, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". Yes, indeed. What is "broke" is the current centralisation of the NHS, on the basis that all of its functions and products can be run on the old command and control model from Whitehall. That is why we believe it is right to establish PCTs, which are <P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much better and more in touch and have a greater understanding of the needs of the public and patients and can take a wide and long view of how best to meet those needs. That is why we believe it fundamentally right to make sure that one did not half-bake devolution to them, but gave them full budgetary responsibility as far as it is practicable and sensible to do so.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para6"></a>We believe that that is a much better approach&#151;although it will require joint working between PCTs to deal with joint commissioning&#151;than to have some rather arbitrary definition, inevitably by central government, about which functions should be dealt with at a different level from PCTs. The thrust of the Government's approach is to devolve, but to set very clear outcomes and standards to be achieved rather than to second guess the mechanisms in detail.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para7"></a>However, I sought to signal in the last debate that we recognise the importance of getting it and the process of development and evolution right rather than suddenly throwing it all up in the air. PCTs both now and in the future will be expected to work together on a consortium basis to secure specialised services. That will certainly be true immediately and it is likely to be true for many functions for the future. In the short term they will be expected to honour existing agreements, financial and otherwise, negotiated by regional specialist commissioning groups. Those groups will continue for at least a further year with PCTs replacing the former health authority members. RSCGs have a specific role in developing PCT capacity to commission specialised services as part of a planned transition to successor arrangements. Ensuring that enough people with the right skills continue in their roles is particularly important in the context of specialised services.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para8"></a>As I believe I indicated last time, there are already encouraging reports of PCTs working together to ensure that specialised services are effectively commissioned. Sometimes these consortia cover populations the size of a strategic health authority and sometime larger populations.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para9"></a>As noble Lords have implied already from the slightly hesitant way in which they signalled that this was a probing amendment, the role of strategic health authorities will be to oversee the consortia arrangements with regional directors of health and social care, ensuring that specialised services are delivered properly across the whole region. Strategic health authorities are not there to commission services, as the amendment suggests.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para10"></a>The amendment also refers to very highly specialised services which are vulnerable for some reason. They will continue to be centrally commissioned under the auspices of the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group. But such arrangements are only suitable for those very highly specialised services where there are a handful of providers and perhaps a couple of hundred patients across the whole country. This is not the case for most specialised services.
<P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para11"></a>I also indicated that while there is a clear national list now, that will change over time as technology changes. However, that is not to imply that we see a case for a rapid expansion in any way of the list of functions currently handled by the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para12"></a>The Government are adopting the pragmatic approach to commissioning and I believe that has been acknowledged. Current commissioning arrangements will be left alone where they are working well. The experience of PCTs, when they are essentially funding and supporting the new arrangements, will have to make a case both to each other and in practice to the SHA for any significant change to those commissioning arrangements. So it is not a carte blanche situation, being completely free to throw away good practice and common sense.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para13"></a>We have considered further the valid points made by noble Lords during the passage of the Bill. I would like to add emphasis to the review headed by my right honourable friend, John Hutton, into specialised services and the commission arrangements, in particular for the regional-type services covered by several strategic health authorities, with a view to issuing guidance in the autumn on arrangements beyond 2002/3.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para14"></a>The review will canvas views as to how best to integrate the current regional specialised commissioning group arrangements with the new health and social care regional boundaries in order to ensure that highly specialised services covering large geographic areas are properly planned, funded and monitored. It will be a wide review. We shall be interested to hear views from any organisation in the health service which has concerns, interests or issues relevant to the review's terms of reference. I emphasise that those views should be submitted.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, gave a specific example of haemophiliacs. He touched on a point which we did not go into in much detail on the last occasion concerning the consortia arrangements. While they are fundamentally concerned to deal with the need to commission over larger-scale populations, they are also a means of sharing risk so that there is no postcode lottery in the future. Therefore, any PCT which might, for example, have a sudden movement into its area of a number of people unfortunate enough to be really high-cost haemophiliacs, would not thereby have its budget skewed, damaged or put at risk other patients. That was a very legitimate concern raised by the noble Lord. That is why joint arrangements will also be put in place, not just for commissioning, but to pool risk.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para16"></a>There is a good example already of a highly successful haemophiliac service commission consortium in south-east England covering over 80 PCTs and a population of 13 million, with financial risk-sharing arrangements. So I am not speaking just from theory, but from practice. Clearly, when one finds such examples one wants to ensure that they are assessed and the good practice is retailed to others, where appropriate.
<P>


<a name="column_447"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para17"></a>I hope that I can reassure noble Lords that the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group will continue doing its valuable work in relation to the very highly specialist services. But it is right that the primary care trusts should commission other specialist services under the careful scrutiny of strategic health authorities. PCTs will have the best knowledge of the needs of their population and are best placed to provide for their needs, in some cases in isolation, but in many cases working in firm consortia arrangements with others. For these reasons we resist the amendment as we believe that it is not necessary.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Quite clearly, from the Minister's reply I believe that further torture of him has produced results at Third Reading. I thank him in particular for the point he made about the pooling of risk in the way in which the consortia are constructed. There is a flaw, however. Only time will tell how matters work out in terms of the logic of some of the Government's proposals in this area. I refer to the blanket view that all centralisation is bad and that decentralisation is good for all purposes. That is the initial ground on which one stands.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para18"></a>As a federalist, I have always believed that devolution is best done to the appropriate level. It is not always a question of saying that everything must be pushed down to the lowest possible level. The appropriate level is where the expertise and resources are best deployed. That is the problem that we shall have to address in the future.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para19"></a>I accept the Minister's assurances about the ambit of Mr Hutton's review and in particular about the level of consultation that will be invited from all bodies in terms of the way in which the consultation is conducted. However, there is a lot more water to flow under the bridge. We very much hope&#151;a hope shared by those on other Benches&#151;that the regional groups will be retained as we believe that they fulfil a proper and useful function. We shall be looking at where the expertise properly resides; at the performance management and assessment carried out by the strategic health authorities; and in particular cases at whether or not a specialised piece of commissioning has been carried out at the appropriate level.
<P>

<a name="20516-07_para20"></a>For the moment, we are content to examine the Minister's reply and to hold him to account at a future date. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20516-08_para6"></a>Amendment No. 26 delivers the commitment that I made on Report that the NHS Appointments Commission will be responsible for appointing the chair of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. But we go further&#151;demonstrating that we are committed to the independence of the commission and distancing the appointments process from the Secretary of State. These amendments enable the Secretary of State to delegate to the NHS Appointments Commission such of his functions as may be appropriate in relation to the tenure of office, terms of appointment, dismissal and so on of the chair and members. The details of how such arrangements with the NHS Appointments Commission might work in practice are still subject to discussion with the chair of the commission and his team.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para7"></a>We have also been persuaded that similar arrangements should be made for the appointment of the chair of the Commission for Health Improvement. <P>


<a name="column_449"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 449</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Secretary of State will now have the power to direct a special health authority to appoint the chair and members of the commission. This power will extend also to the Assembly and the appointment of its member.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para8"></a>Dame Deirdre Hine has announced that she does not intend to seek reappointment. I should like to take this opportunity to place on record my gratitude and that of the Government for the key personal contribution that she has made to the development of the commission.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para9"></a>Through Amendment No. 4, the next chair will be appointed by the independent NHS Appointments Commission. This anticipates arrangements to be made for the new health inspectorate, as was recently announced by the Secretary of State. Again, my right honourable friend will be able to delegate to the NHS Appointments Commission his decision-making powers in regulations relating to the appointment and tenure of office.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para10"></a>I believe that these amendments follow the discussions that we had at previous stages. I very much hope that noble Lords will accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, we greatly appreciate the amendments that the Minister has brought forward in relation both to the CHI and to the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. We are glad that he has agreed with us.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para11"></a>Perhaps I may ask the Minister one question. Why are the amendments phrased in terms of directing "a special health authority" to carry out the appointments and functions of the Secretary of State? Given the wording, that could be any special health authority&#151;for example, it could be NICE or any other NHS body; I probably do not even know the current list of bodies which are special health authorities. Why does not the Bill simply mention the NHS Appointments Commission?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I can&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister wishes to respond at the end, that would seem to be convenient. Perhaps I may just insert my twopenny-worth into the proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para12"></a>I welcome not only the amendments but also the assurances that the Minister gave. Otherwise, we should spend many happy hours debating "may" and "shall", as we have on other occasions. In particular, these are important for the independence of the CHI and the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. I suspect that the Minister may have set a precedent for discussion of future health Bills. But as an opening of the door to greater independence for these two bodies, this sets an excellent precedent and runs counter to previous legislation to quite a degree.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para13"></a>I associate myself with the Minister's warm words about Dame Deirdre Hine. She has done a splendid job. There may have been a difference of approach in the way in which the CHI has been run in terms of its <P>


<a name="column_450"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developmental role. However, the Minister has explained that on a previous occasion. I believe that a rather different role is envisaged for the CHI in future but that does not detract at all from the way in which it has been a resounding success in its first period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the word "direct" is used as opposed to "delegate". Does that mean that the direction cannot be revoked afterwards without primary legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   No, my Lords. The Secretary of State has the power of direction, and I suppose that what he directs he may "un-direct".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may put a brief question to the Minister. Subsection (2) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The National Assembly for Wales may direct a Special Health Authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-08_para14"></a>
I understood at an earlier stage of the Bill that the health authorities in Wales are to be called "health authorities", not "special health authorities". It is simply a matter for clarification. The intention of the amendments is most welcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, my understanding in relation to the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is that, clearly, the NHS Appointments Commission will do the appointing. But because the NHS Act itself does not provide for the National Health Service Appointments Commission we could not now place it on the face. It is a special health authority. When the Secretary of State makes a direction, clearly that responsibility will be given to the NHS Appointments Commission. But the appointments commission was set up by secondary legislation. That is why the amendment is termed in the way it is.

<a name="20516-08_para18"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6 to 9 and 11 to 15.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para19"></a>On Report, I suggested to the Government that if they intended to be consistent about patient and public involvement and give full recognition of the growing role of the private and voluntary sectors in delivering healthcare to NHS patients, there was one important way in which the arrangements in the Bill needed to be buttressed; namely, by ensuring that the functions of a patients forum could be extended to every location in which publicly funded care was delivered. It is no good to an NHS patient if he finds that having been moved <P>


<a name="column_451"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to, say, a private care home to recuperate from an operation, he cannot then access the local patients forum if he needs to do so.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para20"></a>Similarly, if the acute trust looking after our old friend, Mrs Archibald, decides to send her to a local private hospital to have her operation, why should she be suddenly cut off from the trust's patients forum? When considering the provision of mental health services of the significant proportion of NHS patients who are treated in the private sector, what is the argument against making sure that such patients in privately run treatment centres have exactly the same guarantee of representation as they would have in an NHS facility?
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para21"></a>I know that the Minister is sympathetic to that argument, but his main rejoinder last time was to say that the amendments were superfluous because when the NHS contracts with independent providers, the inspection rights of patients forums will be set out in the relevant contract. That is fine as long as the contract covers the issue. Experience of the past few years shows that it is sometimes very difficult to get health authorities to insert such arrangements into their contracts, despite departmental guidance to that effect. Even if we take it as read that visiting rights have been included in a particular contract, how can those rights be enforced? The patients forum itself will not be a party to the contract.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para22"></a>I agree with what the Minister said on Report, namely, that with the NHS becoming a much larger purchaser of services within the private sector, the rights of inspection should feature more prominently and perhaps more automatically in contract negotiations. But, for the reasons that I have given, I do not think that that is good enough. As I said on Report, the Bill places very specific duties on patients forums. Clause 15(2)(a) states that they must
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"monitor and review the operation of services"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-08_para23"></a>
and Clause 15(2)(b) states that they must
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"obtain the views of patients".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-08_para24"></a><P>

<a name="20516-08_para25"></a>Patients forums should not have to be dependent on the vagaries of a contract to fulfil those duties.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para26"></a>The other matter covered by the amendments relates to overview and scrutiny committees, which ought to be able to scrutinise services delivered to NHS patients in whatever setting those patients are being looked after. The Minister helpfully said on Report that he would consider the issue. I understand his point that the remit of OSCs covers NHS bodies that may or may not agree contracts with the private sector. I am not sure that it is possible for an OSC to engage in the proper scrutiny of services unless it can call the provider of those services directly to account. That should be part and parcel of the deal that the private service provider enters into in exchange for accepting NHS patients.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para27"></a>I hope that the Minister will be reasonably sympathetic to these probing amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on Amendments Nos. 5 to 9 and 11 to 15. To some extent, there is a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu about our debates. The Minister may recall that we had very similar debates when we discussed the inspection powers of CHI, which seems like a long time ago but was probably three or four years ago, during the passage of the Health Act 1999. At that time, we said that it was utterly logical for CHI, as the audit and inspection body being set up at the time, to cover not only NHS facilities but private facilities as well. The case is even stronger and more cogent now as services will be commissioned by the health service and not only private health care is involved.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para28"></a>We know from the stated plans of the Secretary of State that it is intended that the NHS should have flexibility to commission the NHS internally or, as seems to be more and more likely, from the private sector, and even from overseas, so flexibility is being built into the system.
<P>

<a name="20516-08_para29"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made the case extremely well. He referred to the vagaries of contracts, and as a lawyer, I agree that that is absolutely true&#151;indeed, more so than he can say. The contents of a contract depend on the bargaining power of the parties. If it is a distress purchase, commissioned by a health trust that has to buy care very quickly from a specialist provider, it will be in no position to insist on very much. It may have a degree of leverage on the price but I doubt that it will have much leverage on whether there should be powers of inspection for the patients forum. Leaving it to the parties to decide the contents of the contract sounds to me, as a lawyer, an extremely faulty way of going about things. The issue would be far better expressed in legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend the Minister has given serious consideration to the amendments. The Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have said many times that the private sector will be brought in increasingly to provide services that were formerly provided by the National Health Service. It, therefore, seems completely logical that patients and citizens should be able to comment on such services through patients forums and scrutiny committees. If not, how will those services be monitored? Will withdrawal of the contract be the only discipline available? That is not desirable as the services will be integrated by then and will be difficult to replace. I shall be very interested to hear my noble friend's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has explained very well the fragmentation that could complicate the life of patients when they are looked after in a variety of health establishments. The Minister knows the <P>


<a name="column_453"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complications of hospital infections, which need all the monitoring they can get. That is only one example of the complications that could arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I have a great deal of sympathy with the intention behind the amendments, although I do not believe that they are necessary.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para0"></a>NHS patients remain NHS patients wherever they are treated and there is no question that it is extremely important that patients forums can enter premises and inspect services. That is the Bill's intention. The difference is the legal basis that underpins the arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para1"></a>First, I remind noble Lords that it is not necessary to list care trusts as a separate entity that must allow patients forums entry rights. Care trusts are either NHS trusts or primary care trusts that have been redesignated as care trusts under Section 45 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. As such they are already provided for under the terms of Clause 17 of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para2"></a>Secondly, Clause 15(2) covers all services arranged by the trust, including those provided in independent clinics, hospitals, medical agencies or care homes, local authority care homes or directly by the NHS. Whenever NHS care is provided the service can be reviewed by patients forums as per Clause 15(2).
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para3"></a>Thirdly, NHS patients remain NHS patients wherever they are treated. As I said, it is important that patients forums are able to enter premises and inspect services. That has always been our intention. NHS bodies will be expected as a matter of course to set out rights for patients forums in the individual contacts that they agree with independent providers.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para4"></a>Both the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to contracts. I am aware that the details of such contracts have been a source of some concern to community health councils in the past. That is one of the reasons why we are currently discussing with the independent sector a set of standard terms and conditions for NHS bodies to use when drawing up contracts for acute hospital care. Naturally, in such standard terms and conditions we shall include appropriate provisions to safeguard the rights of patients forums. We shall stress the importance of those provisions in the accompanying guidance.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para5"></a>In addition, we are considering whether the patients forums' non-executive director on the trust board should be given a specific responsibility for ensuring that contracts include details of the arrangements for patients forums to exercise their functions. We shall also consider whether they should monitor arrangements for forums to review, monitor, and inspect the services provided by the trust through arrangements with non-NHS providers.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para6"></a>I acknowledge the concern to inspect nursing homes and other healthcare establishments under the Care Standards Act 2000 in order to ensure that they meet appropriate standards of care. As the National Care Standards Commission has taken over the regulation <P>


<a name="column_454"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 454</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and inspection of the bodies specified in these amendments from local authorities and from health authorities, such inspection will enable the closest attention to be paid to those private sector providers.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para7"></a>In addition, through the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, patients forums will be able to report matters of concern to the National Care Standards Commission, the Commission for Health Improvement, and any other body that they consider appropriate under Clause 20(6) of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para8"></a>As regards overview and scrutiny, I make it clear, again, that the definition of "health service" will, in any case, include services provided to NHS patients under arrangements made by a trust. It is irrelevant whether the service is provided by the trust, or under an arrangement made with an independent body. The patient remains an NHS patient, and the health aspect of the service received can be scrutinised by his or her local overview and scrutiny committee. Although the pathway is somewhat different because of the different legal basis of an NHS organisation and of an independent provider, I am satisfied that patients forums will have the ability to undertake inspections within the private sector where they are dealing with NHS patients.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that helpful reply. I am also grateful to those noble Lords who took part in this debate, not least the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who was right to point out that the bargaining power of the parties to contracts in this sort of instance will vary considerably case by case. Nevertheless, it is heartening to hear that the Government are considering the possibility of a standard form of words for such contracts. It is also helpful to know that they are thinking in terms of giving a specific role to the patients forum member sitting on the trust board to ensure that contracts do include suitable provisions.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para9"></a>However, we return to the fundamental point; namely, that when it comes to enforcement of the contract, the patients forum is in rather a difficult position because it has no locus in that respect. I very much take on board what the Minister said about overview and scrutiny committees. Again, I found his response encouraging. I take it from his remarks that the overview and scrutiny committee will be able to look at the service actually delivered to the patient&#151;the patient experience&#151;wherever that service is delivered. Therefore, it will not need to confine itself to cross-questioning the trust that commissioned that service; it can question directly those who provided the service in the private facility, whether it be a hospital or a care home.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I should clarify the position. I believe that the overview and scrutiny committee would be in a position to invite a private sector provider to appear before it. Therefore, it would be for the private sector provider to decide whether or not to accept that invitation. What is not in doubt is the fact that the arrangements made by an <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>NHS organisation for commissioning those services would be covered by the responsibility of the overview and scrutiny committee. In accordance with the legislation, the committee would be in a position to require a representative of that body to appear before it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-09_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, again, I thank the Minister for his most useful clarification.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para10"></a>As regards the National Care Standards Commission, it would be reassuring to know that a line of communication will be established between the commission and the relevant patients forum. Although the Minister mentioned the likelihood of the National Care Standards Commission wishing to report to the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, or possibly even the CHI, there is perhaps another line of communication available in this case&#151;namely, the relevant patients forum. I leave that thought with the Minister. We have had a most useful debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-09_para20"></a><P>

<a name="20516-09_para21"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 17, 18, 22 and 24. We debated these amendments on Report. They propose a duty of scrutiny for local authorities in substitution for the power of scrutiny conferred on them by the Health and Social Care Act 2001. This is an important issue. When confronted by a matter brought to their notice by a patients forum, my concern is that some local authorities may simply choose to ignore it and do nothing; either because they have other priorities, or because they do not have the necessary resources.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para22"></a>As matters stand, there is nothing in this Bill or elsewhere to ensure that patients forums will be listened to; yet scrutiny of health issues by local authorities is absolutely central to patient and public representation. It is a function currently carried out by <P>


<a name="column_456"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 456</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>CHCs. If nobody has a statutory duty to scrutinise health issues, and, where necessary, take action, patients forums will simply be left talking to a brick wall. In fact, except in the context of minor matters that can be sorted out within the narrow confines of a trust, forums will almost cease to have a point.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para23"></a>On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, argued that under the Local Government Act 2000 local authorities already have a "responsibility"&#151;I use his word&#151;to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their areas. He added:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It could not be clearer that they are responsible for promoting the health and well-being of their communities".&#151;[Official Report, 30/4/02; col. 619.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-09_para24"></a>
On those grounds the noble Lord considered my amendment unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para25"></a>As the noble Lord is aware, I took his statement to mean, first, that local authorities already have a duty to promote the health and well-being of their communities; and, secondly, that the provisions of the Local Government Act are directly relevant to the scrutiny of health issues. I withdrew my amendment on that basis.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para26"></a>Following the debate, the noble Lord was kind enough to write to me to correct my interpretation of his words. He said that when he had spoken of local authorities having a responsibility to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their areas, I should have understood him to mean that they had a power to do so. I do not think that I can be blamed completely for having interpreted the noble Lord's words as I did. However, that was a helpful clarification and I am grateful to him.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para27"></a>The other part of the noble Lord's argument was also important. I have had an opportunity to examine the Local Government Act 2000. Section 2 contains the power that I have just mentioned, and Section 4 contains a duty for a local authority to prepare a strategy for promoting or improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom. Perhaps two questions arise from that. First, given that health is not specifically mentioned in the Local Government Act at that point, can the Minister confirm that Ministers and the Department of Health have received legal advice that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"economic, social and environmental well-being"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-09_para28"></a>
in the Local Government Act subsumes health?
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para29"></a>Secondly, can he confirm that the power contained in Section 2 of the Local Government Act should be interpreted as implying a power of scrutiny of health issues? If the answer to both those questions is yes, I would find that encouraging. If it is yes, can the Minister say whether the Government are prepared to issue guidance to local authorities to make that matter clear, and whether they could incorporate guidance about the content of the strategy mentioned in Section 4 of the Local Government Act to the effect that the strategy should cover health issues as well as all the rest?
<P>


<a name="column_457"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para30"></a>What the Minister was essentially saying on Report was that my amendments were unnecessary for the reasons I have given. He was also arguing that the amendments, in so far as they created a duty, were undesirable, on the grounds that it is wrong, as he saw it, to impose duties on democratically elected bodies such as local authorities. I have reflected on that argument. I am not sure what I think of it, really. It was clearly Parliament's intention when it passed the Health and Social Care Act 2001 that local authority overview and scrutiny committees should have the function of scrutinising matters relating to health. In other words, it was not in Parliament's mind that local authorities should pay lip service to the function or that they should fail to perform it at all if they did not feel like it. The whole point of setting up overview and scrutiny committees was to ensure that the scrutiny function currently performed by CHCs should be safeguarded.
<P>

<a name="20516-09_para31"></a>I believe that we should ensure that the edifice of patient and public involvement really does stand up, which is why I am proposing this amendment. In other spheres, the Government have not been averse to imposing duties on local government&#151;witness for a start Section 4 of the Local Government Act. In a matter as important as this, I really see no reason why there should not be such a duty in order to ensure that what the Government themselves say they want really does happen. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I rise to give partial support to this group of amendments. In particular, I think that Amendment No. 16 has quite a lot to commend it in terms of seeking to ensure that overview and scrutiny committees are added to the list of bodies to which patients forums will provide information. We on these Benches believe that it will be essential for overview and scrutiny committees to receive information from patients forums in order to inform their scrutiny role. Patients forums will have useful information about the performance of individual NHS trusts and their patients' experience. We are not so convinced about the changing of a power to a duty, but the position is somewhat complicated by the Minister's previous statements about the duty already being contained in legislation. Indeed, I suspect that the LGA is in some confusion as to whether it is a duty or a power.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para0"></a>Our nervousness about the possibility of turning the power into a duty is based on whether the additional resources would be made available. We believe that local government is making efforts to ensure that there is effective overview and scrutiny. However, it is early days yet. We believe that there will be an opportunity in future health Bills&#151;we are quite sure that the House will be considering a number of health Bills before too long&#151;to tweak the legislation to ensure that, if local government is falling down in overview and scrutiny, we can rectify the matter. Nevertheless, there is nervousness about whether resources will be available if that power is turned into a duty.
<P>


<a name="column_458"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para1"></a>We therefore offer partial support for Amendment No. 16. We also rather regret the way in which the groupings have been made, particularly as regards Amendment No. 24. We are therefore prepared to accept Amendment No. 16, but not the other amendments in this group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak first to government Amendment No. 22.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para2"></a>As I have previously stated, we are committed to ensuring a robust framework representing the public's concerns to government where there is inadequate consultation over major changes and where there are concerns over the merits of proposals for change. Our lawyers have confirmed that there could be some ambiguity in the provisions in the Local Government Act, as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2001, about OSCs and their ability to refer matters to the Secretary of State for Health. In case any local authority was uncertain about whether it has the power to stick a stamp on an envelope and send its views to the Secretary of State, we think it appropriate to remove that doubt by amending the relevant provisions of the Health and Social Care Act. Amendment No. 22 does just that.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para3"></a>Amendment No. 22 makes it explicit that OSCs may make reports and recommendations to "the relevant authority"&#151;the Secretary of State, in relation to England&#151;thereby ensuring the referral framework that we think is necessary. The detail for referrals will be prescribed in regulations as is the case with the current arrangements for community health councils. I hope the House will agree that this amendment is an important one and that it is right to ensure that there is no doubt about this fundamental element of the PPI system. For OSCs to be truly powerful in delivering local accountability, they need to have the power to trigger action at Secretary of State-level if necessary. I am sure that they will do so.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para4"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 24. I have on a number of occasions made it clear that we think that it is not right to compel local authority overview and scrutiny committees to scrutinise health services through a statutory duty. Not only would that be completely out of kilter with the existing role of OSCs in other areas, but, more importantly and more critically, it is wrong to compel a democratically elected independent body to do something in this particular circumstance. I think that the implication of the amendment is that noble Lords have some doubts as to whether councillors would carry out one of their key roles&#151;that of local accountability. However, the health of the population will be a key concern for overview and scrutiny committees and their constituents as decisions affecting people's health have a direct impact on the well-being of the people who elected them. As elected representatives, they will be keen to be seen to be addressing issues that matter to their electorate. If they do not, one would expect them to suffer the consequences.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para5"></a>For this reason, the decision whether to scrutinise the NHS must rest with local people and their representatives. Given the diversity of Britain, the <P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 459</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>breadth of health issues, and the fact that judgments will have to be made about authorities, simply imposing a duty&#151;which is what I think the noble Earl, Lord Howe, wishes, and I respect his reasons for advocating it&#151;would leave open massive issues about which matters the OSCs should examine at any given time. Each year they would have to decide where scrutiny was most needed. In practice, no one can do everything all at once.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para6"></a>I turn to some of the legal issues raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I believe that I referred to both a "role" and a "responsibility". I also grant that it was not at all foolish to infer that that implied a duty rather than a power. Under Section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000, the local authority has a power to do anything it considers likely to achieve the promotion or improvement of the social, economic or environmental well-being of its area. Section 4 goes further and says that the local authority must prepare a strategy for promoting or improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of its area. There is nothing to prescribe what a local authority must consider in developing the strategy under Section 4. However, in practice and in almost all circumstances, it will develop the strategy in collaboration with others. I am sure that that has been the thrust of government advice to local authorities and to PCTs. It is therefore reasonable to expect that this will involve local authorities in considering health matters.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked about government advice to local authorities on preparing the strategies. Off the cuff I cannot recollect that. I am certain that such advice has already been given. Whether it includes advice explicitly about liaison with the health service I do not know but we shall check that. In any event, were it not to do so, it is a point that we would consider for future issues of such guidance.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para8"></a>The Local Government Act 2000 goes further. Section 21(2) gives overview and scrutiny committees a broad advisory role in relation to functions of the whole authority and matters affecting the locality. OSCs have the power to review, scrutinise and make reports and recommendations in relation to matters set out in Section 21(2). By virtue of Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, the power of the OSC includes a power to review, scrutinise and make reports and recommendations on matters relating to health.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para9"></a>The noble Lord also referred to concerns about implementation. We are currently halfway through a national consultation on the policy framework. Draft regulations and guidance will be prepared during the summer. We shall consult on those around September. It is envisaged that the new provisions will come into force in late 2002 with a full training and implementation programme to assist the roll-out. CHCs in particular are to be involved in the development of the implementation plan.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para10"></a>With regard to the view of local government, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, may have mentioned this matter previously but the LGA, in briefing it circulated when the Bill was in Committee, <P>


<a name="column_460"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognised the need for OSCs to carry out health scrutiny&#151;which I hope gives some comfort to the noble Earl, Lord Howe&#151;but did not want this power to be a duty. I believe that I signalled that issues of resources would form part of the discussions and negotiations between the LGA and central government in terms of the level of expenditure and grant that would be considered appropriate in future.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para11"></a>I refer to the dalliance of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, with Amendment No. 16, with regard to whether OSCs should have a duty to give information to patients forums. One hopes that they will so behave. However, if we are resistant to imposing a duty of the type that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggests, the logic is that we would also resist imposing a duty on them with regard to giving information to patients forums. That measure will occur in practice if local government and the health service promote it vigorously and learn from experience and try to learn from good practice in local authorities that do that well. That is what needs to happen. I do not think that changing the words in the Bill would make a fundamental difference to that. For those reasons, we resist Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 while standing four square with the noble Lord and the noble Earl as regards the importance of making sure that local government seizes this significant role and tries to ensure that it is carried out to the benefit of the public.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-10_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is always courteous and helpful in his responses and I am grateful to him on this occasion as on others. He made two comments that I considered particularly helpful. First, he referred to Section 21 of the Local Government Act 2000. I understood him to say that that section contains a power to scrutinise health services. I was not aware of that and it is a helpful clarification. Secondly, the noble Lord helpfully referred to guidance to local authorities. I am grateful for his undertaking to look again at what guidance has been issued.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para12"></a>I am sorry obviously that my arguments have not won the day. The argument with regard to imposing duties on local authorities is perhaps a stronger one than the noble Lord would have us think. It is interesting that the Greater London Authority Act 1999 has a provision at Section 34 to impose a duty on the GLA to exercise all its powers in a way best calculated to promote the health of Londoners. I am not sure why there is thought to be such a difference of principle as regards this Bill and as regards a general duty for local authorities. However, we have made progress on that issue. I am grateful for the noble Lord's comments.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para13"></a>I welcome government Amendment No. 22. It comes rather at the eleventh hour, but better late than never. I shall have more to say about that amendment later in today's proceedings. I am disappointed that it is framed in the way that it is as I think that it could be stronger. It seems to me that it is not the same to say that a local authority can make reports to the Secretary <P>


<a name="column_461"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of State as to say that it has a right of referral. A right of referral is a much more robust and clearer arrangement. The matter remains a little wishy-washy. I accept gratefully what has been offered&#151;I certainly do not object to what the Government propose&#151;but I shall return to the matter later. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-10_para14"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020516/text/20516-11.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-11_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 26, line 15, after "bodies" insert "or persons"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-11_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20516-11_para1"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, at Report stage the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, tabled an amendment the purpose of which was to broaden the functions of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health by giving it the unfettered role of representing the interests of patients and the wider community. It was an important amendment which went to a Division and was defeated. I have not sought to bring back those particular issues at Third Reading. I have instead tabled Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 which are narrower in scope. Specifically they are designed to extend the matters upon which the commission is permitted to make representations and to widen the audience, as it were, of those to whom it is allowed to speak.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para2"></a>We can see in subsection (2)(a) of Clause 20 that the commission has the function of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"advising the Secretary of State, and such bodies as may be prescribed, about arrangements for public involvement in, and consultation on, matters relating to the health service in England".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-11_para3"></a>
In other words, the commission's functions are all about process. The rest of the clause continues in that vein. What the commission does not appear to be about is the experiences of real patients or the configuration of health services. That, for me, is a missed trick. At the moment CHCs and their national body, ACHCEW, can carry out a wide variety of activities. They can brief the press about hospital closures or policy changes affecting the health service. Another thing they can do is brief Members of both Houses of Parliament about issues relating to patient representation. It is no secret that ACHCEW has briefed me for this Bill and has done so very well. If the Government are serious about having a national body which is there to support the empowerment of patients&#151;and that is what the commission is supposed to be about&#151;surely to goodness it has to be allowed to do more than just comment to the Secretary of State about the arrangements in place to deliver that empowerment. This whole exercise should not just be about structures and processes; it should be about what matters to patients, and the commission should be allowed to speak out publicly on any matter if it wishes to.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para4"></a>The scope of these amendments is much more restricted than the one that was defeated at Report stage. I am not now proposing an unfettered power because the amendments would in fact allow the Secretary of State to decide exactly how the <P>


<a name="column_462"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commission should operate. But when it comes to the matters where the commission has a legal standing, I do think that we need to progress beyond the scope of subsection (2) and the relatively narrow set of issues detailed in subsection (6)&#151;the safety and welfare of patients. We need a body that can speak out on matters that bear upon the health service more generally. Again, I think of exercises such as Casualty Watch or speaking out on a particular PFI project. Why should it not be allowed to do such things? The danger, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said on Report, is that once the commission's permitted activities are set in stone in the Bill, any attempt to stray beyond them will technically be ultra vires. We should build in an element of flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister will treat these amendments more kindly than the amendment that we debated on Report. They are intended to be helpful. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I regret the fact that the amendment tabled on Report was not agreed to. I assure the Minister that these amendments are not the previous amendments in a different guise. They are much more limited in their extent and would, as the noble Earl explained, simply widen the subject matter on which the commission can make representations.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para6"></a>Without the amendment, as the noble Earl explained, the commission would be restricted to making representations about the arrangements for patient and public involvement, as opposed to the issues that really affect people's health and health services. In view of the information that the commission will be amassing, it would be a waste to have such a body if it was not able to make representations to the Secretary of State and others on the issues that really matter. That would leave patients and the public effectively without a voice on health services at national level.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para7"></a>As the noble Earl explained, ACHEW is currently able to draw on the information, experience and expertise of CHCs and its own research to inform what it says or asks for&#151;indeed, campaigns for&#151;at the national level. Recent examples include: changes in investment in accident and emergency services, which was a result of its regular "casualty watch" survey; debates on charging for NHS services, which were stimulated by its recent report, A tax on illness; and the representations that it is currently making on patient confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para8"></a>The amendments would allow the commission to take up such issues at the national level; it would otherwise be prohibited from doing that. It should be noted, however, as the noble Earl pointed out, that the commission will still be restricted to making representations to bodies and persons who are prescribed by the Secretary of State. If the Minister would state which bodies and persons he envisages the Secretary of State prescribing, we should all find that <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely useful. We are keen to ensure that the commission can make representations to the media, politicians and so on if it feels that that is appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I want to ask one question, which I have asked on several occasions but to which I have not received an answer. Is there going to be a body that can put forward people's views on the closure of hospitals? CHCs have been able to do that.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_time0"></a><H5>5.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I must apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham; I thought that I had answered that question on several occasions. The role of the CHC in relation to significant changes of services is being transferred from appointed bodies&#151;the CHCs&#151;to democratic local government. The overview and scrutiny committee of the principal local authority in an area, which is democratically elected, will deal with those issues. It will have the right to call in officers of NHS bodies to examine them. If there is disagreement on a proposal, that can be referred to a national body, the Independent Reconfiguration Panel, which will advise the Secretary of State. Far from dissipating the current mechanism, we have strengthened it by linking it to locally elected councils.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para9"></a>I accept that the amendments are worded differently from those that we debated on Report. However, they cover much the same ground. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, clearly hark for some national body to focus on representing what might be the views of patients. The noble Earl referred to their attempts to speak out. That misreads the whole purpose of the commission.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para10"></a>Subsection (2)(a) clearly states that it will advise the Secretary of State,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and such bodies as may be prescribed, about arrangements for public involvement in, and consultation on, matters relating to the health service in England".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-11_para11"></a>
The principal aim in that regard is to ensure that we get patient and public involvement right. I do not believe that the public interest would best be served if such a commission allowed itself to go down the track of having a representative role, which we know cannot be carried out by such an appointed body. That is why I resisted the amendments on Report.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para12"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, underestimated the commission's functions. He described that as involving a rather process-oriented set of roles. Paragraphs (a) to (h) in Clause 20(2) contain a very powerful set of responsibilities, which will ensure that we get public and patient involvement right. I draw his attention in particular to paragraph (d), which refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"providing assistance to Patients' Forums and Patients' Councils, and facilitating the co-ordination of their activities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-11_para13"></a>
The commission has the potential to help local patients' forums by pulling together their activities, which will enable patients' forums to work together. <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>When a number of patients' forums wish to come together over various issues, the commission will help and enhance that process. That is a much better approach. It involves using experience at the local level&#151;helping patients' forums to come together to express views on patients' experience and thinking rather than seeking at a national level to carry out a role that I do not believe such bodies can be expected to carry out effectively.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para14"></a>I point out to the noble Earl that Clause 20(3) gives the commission the function of promoting,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the involvement of members of the public in England in consultations or processes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-11_para15"></a>
The arrangement is not focused solely at prescribed bodies. The commission has a much wider role&#151;to examine the way in which individuals' involvement in the National Health Service can be enhanced and developed. It is much better for the commission to focus on helping to ensure that we get effective public involvement rather than being side-tracked by attempting to have a representational role that I do not believe it could carry out effectively.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-11_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister, although I am disappointed by what he said. I took great care to frame the amendments in such a way that they did not replicate the amendment that was defeated on Report. It would not have been proper to raise the same issues.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para16"></a>The whole point of these amendments is to give the Secretary of State the option of broadening the functions of the commission&#151;the areas of activity in which it can engage. I do not belittle the functions listed in Clause 20(2). Broadly speaking, the commission is an enabler, which will assist patients' forums and communicate with the Secretary of State. I understand that that is a very important role. But for whom will it speak? I do not believe that it will speak for patients. That is the source of my disappointment. It will speak for the bodies, structures and processes that represent patients, which is at one remove from the coal face.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para17"></a>I understand the Minister's reluctance at this point to confer on the commission what he termed "a representative role". Again, I say that I took care not to be prescriptive in these amendments. If they were accepted, it would be entirely up to the Secretary of State to determine the extent to which the commission should widen the scope of its activities. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, listed a number of subject areas which I considered to be very relevant in that context.
<P>

<a name="20516-11_para18"></a>I wanted to stand here with a clear conscience in speaking to the amendments and to convey to the House that I believed they were substantively different from the amendments that we debated and rejected on Report. I believe that I can do so. For that reason, I feel that I can take the opinion of the House.

It is, in a real sense, consequential upon the amendments carried on Report in relation to patients councils. In line with those amendments, I believe that it makes sense for the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health to operate with reference to the boundaries of local authorities which have overview and scrutiny committees.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para3"></a>That will not always be possible, but if the object is for the commission to provide support to OSCs for their scrutiny function, then it must be desirable for the commission to operate on all fours with patients councils, with which it will be intimately bound up. Clearly, in an area where there is, for example, a large county overview and scrutiny committee, there may be a need, following local discussion, to operate with reference to a smaller area. My amendment allows for that. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20516-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am not entirely convinced that now is the right time to debate <P>


<a name="column_467"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this issue. My understanding of the amendment passed on Report establishing patients' councils was that the intention was that the councils would take over the functions of the commission at the local level. In Clause 16(4)(a) it is made clear that it will be the function of the patients' council to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"facilitate the co-ordination of the activities of member Patients' Forums including by the provision of staff and services to Patients' Forums".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-12_para4"></a>
I am not clear why the noble Earl thought it important to debate this issue at this stage. I believe that an important element of the Government's proposal is that wherever possible the focus of patient involvement should be at the local level. Surely that means, as far as the health service is concerned, that it will be most appropriately placed in the primary care trust area.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para5"></a>I suspect that the other place will have something to say about patients' councils and your Lordships may be able to debate this matter again fairly shortly. Perhaps we should return to this debate at that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-12_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the Minister feels that way. If we are to have patients' councils, as I hope, it no longer makes sense for the commission to operate within the relatively narrow purview of a PCT. The Minister said that his understanding was that the patients' councils would take over the functions of the CPPI. I do not completely hold with his choice of words. The commission will still have a role. Effectively, it will act as the secretariat to patients' councils, an extremely important role. Nevertheless, de facto I believe that if we have patients' councils the commission will have to operate by reference to overview and scrutiny committees because that is the way in which patients' councils, by and large, will be configured. I am sorry that the Minister does not feel that he can accept the amendment. In the circumstances I shall not press it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20516-12_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the arrangements for patient and public involvement concern one matter and one matter alone: accountability. There are two strands to the way in which accountability works, depending on whereabouts in the hierarchy of responsibility action is initiated. Action is initiated either at the top, in which case there has to be consultation at national and at strategic level with local communities, or it is initiated at local level. At local level there are often powers to trigger action at a national level. In those cases there needs to be a right of referral upwards from local communities to national and strategic level.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para11"></a>This amendment, which has been debated on earlier occasions, seeks to preserve those lines of accountability to ensure that national accountability for what happens locally is not compromised. The advent of strategic health authorities, as branch offices of the NHS, means that they must be built into the mechanisms as well. On many occasions the Government have said that overview and scrutiny committees will have rights of referral as robust as those held by CHCs. With great respect to the Minister, at the moment that is not the situation. As I have indicated on previous occasions, the right of <P>


<a name="column_469"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>referral between local communities and the national government is absent from the Bill and from the Health and Social Care Act. That omission needs to be rectified.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para12"></a>I am delighted that the Minister has tabled Amendment No. 22. That amendment will give overview and scrutiny committees an explicit power to make reports and recommendations to the Secretary of State. However, I do not believe that that amendment is an adequate substitute for the one that we are now debating. I am seeking a robust replacement for the referral powers of CHCs, which is a much wider and a more significant matter. The government amendment gives only a permissive power to overview and scrutiny committees to make referrals. The wording of the relevant part of my amendment stipulates that referring such matters should be mandatory. That wording replicates the wording of the regulations that cover CHC referrals. It is a significant point and there is a significant difference.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para13"></a>We can all too easily imagine a situation where an OSC may be aware of flawed plans or flawed consultations about an important change to the provision of services, yet choose not to refer them, perhaps&#151;dare I say&#151;for political reasons. I touched upon that point at the previous stage of the Bill. To put it mildly, that would not be a satisfactory state of affairs. The word "referral" carries the implication, to my mind, of a two-way dialogue. My amendment puts a statutory responsibility on the Secretary of State to provide a full and timely reply to whatever may be referred to him. That is how proper accountability should work. Making reports and recommendations, as under the government amendment, does not imply that a response is required in the same way as a referral does.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para14"></a>On the face of the Bill we already have a right of referral by patients' forums to overview and scrutiny committees. If we compare that right with the terms of Amendment No. 22 we can see that it is more robust than the referral mechanism&#151;if I can call it that&#151;from local to national level. I ask why that should be.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para15"></a>Subsection (4) is an attempt to achieve those aims. It also requires the Secretary of State and care trusts to consult. That is especially relevant to specialised commissioning, where currently only the hotch-potch of PCTs will consult. Also, if a Secretary of State ever proposed to abolish a strategic health authority, it would be unreasonable for it to be expected to consult on its own demise. The Secretary of State ought to do that. That illustrates that it is not just health services that can trigger consultation, as the Minister implied earlier. I include care trusts again, not withstanding the Minister's reply last time, because it is far from clear whether a care trust would consider a duty to consult as applying to it once it was established as a new body. It is better to place the matter beyond doubt.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para16"></a>The amendment also requires consultation by strategic health authorities with local communities about the transfer of functions to PCTs. That would be important, for example, where a PCT was not ready to <P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take on such functions and the local community wanted a say in the matter. Last time, the Minister said that the provision in subsection (3) of the new clause was unnecessary, but without it PCTs may be given a completely different remit from the one for which they were established without any consultation. That would be entirely unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="20516-12_para17"></a>Last time, the Minister said that he thought that the amendment would overcomplicate the Bill. I hope that I have shown that that is not so and that there are good reasons for every ingredient in it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I support Amendment No. 23, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We welcome government Amendment No. 22 so far as it goes but, like the noble Earl, we believe that it does not go far enough. We make the same distinction as did the noble Earl between reports and referrals, referrals being a much more active process requiring a reply from the body to which the referral has been made.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para0"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, put a gloss on the Minister's reply on Report. I shall not repeat the points that he made about care trusts, but he did not put a gloss on some of the Minister's other replies, which it may be helpful for me to take the Minister through. First, care trusts should be specified because there is doubt about whether they are included.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para1"></a>Secondly, the Minister said of subsection (1) of the new clause that it would be only "cosmetic" to include the Secretary of State under the duty to consult because of shifting the balance of power, and so on and so forth. The reason for including the Secretary of State is so that he is forced to put in place appropriate arrangements for consultation on specialised or regional services. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, did not deal with that angle. For example, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, it would be unrealistic to expect a strategic health authority to consult on its own demise if that was proposed by the Secretary of State. That is a strong point that I re-emphasise.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para2"></a>The Minister said that subsection (2) was covered by the government amendment relating to consultation orders for strategic health authorities. He will note that subsection (2) of this new clause goes considerably wider. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, touched on subsection (3). I shall not repeat what he said.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para3"></a>On Report, the Minister said of subsection (4) and the issue of OSCs not having the right to refer:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are considering how best to provide for this within the framework of Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-13_para4"></a>
We have dealt with that today, but I hope that it will become clearer. After all, the Minister and his colleague, Hazel Blears, have been considering that since the beginning of the Bill's passage. The Minister said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we shall be able to guarantee that a secure referral mechanism exists within our provisions".&#151;[Official Report, 30/4/02; col.636]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-13_para5"></a>
We welcome Amendment No. 22 on that basis.
<P>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para6"></a>The Minister summarised Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 as providing for people's views and concerns to be "fed into decisions". That is quite different from consultation on substantive issues.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para7"></a>So the Minister did not deal adequately with the points that I and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised. Several aspects of the new clause would be hugely beneficial to the Bill and I hope that he will take the time and trouble to respond to all of them.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_time0"></a><H5>6.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, as noble Lords have recognised, we dealt with one of the issues that the amendment attempts to address under Amendment No. 22. I hope that that does not raise too high an expectation of further concessions.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para8"></a>Our amendment gives OSCs an explicit power to refer matters of concern to the Secretary of State&#151;as we said, to put the matter beyond doubt&#151;and subsection (4) of the new clause is intended to strengthen the mechanism for getting the views of OSCs, among others, to the Secretary of State. However, there is no benefit in making the further changes suggested in subsection (4). In fact, to do so would overcomplicate and muddle the arrangements. I shall seek to explain why.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para9"></a>Amendment No. 22 did not deal with the other aspects of Amendment No. 23&#151;namely, the changes to the duty on the NHS to make arrangements to consult and involve the public in its decisions. Again, the amendment is unnecessary. It is unnecessary to include care trusts because, as we have said several times, PCTs and NHS trusts are already listed and care trusts will be either PCTs or NHS trusts. They cannot be anything other than one of those two, so they are already explicitly caught and provided for in the way in which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, wants. They will already be covered by the references to PCTs and NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para10"></a>Secondly, with regard to the Secretary of State, shifting the balance of power to the front line means that responsibility for the planning development and delivery of services is now with the front line. It would be inconsistent then to place a duty on the Secretary of State when the duty is already in place for local bodies&#151;those bodies with responsibility for the services and the relationship with local people to be able to carry out the involvement and consultation activity.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para11"></a>Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, which was referred to, already places a duty on NHS bodies, including strategic health authorities, to consult on services for which they are responsible. Including the Secretary of State under that duty makes only a cosmetic difference.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para12"></a>Subsection (2) of the new clause relates to the Secretary of State consulting bodies representing local patients on the establishment orders of NHS bodies. As noble Lords will know, we have already amended the Bill to cover the consultation of relevant bodies on <P>


<a name="column_472"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the establishment orders of strategic health authorities. Subsection (3), which places a duty on strategic health authorities to consult before directing PCTs to undertake their statutory duties surely gives rise to major consultation overload. We would be in danger of so much consultation as to make the process meaningless.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para13"></a>Although we recognise that the new clause attempts to clarify and rationalise the consultation arrangements, it goes far too far in its detail and perhaps muddles the arrangements already provided for.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para14"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke about how important it was that overview and scrutiny committees acted with vigour and argued that referrals should be mandatory. I find it hard to believe that the major local authorities&#151;the 150 social services authorities, which are some of the most powerful local authorities in the land&#151;would be inhibited about referring matters to the Secretary of State or elsewhere, if they felt that there was something wrong with healthcare provision or facilities in their area.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para15"></a>The noble Earl made a more substantial point about anxieties that local authorities might, at times, behave in a party political way that might inhibit the vigour of their response. There is no black-and-white answer to that problem. Even if we created a duty to refer, it would not necessarily be meaningful; people can refer things without putting much power into it. The local authorities will have noticed what happened in the case of Kidderminster Hospital and are more alert to the importance of taking seriously the concerns of the local public about health provision and do not think that they can behave along rather crude party lines. I am not necessarily implying that that was what Bromsgrove District Council did in that case.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para16"></a>There has been previous reference to overview and scrutiny committees and how they will develop. The general advice, as I recollect it, was that they should not be whipped. They should give fairly full representation to all political parties, and they will have failed if they fulfil their duties in the kind of party political or partisan way about which the noble Earl was concerned.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para17"></a>The question of whether strategic health authorities would consult about changes in PCT functions was mentioned. There will be no duty of consultation, as such, on the delegation of functions. However, if the shift of functions affects the development of the service and the way in which it is developed, the public will be consulted, under Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. I hope that that gives noble Lords sufficient comfort.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para18"></a>For those reasons&#151;reinforced by what we said today&#151;we believe that there is no need for the amendment. It should not be pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-13_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his response. He repeated many of the arguments deployed last time and said, in particular, that the amendment would give rise to consultation overload. I do not see things in the same light. Consultation is an <P>


<a name="column_473"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>integral part of the quality agenda. It is integral to proper accountability in the system, which, to their credit, the Government say that they want to achieve.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para19"></a>The overall trend in the Bill and in the Health and Social Care Act 2001 is to make the arrangements for consultation a good deal fuzzier. With CHCs, we have a clear, discernible process; what we are being given is more of a focus-group approach. I am not saying that focus groups do not have their merits. They are&#151;or can be&#151;useful devices. However, if legal duties to consult are lost and if the power of local communities to act against poor consultation or bad decisions is lost, the whole process will be reduced from a power to act to a power merely to talk. That is the background to the amendment. It is not superfluous.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para20"></a>The Minister said that paragraph (2) of the amendment was covered by the government amendment agreed to previously that relates to consultation orders for strategic health authorities. However, that paragraph of my amendment includes NHS trusts, PCTs and care trusts, which are, otherwise, missed out. It also provides for consultations on variations and revocations, not simply establishments. I do not share the Minister's view that it merely replicates the measures that have already been put in place.
<P>

<a name="20516-13_para21"></a>In view of the hour, however, I shall not press the matter. The point has been made, and I do not feel that I can say any more. I thank noble Lords who contributed to the debate, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20516-14_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20516-14_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment refers specifically to the clause relating to complaints against regulatory bodies. When the clause was last debated, the Minister pointed out the importance of allowing members of the public to press for an explanation of delays, when they have made a complaint against a healthcare professional. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, warned against a system that automatically allowed every complaint to come to the council if the complainant was dissatisfied.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para2"></a>The complaints procedures laid out here cause me great anxiety. Each regulator must have an appeals system in place and be able to receive complaints against the way in which it has conducted its business. Within its internal complaints procedure, the regulator must have a system for resolving such complaints. If the complaints are major, the body should&#151;must&#151;have a procedure for external review of its procedures. However, the internal complaints procedure should allow a complainant to return if he feels that his complaint has not been adequately heard or processed. There is no dispute that there must be a system that allows people to come back.
<P>


<a name="column_474"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para3"></a>The data on such complaints will be contained in the annual report of the regulatory body. If the procedures are not conducted adequately, it will be evident from the report, as will the fact that the standards set for the complaints procedure are not being adhered to. There is now provision for the council to direct a regulator to alter its code of practice through the affirmative resolution procedure. That has already been debated.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para4"></a>If the complainant is not satisfied that the regulator has listened adequately to the complaint about the processes of that regulator, it would be appropriate for the complainant to go then to the health service ombudsman. I am concerned that, if the complaints procedure is internal to the council, the council will receive an inordinate number of complaints that should be dealt with by the individual regulator. It will undermine the council's ability to be an overarching body that can ensure that there is equity in complaints procedures.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para5"></a>My other concerns relate to the fact that there will be different patterns of healthcare delivery in different parts of the United Kingdom. The regulation of healthcare professionals is a reserved power: so it should be. There may be a situation in which a decision is made about a complaint against a healthcare professional acting in a certain way in one part of the United Kingdom, such as Scotland or Northern Ireland, that could, at face value, set a precedent. It could be that a similar-seeming complaint made in England could be treated in the same way, although, in fact, it should be interpreted differently when the relevant regulatory body consider the minutiae of the issue. Decisions are often similar on the surface but turn out to be fundamentally different. Another problem is that under Clause 27(3) and (4), the council will act as a court&#151;over and above the regulators. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, previously alluded to a difficulty in relation to the delicate issues surrounding confidentiality and disclosure. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness raised some important points, with which I sympathise. Clause 27 is something of a Cinderella. We did not discuss amendments to it in Committee because we came to it at the end of the fourth day in Committee and it was getting very late. Also, it was practically the last clause to be discussed on Report. I am not clear that we have discussed all the important issues that arise from the clause.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para6"></a>Clause 27 gives wide powers to the Secretary of State to establish complaints procedures&#151;many of which can override the provisions of the regulated bodies. I refer in particular to Clause 27(2)(g), which allows the Secretary of State to specify what happens in relation to the important area of confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para7"></a>On Report, the Minister said that the Government's decision was that Parliament should decide on important and sensitive issues. It is not that simple.

<FONT SIZE=3>orders. We have no ability to amend, so are left with the possibility of rejecting the whole order&#151;which is often taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para8"></a>The Secretary of State will be the decision maker, which adds to Clause 27 being unsatisfactory, with worrying implications&#151;particularly in relation to important matters that are properly dealt with by the regulatory bodies but which could be overridden. We do not know how the powers will be used. The Explanatory Notes are silent and the Minister has said nothing&#151;certainly not in your Lordships' House&#151;about the Government's intentions. Will the Minister say how and when the Government intend to use the powers in Clause 27? What consultation will there be before those powers are used&#151;and what role does he expect the professional bodies to play in the development of a further tier to the complaints procedure?

<A NAME="20516-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am not in a position to give a timetable for which such regulations might be brought before Parliament, but of course there would be full consultation. The regulatory bodies themselves will no doubt play an important role in putting forward their own views.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para9"></a>Clause 27 is one of a number of clauses that develop the theme of the careful balance that we have attempted to strike between the benefits of self-regulation, the role of the regulatory bodies and the overriding public interest. The changes made as the Bill has progressed through both Houses have achieved that balance&#151;which is why the regulatory bodies have expressed satisfaction with the outcome of discussions.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para10"></a>Clause 27 is not to be seen as a means of overturning decisions of fitness-to-practice committees but as a power to investigate maladministration. The noble Baroness suggested that the ombudsman should have a role in relation to the regulatory bodies&#151;but they are not subject to any ombudsmen because they are not government bodies. Our debates would suggest that none of us wishes them ever to be seen as government bodies. If an ombudsman cannot be involved, there is a persuasive argument for the council to carry out that function in relation to maladministration.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para11"></a>While I hold the regulatory bodies in the highest regard, one cannot say that all of them have uniformly been particularly efficient in conducting their own disciplinary cases. In the past, some complainants have been the subjected to long waits, have had little idea about the progress of their cases and have received little information about the process as a whole.
<P>

<a name="20516-14_para12"></a>The regulatory bodies themselves recognise those problems and are working hard to put them right&#151; but a backstop is needed, to permit another <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>body to investigate where there is evidence of maladministration. Clause 27 provides that ability. Regulations for its operation would have to be brought before your Lordships' House and be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, which will provide sufficient safeguards.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, would the Secretary of State only trigger the powers in Clause 27 if there was evidence of maladministration among the regulatory bodies?

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for going some way to providing reassurance in respect of the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I am slightly concerned that the Minister has left the matter so open. I am glad that the concept of maladministration will be the underpinning principle by which Clause 27 could be invoked. There is certainly a need for some form of backstop to protect the public. The Minister is correct when he says that delays in processing complaints cause undue tension and distress. While there are still some gaps left, I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance that there will be limits on the way that Clause 27 is used. I beg leave to withdraw to amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It is a short and technical Bill, but it seeks to tackle a fast-growing problem; the theft of mobile phones.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para0"></a>Tackling mobile phone theft is a key to driving down street crime. There is no doubt that the theft of mobile phones is a significant and genuine problem. The Home Office research report, Mobile Phone Theft, published in January 2002 showed that mobile phone theft is fuelling the rise in street robbery. For example, in 2000-01, mobile phones were stolen in 28 per cent of all robberies, compared with 8 per cent three years previously.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para1"></a>In the Metropolitan Police area alone, the percentage of offences where a mobile phone is among the items stolen has risen from 25 per cent in 1999-2000 to 50 per cent in 2001-02. The Home Office has been working with the mobile phone network providers to address the problem of mobile phone theft. We set up a steering group with the police and the industry in January last year to develop an action plan of practical measures.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para2"></a>Significant progress has been made. The Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum, two members of which I met today, agreed earlier this year to share information about stolen handsets. We have encouraged mobile phone operators and retailers to promote security information on their websites and manufacturers to give greater prominence to security advice in their manuals. And we have now issued more than 2 million of the crime prevention leaflets advising on measures to take to avoid mobile phone theft.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para3"></a>I now turn to the specific issue that is addressed by the Bill. We announced in February that by the end of the summer all of the five main network providers will have in place the technology to disable a phone across all networks once it has been reported as stolen.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para4"></a>Mobile phones can be disabled through a serial number on each handset, known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity number&#151;the IMEI number. That is a 15-digit number which is programmed into the handset and is also visible on the body of the handset. The number appears on the records of network providers each time the phone is used. Phones reported as stolen will be barred from further use by reference to that number.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para5"></a>Barring the handsets in that way should act as a strong deterrent to the thieves, preventing them from being able to use the phones that they steal. And if they cannot be used, they cannot be sold on&#151;there is no market.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para6"></a>However, barring a handset is not effective if the IMEI number is changed. Changing the number makes it impossible for the operators to track and disable it. At present, it is relatively cheap and easy to change the IMEI number of a mobile phone by using software to reprogramme the handset. Such software <P>


<a name="column_478"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is freely available. Indeed, it may be bought or downloaded from the Internet. The police, for example, have seen a promotional leaflet offering for sale a kit which will change an IMEI number in five seconds. The kit costs &#163;145. If the number is changed, a stolen phone reprogrammed in that way can then be sold on the black market.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para7"></a>Existing international security standards state that the IMEI number should not be changed and that it should be resistant to change. We are encouraging the manufacturers to do more to achieve this, but the present position is that numbers can be changed.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para8"></a>Perhaps I may give a further example to indicate the extent of the problem. BT Cellnet, which is now 0-2, estimated in July 2001 that there were potentially 1.5 million phones on that particular network whose IMEI number had been changed from their manufactured number. The Metropolitan Police and the mobile phone industry found that of a sample of 300 stolen phones only 10 per cent were being re-used with their original IMEI numbers. They concluded that the remaining 90 per cent were either disposed of or, as seems more likely, being reprogrammed. Furthermore&#151;and this is the nub of the reason for the Bill&#151;it is not currently illegal to reprogramme a phone in this way. That is the situation which this narrow and technical Bill seeks to address.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para9"></a>In February, the Government indicated their intention to outlaw the activity at the earliest opportunity as part of the wider package of measures and actions we are developing to help tackle the problem of mobile phone robbery. In the meantime, we are continuing to press manufacturers to stop the problem at source by making it more difficult to change the identity of a handset.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para10"></a>Perhaps I may give the House a further example. Apparently, the most duplicated IMEI number on the BT Cellnet records had been copied no fewer than 9,495 times at the time the information was provided to me. Two days later when it was checked again, a further 18 versions of that number were on the system. There is therefore no question that there is a big industry out there.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para11"></a>I turn to what the Bill will do. It will create a new criminal offence of unauthorised reprogramming of mobile phone handsets. Specifically, it will be an offence to change or interfere with the operation of a phone's unique identifier; that is, the IMEI number. It will also create linked offences of possessing, supplying or offering to supply equipment for that purpose. It will be an offence to be in possession of equipment with the intention of unauthorised reprogramming.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para12"></a>There will be occasions when the manufacturers of a mobile phone will need to change the IMEI number. No offence will be committed if the change is made by manufacturers or with their written consent.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para13"></a>The new either-way offences of changing or interfering with the equipment identifier of the mobile phones without authorisation and possessing or supplying the equipment for that purpose will carry a maximum penalty on indictment of five years' <P>


<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imprisonment, or an unlimited fine, or both. In the magistrates' court, an offender may be punished with six months' imprisonment or a fine of up to &#163;5,000 or both. The offence will be an arrestable offence under the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para14"></a>I accept that the penalties, in particular for what appears to be a non-violent offence, look severe and we make no bones about that. The courts are cracking down on street robbers and those who fuel their activity, and they must expect to be dealt with harshly. Street crime is a problem and we are determined to deal with it.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para15"></a>The creation of the new offences will close the existing loophole and send out a strong signal that Parliament is not prepared to tolerate the activities of those who seek to derive financial benefit from preying on their fellow citizens and abusing the lawful and profitable trade of mobile phones in this way. The mobile phone industry, the police and, I understand, all political parties are behind the initiative.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para16"></a>I fully accept&#151;although I make no promises&#151;that there may not be a large number of prosecutions for the new offences. The legislation will help the police target and catch those involved in the reprogramming of mobile phones. With a telephone number being copied so many times, as in the example I gave, there is obviously an industry out there&#151;one might say a cottage industry but a very big one. We do not believe that any legitimate business will be affected by the Bill. We have established with the industry that there is no legitimate reason for any individual to be involved in reprogramming a mobile phone.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para17"></a>We are determined to do everything we can to stop the theft of mobile phones, which is doing much to fuel robbery and the general fear of crime on our streets. The Bill will close a gap in the law. It does not deal with everything but it is highly targeted. I fully admit that in introducing a Bill beyond the middle of May and hoping that it will become law before the Summer Recess we must be very modest in our intentions; otherwise, Parliament rightly would not stand for it. We have a serious problem on our hands and this is a narrow Bill to deal with a narrow issue&#151;I accept that it does not deal with all the issues relating to the mobile phone industry. In any event, the Bill is not being introduced in isolation because many other issues relating to street crime are being taken forward in a number of other wider initiatives.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para18"></a>I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for offering that explanation of why the Bill is necessary. He was right to point out some of the Home Office research into this matter.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para20"></a>No one can be in doubt that we need legislation to curb such criminal activities. However, we need to distinguish between those who steal phones because <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are somebody's possession and they do not have one, as against the organised criminals who find that mobile phones are easy to dispose of because there is a market here and abroad and such equipment can easily be converted into currency.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para21"></a>There is an ugly side to such criminal activities which no civilised society can tolerate. In January, we saw headlines in our paper about a mobile phone thief who was jailed for four years with a dire warning that such a sentence would act as a deterrent.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para22"></a>The judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, goes beyond the theft of mobile phones. It is about mugging, violent attacks and the bullying of victims. Of course it is questionable whether prison sentences for young people are effective in preventing such crime. We know that imprisonment does little to provide a deterrent. However, we cannot ignore the fact that according to the British Crime Survey about 470,000 mobile phones were stolen in incidents involving householders in 2000. The figure is an underestimation since the research does not cover commercial targets or incidents involving those under 16.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para23"></a>This must be a worrying trend. It causes a large blip in our crime figures. The fear of crime must never be underestimated. We must add to that factor violence against victims. We know little as to how much of the activity is geared towards converting phone thefts into currency to satisfy a drug culture.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para24"></a>It is for all those reasons that we need legislation to ensure public safety, reduction of this high level of crime and punishment for those who perpetrate such crime. The Bill, therefore, has our broad support.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para25"></a>There are, of course, areas of concern. Children aged between 11 and 15 years account for over half the annual 1 million victims estimated by the police. The Bill does little to address that issue because we are dealing only with legislation which creates a number of offences relating to the electronic identifiers of mobile wireless communication devices and those young people of 11 to 15 years will hardly feature in that category.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para26"></a>It would be impossible to identify how many young people between 11 and 15 years are involved in the process that leads to re-programming of the equipment. I suspect that, like most street crimes, it is more for personal benefit rather than through organised criminal activity that phones are stolen from and by that age group. It would be wrong, therefore, to build up expectations that the legislation would have any effect in that regard but that does not mean that it is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para27"></a>We are dealing with the two ugly sides of phone thefts. In the youth offending pattern we need to ensure that there are adequate sentencing guidelines which will deal with the matter in the context of street crimes taking into account the aggravating factor if violence is involved.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para28"></a>Equally, the mobile telephone industry needs to develop a role of public education. I met with the representatives of the Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum and was impressed with the action it is taking. <P>


<a name="column_481"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It has created an industry group to address the problems. I understand that there is an agreed equipment identity register. It has undertaken member activity to bring increased awareness of safety issues. It also has a close liaison with the Government and the police on measures to combat this type of crime.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para29"></a>The forum supports the Government's Bill. It will curb the activities of individuals and organised gangs on reprogramming stolen devices, which criminals do with impunity. But there should be a warning for the mobile phone industry as well. In the present days of technological advancement it must invest enough resources to ensure that technology is available to demobilise any stolen property. That cannot be beyond the means of science today. It would be nice to hear what the industry is doing about it.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para30"></a>I do not believe that we should delay this legislation unnecessarily. However, it would be helpful to know the following. Is there any legislation in European Union countries on similar lines to ensure that overseas bases are not used for reprogramming? I take it that we have no jurisdiction over what happens in other European Union countries. Is there any estimate of how widespread the activity of reprogramming is? The Minister was good enough to give some examples. Is this activity limited to some big crooks; or do we take it that almost anyone with know-how can manage to manipulate mobile phones? What consultations are taking place with the mobile phone industry to ensure that there is a programme of public education about the seriousness of using phones which have been tampered with?
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para31"></a>Will the Minister explain the rationale underlying the five years' imprisonment? How was that period arrived at? The penalty is severe but I suspect that the maximum would apply only in exceptional cases where widespread recycling of stolen sets was involved. In that case I have no doubt that the custodial option may be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para32"></a>We support the Bill. At present no offence directly covers tampering with the unique identification device on a mobile phone. I suspect that there would be a handling offence under Section 22(1) of the Theft Act&#151;for example, dishonest assistance in the retention, removal, disposal or realisation of stolen goods knowing or believing the same to be stolen. I wish the Bill a speedy passage so that we are able to ensure that the level of this crime diminishes in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to add my voice in support of the Bill. We shall do what we can to speed through the procedures in this House and send the Bill winging on its way to another place as soon as reasonably possible.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para33"></a>It is a highly technical subject but it is intimately involved with a deep social problem at present: the disastrous increase in street crime. Whether that involves the young stealing for status, the slightly older young stealing to fund a drug habit, or organised crime is neither here nor there. It is a dreadful fact that the <P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advent of the mobile phone, which has been such a blessing in so many ways to so many people, has also become a curse.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para34"></a>The Bill is particularly welcome because it is a keystone in a tide of action over the summer by the industry&#151;manufacturers and service providers&#151;to try to make these wonderful gadgets useless as soon as possible after they are stolen. That is what it is all about. The manufacturers and the service providers have done a remarkably good job. We have heard about the organisation that they have established. I am grateful for the briefing I have received from that body and others. It has helped me to understand the issues.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para35"></a>As the Minister said, the remaining key problem&#151;this little Bill is a keystone in the arch&#151;is that it is possible to reprogramme a mobile phone's unique identification number and the service providers cannot crack that problem.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para36"></a>It is a simple Bill. One could almost say that one has no problems with it. Clause 1 makes the reprogramming of mobile telephones an offence and provides a severe penalty, which I believe is justified. If such reprogramming is an unofficial criminal industry it needs to be stopped. Therefore, the penalties should be severe. Like the Minister, I hope that the number of prosecutions under the legislation will be small. It would be gratifying to find that not everyone was "doing it", as is said. But if people are going to get involved in the activity, they should be aware that the penalties are severe, and rightly so. Like the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I have some doubts about the five year penal penalty because the prisons are already overcrowded. It seems to me that heavy financial penalties may well be more appropriate, particularly if the activity is a commercial enterprise.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para37"></a>We have difficulties with the wording rather than the principle of Clause 2. In order to modify a mobile phone's unique identification number, the object in the clause which one has to have under one's control is a computer. But we all of us have computers. I quote from the Bill:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person commits an offence if he has in his custody . . . anything which may be used for the purpose of changing or interfering with the operation of a unique device identifier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-15_para38"></a>
The Bill continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and he intends to use the thing unlawfully for that purpose".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-15_para39"></a><P>

<a name="20516-15_para40"></a>The other part of the "thing" that is necessary in order to undertake this criminal activity is a particular type of program on the computer. I do not believe that it is a specific type of program. Regrettably, that can be downloaded from the Internet so that when, under Clause 2(2),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person commits an offence if he supplies anything which may be used for the purpose of changing or interfering with the operation of a unique device identifier"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-15_para41"></a>
or he offers to supply, that could apply to both the computer and the program. But, as we have heard, the computer can be sold perfectly innocently and properly. It is used almost universally throughout the country. The program is available. Although we can make it an offence in this country to supply, if it is available on the Internet then it will be available. It seems to me that we have a little difficulty here.
<P>


<a name="column_483"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para42"></a>It comes back to the addition in the Bill of the words "intent" and "belief". I do not know how it is possible to find someone guilty of selling something to a person who intends to use it in an improper way. The purchaser is most unlikely to have confessed to the vendor that that was the intent. For the life of me, I do not see how the vendor could judge such an intent. I think of PC World and Dell which sell computers by the dozen every week. Even though they may make it very plain that the improper use of a computer is an offence, it would be impossible to prevent them selling the computers. Equally, it would be impossible to restrict the availability of the program. As the Explanatory Notes to the Bill state, there are perfectly proper uses for the programs which have nothing to do with criminal activity.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para43"></a>We shall have to look at Clause 2 of the Bill with a view to trying to tighten up the wording. At the moment I do not believe that it would be effective. Clause 1 is fine and the offence is quite clear. If someone is caught in the act of altering a mobile phone's unique identification number, there is no problem. But if one tries to restrict the availability of equipment we should try to tighten up what is on the face of the Bill in order to make it better before we send it to another place. I do not believe that that will be a great task. I am sure that if we put our heads together before Committee stage we should be able to work out something fairly quickly.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para44"></a>As I said, this is an important and welcome Bill. In a sense it is a keystone in the arch of measures setting out to reduce what has turned a blessing to society, as I said earlier in my remarks, into a curse for too many people. Therefore, it is a wholly welcome piece of legislation. I shall be very glad to do all I can both to improve it and to get it through the processes as quickly as possible.

<A NAME="20516-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the tone and the content of the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Dixon-Smith, on this Bill. Quite clearly, there will be a Committee stage when we shall deal with some of the issues which have been raised.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para45"></a>Perhaps initially I may deal broadly with some of the points which have been raised. We are not aware of any legislation overseas, but the officials I met this morning from the Department of Trade and Industry stated that they have a plan of action to discuss these matters with overseas governments. Other than our European partners, the key government is the United States of America. If we can get them on board we could be very effective.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para46"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, raised a point about severity of sentences. There is a problem with that. In the Bill it is an either-way offence and therefore a distinction can be drawn between individual theft and the activity of organised criminals. It is the latter who receive the tougher sentences or the unlimited fines. It may be that that is the way to hit such people.

They are confident that they will be able to mount successful investigations and prosecutions. I can say more about that at Committee stage. The police are fully behind the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para48"></a>The Bill covers only one aspect of the matter. From August the mobile service providers will be able to make the IMEI number ineffective on all lost or stolen phones. From September it is anticipated that there will be a database shared by the service providers and accessible to the police, which will contain details of all stolen mobile phones. In a way those are extras, but they will provide good armoury. It is hoped that the way the Bill is drafted will take account of the changes in technology. I am not au fait with the technology, but I understand that the new technology is called "blue tooth" technology. I have never heard of the phrase before. I have had it explained to me. It is quite incredible as regards mobile phones. Quite clearly, the future is blue rather than orange but not of a political hue. I am grateful for the remarks of noble Lords and I commend the Bill to the House.
<P>

<a name="20516-15_para49"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.

<A NAME="20516-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hooper </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what part they intend to play in the Euro-Latin American summit planned by the Spanish presidency of the European Union, particularly in view of recent developments in Argentina and Mercosur.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, when I originally tabled this Unstarred Question, the date of the European Union-Latin American Summit was not known. It now transpires that it will take place in Madrid tomorrow. This debate is, therefore, most timely, if a little at the ultimo momento. My apologies go to those approaching the Box who may have been adversely affected as a result.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para1"></a>Perhaps I may also add that this morning I was honoured by being appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for services to UK-Latin America relations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-16_spnew1"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hooper: </B>   My Lords, this, too, was entirely coincidental, but I feel that this debate is a fitting way to celebrate.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para2"></a>Perhaps I may begin by congratulating the Spanish presidency on its initiative in calling this EU-Latin American Summit. Again, in the light of recent dramatic events in Venezuela as well as those in Argentina, this is a good opportunity to ensure that Latin American countries are aware of European <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest and opportunities for trade and investment so that they do not feel that they are solely dependent on the United States.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para3"></a>I hope that the Summit will not be a "one-off" and that a regular EU-Latin American dialogue will continue to take place in future years. I urge and ask the Government to make it clear that the United Kingdom supports such a dialogue and has a useful and important, not to say key role to play in promoting further and better links with Latin America.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para4"></a>Over the past five years Canning House, the Hispanic and Luso Brazilian Council of which I have the honour to be president, has arranged European Union-themed conferences in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile, which have tied in with the bilateral negotiations for free trade agreements between the EU and Mexico, the EU and Chile and between the EU and the Mercosur countries, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para5"></a>The only such agreement to come into effect so far is the Mexican agreement. The Mexican Minister for the economy, who was in London last week, told me that Mexico's trade with the EU has already increased by 20 per cent as a result. That must be good news. I therefore ask the Government to play a role in ensuring that the negotiations with Chile are concluded as rapidly as possible and that the more complex negotiations with Mercosur are pursued vigorously.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para6"></a>As I understand it, the stumbling block, as ever, in the negotiations is that of the common agricultural policy and its system of subsidies, given that primary agricultural products form a significant element of the economies of all four Mercosur countries.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para7"></a>We all know that further reform of the CAP is&#151;and has been for a long time&#151;high on the UK agenda. Therefore, in this, our interests coincide. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us as to the progress of these important negotiations.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para8"></a>In discussing the EU/Mercosur relationship, it may be of value to examine Mercosur and its members in a little more detail. As a regional organisation, Mercosur&#151;which literally means the southern market&#151;looked to our experience in the Common Market, now the European Union, and started in 1991 (some 11 years ago) with four members&#151;two large and two small: Brazil and Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has since concluded a special association agreement with Chile, and similar arrangements are under discussion with Mexico and Venezuela.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para9"></a>Intra-regional trade increased enormously and tariff barriers have been systematically reduced. Even in the political field there has been benefit. A few years ago, when the incident took place in Paraguay and it looked as though the military were taking over, under the pressure of the other Mercosur partners the country succeeded in maintaining a democratic process. That, too, must be very good news.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para10"></a>Mercosur has helped its member countries to weather the previous world and regional recessions, and two years ago its member countries could be said <P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have fulfilled the Maastricht criteria rather better than some European countries. It is true that when Brazil devalued the real by 28 per cent some three years ago, Argentina was adversely affected because of its increased volume of exports to Brazil: its hands were tied because the peso was tied to the dollar. That was not the sole cause of Argentina's present troubles, but it was undoubtedly a factor. But on the whole, Mercosur has proceeded at a cracking pace. I hope that the present troubles, caused largely by the situation in Argentina, will not prevent it from continuing.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para11"></a>The current troubles in Argentina have been a shock to us all. From the UK point of view, we have many special links with Argentina. There was the historic support for the independence movement provided by George Canning to San Marti, and the liberation of the Southern Cone countries at the beginning of the 19th century. There is a long-standing British-Argentine community; there are English-speaking schools; and the English Speaking Union and other such organisations are based there. I have led trade missions there, as have other noble Lords, to promote and consolidate this special relationship and to increase our trade. I very much hope that current British investments, particularly in the energy field&#151;British Gas has an important stake there&#151;as well as in banking and in traditional companies such as ICI, will continue to hang on in there.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para12"></a>Victor Borges, the famous Argentine thinker and writer, once said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To understand Argentina you have to understand Europe&#151;Argentina is a country of European exiles".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-16_para13"></a>
Europe must stand by Argentina as it goes through its present agonising period of reconstruction and reorganisation, and we must be constructive in our suggestions.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para14"></a>We must remember that, for example, an individual living in Buenos Aires enjoyed a lifestyle very similar to ours. There is a strong middle class in Argentina. They, as well as the increasing numbers of people below the poverty line&#151;with real levels of unemployment at 30 per cent in some places&#151;are having a very bad time. I do not think it is too dramatic to say that it could happen to us. Life in Argentina was very good. It is very sad to think what is happening now.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para15"></a>We are all looking to the IMF to provide a solution. Perhaps the IMF should have done something three years ago, when Brazil devalued its currency. Perhaps the provisions of Chapter 11 should have come into play at that stage. My suggestion, therefore, is that the Government should press our European partners not only to stand by Argentina in this crisis but to look more generally at the way in which the IMF operates and reacts, so that preventive action can be encouraged before it is too late.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para16"></a>Because of the time factor, I have dwelt on the countries which are the particular focus of my Question. However, there are many issues affecting Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and the Central American countries which will doubtless arise <P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at the summit&#151;such as the prevention and containment of the narcotics trade, as regards which Britain, as a consumer country, is working with many of the producer countries. There are the law and order issues, where again we can co-operate and exchange ideas for best practice. There are endless cultural opportunities. The British Council plays a very positive role in that respect, as does Canning House. We look forward in particular to the Aztec exhibition which is due to take place at the Royal Academy in November this year, and which we hope will be opened by President Fox of Mexico. It will be the largest collection of Aztec art and artefacts ever to be put on show.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para17"></a>Given my admitted partiality for the region, perhaps I may be permitted to summarise by saying: the good news is that the democratic processes remain in place in all these countries. Inflation remains under control. Looking at the broad picture, it is interesting to note that foreign direct investment continues to flow into the region and portfolio investors, encouraged by greater global liquidity, are recognising the good value that can be found in companies in Latin America. The collapse of Enron has perhaps shown that even major groups in the developed world are not without risk; and in terms of emerging markets, Latin America is a star. I feel sure that the Government, and particularly the Minister with responsibility for Latin America, Denis MacShane, will make this known and will improve on the position.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para18"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may thank all those who will contribute to the debate and say how much I look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope that we may receive some feedback from the summit meeting in due course.

<A NAME="20516-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that I speak on behalf of the whole House&#151;those present and those absent&#151;in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, on the honour accorded her today. It is a signal recognition of all that she has done over so many years to promote relationships between our country and South America. It is also a recognition of the depth of the relationships that have extended over centuries between our two regions.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para19"></a>This is an important debate. Of all the nations outside the British Commonwealth (England and its ex-colonies) the one European nation which has the greatest connection with the developing world is Spain. It is a happy coincidence that the Spanish presidency should coincide with the Latin American summit this weekend. It is a happy coincidence not only culturally but economically.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para20"></a>The two topics that I wish to raise for consideration are, first, business and, secondly, people. In regard to business, it should be noted by the rest of South America that the two countries, Mexico and Chile, with which the European Union has reached economic accords, have achieved that result by free market <P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development, economic and political stability and a firm intention to develop their countries' economies towards Europe as well as north towards America.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para21"></a>Mexico and Europe have over &#163;1 billion of trade a year. Some 23 per cent of Mexico's foreign investors are European companies. It is a country which can look forward to a confident future with the help of Europe, as can Chile.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para22"></a>That example should be followed by the inter-regional contact established between the European Union and Mercosur. From the many meetings that have taken place, there now appears to be a finality to the future arrangements in terms of political dialogue, economic co-operation and the promotion of common business interests.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para23"></a>There are two aspects that I would emphasise. If it works, the Mercosur example should be followed by the Andean countries and it should act as an encouragement to Mexico and the Central American countries which are themselves considering a common market arrangement in that part of the world.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para24"></a>The one sector in which this country should play its part in developing its European contacts with South America is the energy sector. Petrol and gas exploration, which is central to our national economy domestically and abroad, is a major element of future investment and development in South America. Britain should play its part nationally and through Europe.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para25"></a>All in all, Europe works well with South America, a relationship promoted in particular by this country and Spain. Business works only if those participating in it share common values and common trust. I shall refer to two countries whose people need co-operation from our end in a very important way. The first is Colombia. That blighted country has 1.5 million displaced people, of whom more than 1 million are children. Those internal refugees are living in dire circumstances. Europe has a major programme, of which we should be proud. We should ask yet more of it to help that country.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para26"></a>I turn finally to Argentina. It beggars belief that the fourth or fifth richest country in the world at the end of the Second World War should be in its present disastrous condition. How could it happen? There are many theories and many beliefs. But it is solutions we should be looking for, not explanations. Nearly half the population of an educated and civilised country are living in poverty or near poverty. The middle class is on its knees. It is a country whose people have no confidence whatever in either politicians or public institutions.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para27"></a>That terrible state of affairs demands our help. It is difficult to know precisely how such help can be given, but Europe is an obvious source of rescue for a country whose people deserve it whatever we think of its politicians who have produced the present situation.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para28"></a>Those are two examples of countries in a continent experiencing much difficulty but where great hope still exists. It is a hope that Europe should nurture, both in business and with regard to people. How far we in Europe have come with those in the Americas! Many <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>years ago my Spanish wife asked an Irish relative of mine the word in Irish for ma&#241;ana to which he replied that there was no word that embraced such a sense of urgency.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para29"></a>The Government's timing is most efficient. Our debate is taking place on the day before the international conference. I hope that our comments will be heard and that my noble friend the Minister will tell us in due course that the United Kingdom will play a full part in European Union efforts to improve business and the progress of the people in South America.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, in offering my sincere congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, on her honour, which is very much deserved. She and one or two others have kept the flag of Latin America flying in the House and she thoroughly deserves the acknowledgement that she has now achieved for all her work here and in Latin America.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para30"></a>I also welcome the role of the Spanish presidency and the Euro-Latin American Summit. In the early days of the European Community the United Kingdom was regarded as particularly well placed to keep open the channel of communication between Europe and the United States&#151;Norte America in Latin American parlance.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para31"></a>Now Spain can demonstrate its special role vis-&#224;-vis Latin America, which is a sub-continent that some people in this country and in this place feel has been somewhat neglected by us in modern times. I remember being in Cuba, where Spanish colonial rule is a good deal more recent than in other parts of Latin America, and admiring the way in which the Spaniards could swim through those dangerous currents and conduct good commercial relationships with that difficult country.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para32"></a>This initiative can be seen in different ways, both in Latin America and the European Union, as a recognition of the substantial social and economic strength of the region. It is an indication that the EU and its members could provide another powerful partner to balance the United States, or as the culmination of a number of trade negotiations that have been running for some time, either bilaterally, as with Chile, or with Mercosur, the negotiations of which have been described in great detail.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para33"></a>I remind the House that during his visit to Brazil in August last year the Prime Minister said that the EU should overcome its old practices of farm subsidies and trade barriers which disrupted the economy and hurt developing countries. Do the Government now feel that a treaty with Mercosur is still available, if not immediately, then in the fairly short term, especially as a similar sort of arrangement appears to be on the verge of being successfully concluded with Chile?
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para34"></a>A major source of concern for all participants in the summit must be the current parlous condition of Argentina financially, economically and politically. Banks have closed or been suspended; the currency has <P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plunged against the dollar and is not in use as a means of exchange in some parts of the country. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, reminded us that Argentina was one of the most powerful and richest countries in the world not that long ago. Output is expected to decline by 10 to 15 per cent this year. The numbers of unemployed and the poor grow and the political processes seem incapable of resolving such situations. One must ask what others can do. I want to follow the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, in asking whether the UK Government think that any action on behalf of the EU could assist Argentina in its current plight and what such action might be. Are proposals of support expected to come out of this summit? If so, what conditions might be required of Argentina in terms of better governance?
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para35"></a>Argentina is not the only country in Latin America which faces difficulties. In Colombia a drug-fuelled war still rages. The Government of Venezuela have recently been badly shaken, although they may yet re-establish themselves. Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay and Bolivia are still very poor, although they are no longer among the poorest nations in the world.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para36"></a>Vincente Fox, the first non-PRI president of Mexico for 70 years, is not finding it easy to bring in the tax, constitutional and economic reforms with which he wanted to modernise and transform his country.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para37"></a>Cuba still manages to defy the US embargo, which is now 40 years old, and still, by its very existence, causes ripples of unease as neighbours pick their way between Castro and Uncle Sam. In fact, it would be interesting to know whether Fidel Castro has been invited to this conference; and, if so, whether he will attend. He is one of the least travelled and longest serving heads of state in the world today.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para38"></a>However, one should not allow doom and gloom to dominate one's view of Latin America. As has already been said, its people have a strong dose of what one might call "Europeanism". They are well educated in comparative terms. When I lived in Peru 30 years ago, I remember being convinced&#151;with some reason&#151;that there would be more illiterate people in Peru and in all of Latin America, both as a percentage of the population and in absolute terms, by the end of the century than was the case at that time. I have been proved completely, and thankfully, wrong. Widespread education provision is available to a large percentage of the population in all the Latin American countries.
<P>

<a name="20516-16_para39"></a>People in Latin America have also achieved much in other ways; for example, access to clean water, which is always a guide to health, is widely available. Indeed, the majority of the population in most of its countries now have access to clean water. Moreover, the use of contraceptives has increased enormously and infant mortality has significantly reduced in the recent past. These countries have a great deal to offer to the world, even if they sometimes seem curiously unable to preserve a stable government for any useful length of time. There must be something that we can do to assist them&#151;we, who represent some of the most powerful, rich and reasonably well-governed countries&#151;to play <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20516-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, the House is indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, for instigating this debate. I am pleased to intervene briefly in my capacity as secretary of the British-Argentine Parliamentary Group. The noble Baroness is our distinguished vice-chairman. I am delighted to join other speakers in congratulating her on her honour. Her work in the region has been outstanding over many years. It is very gratifying to see her recognised in this way.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para0"></a>As my noble friend Lord Brennan said, the economic and social difficulties facing Argentina are immense, and, for us, their scale is difficult to comprehend. They have had nearly four years of recession, a reduction of 4 per cent in its GDP in 2001, an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent, and one-third of the population is now living in poverty. That is the background against which the government of President Duhalde took office.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para1"></a>Many of us who are happy to be regarded as friends of Argentina and its people looked on in disbelief at the television coverage over Christmas of civil disorder, looting of shops, and other displays of public fury at the consequences of economic collapse, especially those affecting the value of savings deposited in the banks. It must have crossed many people's minds&#151;it certainly crossed mine&#151;that a return to military dictatorship might not have been very far away. But, thankfully, that has not happened, and the democratic system remains in place.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para2"></a>The institutions of the country, law and order, and democracy have survived, despite awful recent events. Elections are planned for September of next year, and we must hope that they take place. The only form of destabilisation that we hope has applied in Argentina relates to the national football team, certainly as far as concerns the forthcoming match on 7th June. However, we should all hope that the adoption of a flexible exchange rate system, the devaluation of the peso, and the other measures that have been put in place, succeed in helping Argentine products regain their competitive edge in international markets, and provide an economic recovery largely led by exports. In this fragile situation, the last thing that Argentina needs is any resurgence of protectionism on the part of <P>


<a name="column_492"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>its principal trading partners; namely, the United States and the European Union. I shall return later to the issue of protectionism.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para3"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, said, Mercosur is an enormously important and potentially attractive economic block. It has a population of 209 million inhabitants, with a combined GDP of 1.071 billion dollars. It is the most important integrated market after NAFTA, the European Union, and Japan.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para4"></a>The performance of Mercosur in promoting regional trade and integration has already been impressive. Between 1990 and 2000 trade within the group grew by 328 per cent, from 4.1 billion dollars to 17.7 billion dollars. Outside the group, Mercosur trade with the rest of the world increased by 178 per cent during the same 10-year span. In particular, European Union exports to Mercosur rose by 254 per cent in that period.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para5"></a>The bloc has also succeeded in attracting foreign direct investment to its member countries with one of the best performances among emerging markets after China. Argentina alone received 98.7 billion dollars of total foreign investment between 1994-2001, and European Union countries were the leading investors with an inflow of 53.1 billion dollars&#151;which accounts for 54 per cent of the total.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para6"></a>Trade and economic bilateral relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom have also benefited from the development of Mercosur. British companies that invested in Argentina have been able to use that as a base from which to expand business in the wider regional market. If the Argentine economy stabilises itself, as we all hope it will, Mercosur will be a very attractive market for encouraging trade and investment opportunities with European Union countries generally. When he replies, I hope that my noble friend the Minister will be able to say that the Government will do their best to promote this within the Community, especially at the forthcoming conferences.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para7"></a>Mercosur is playing an important part in helping to set up the Free Trade Area of the Americas (the FTAA), following the summit held in December 1994 in Miami attended by heads of state and governments of the 34 democracies in the region. The aim is to complete negotiations for the single market by January 2005, and eliminate barriers to trade and investment. The FTAA could create a market of 780 million inhabitants, 10 trillion dollars of GDP&#151;that is, one-third of the world's GDP&#151;and more than 20 per cent of world trade.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para8"></a>Mercosur is also engaged in negotiations with the European Union, with the aim of achieving gradual and reciprocal trade liberalisation. This follows a framework treaty signed in Madrid in 1995. The ultimate aim is to establish a free trade area with the European Union. In the sixth round of negotiations held in Brussels last year, Mercosur presented a proposal asking the EU to adopt a number of measures to eliminate trade barriers that affected bilateral trade, such as agricultural export subsidies. <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Indeed, the noble Baroness referred to the common agricultural policy and the block that that is imposing at present on this sort of important development.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para9"></a>The second European Union-Mercosur summit in Madrid offers a great opportunity to give a new impetus to the bilateral trade and economic negotiations process, so that it will then be possible to move on to the next stage of the negotiations. It is very much in Europe's interest to speed up the process, because a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego could give the United States a huge competitive advantage in the region, if that was at the same time accompanied by trade liberalisation between Mercosur and the European Union. I hope that my noble friend will agree with that and confirm that the Government see themselves as having a role to play in providing a bridge between the EU and Latin and South America.

<A NAME="20516-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, it will come as no surprise to your Lordships' House that I believe that Her Majesty's Government should play a major part in the Euro-Latin American Summit. Our deep-rooted and longstanding historical ties of friendship and trade provide us with a solid foundation for our relationship with Latin America. In the 19th century, British engineers in Latin America built ports and railways, and British entrepreneurs provided capital to finance foreign trade and to launch the oil industry. In more recent years, the work of the British Council and the BBC World Service, as well as trade organisations such as the Latin American Trade Advisory Group, the UK/Brazil Joint Business Council and the UK/Colombia Trade Facilitation Group&#151;in addition to Europe's generalised system of preferences and a series of EU horizontal programmes, as well as the EU co-operation strategy&#151;have brought us much respect in the region and have succeeded both in bringing our business communities together and in establishing, cultural, social, economic and political contacts.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para10"></a>In an interdependent world, all countries face common challenges: how to compete and prosper in a world economy; how to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction; how to prevent terrorism and stop the production, trafficking and consumption of drugs; how to reconcile economic growth with the sustainable use of shared natural resources; how to protect our environment; and, critically, how to strengthen at home and abroad the rule of law and democracy upon which foundations are built for future security, stability and prosperity.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para11"></a>The countries of Latin America, and Mercosur in particular, are natural partners in seeking to address these challenges. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to outline the Government's policy goals and the means by which these goals will be achieved with this in mind. These policy goals should include not only trade and economic issues but also the promotion of democratic institutions and respect for human rights; the improvement of judicial systems to ensure they deliver transparent, equitable justice; the fight against drugs and transnational crime; the <P>


<a name="column_494"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>importance of sustainable development and the encouragement of sound environmental practices; and the substantial reduction of poverty through growth and job creation, as well as assistance in the creation of better health and education systems.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para12"></a>For the sake of brevity, I shall concentrate my remarks on a number of key themes which I believe to be a priority in Europe's relationship with Latin America today. Economic liberalisation and free trade are two of the pillars upon which the architecture of a market economy are built. Britain has long been one of the foremost advocates of efforts to liberalise world trade and pursue transatlantic and global free trade. As long as trading blocs are inclusive and not exclusive and as long as the development of trading relations within blocs is not at the expense of economic relations with the outside world, regional integration is to be welcomed. NAFTA, Mercosur, the Andean Pact, the Group of Three, the Central American Common Market and a host of European multilateral and bilateral free-trade agreements are all evidence of the vigour with which Latin American economies have embraced the principles of liberalisation and open markets.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para13"></a>Indeed, Mercosur, the common market of the southern cone, is now the fourth largest trading bloc in the world, identified by the Export Forum as one of the key target areas for the United Kingdom. Like the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, I hope that the Minister is equally confident that the aim of a free trade area of the Americas will contribute to greater growth in the region and wider opportunities for trade.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para14"></a>One key matter of importance to those attending the Euro-Latin American Summit is democratic development. I hear what my noble friend Lady Hooper has said&#151;I also congratulate her most warmly on her honour&#151;but neither democracy nor prosperity can endure unless they are broadly based. The policies of free markets and open investments which are the key to sustained growth will not be fully unlocked while people feel shut out or left behind. Fairness before the law is not an option for some while institutional weaknesses remain. As in some parts of Asia, a booming economy can be hijacked by corruption and lack of transparency and accountability.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to say what initiatives the Government propose to take with our European colleagues to encourage the development of democratic institutions, legal systems, reliable civil services and higher levels of citizen participation, so that the region's economic success is firmly underpinned by a higher level of democratic development, a robust civil society and a broad-based middle class.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para16"></a>I should like in conclusion to say a few words about drugs. The global drug industry is particularly associated with the cartels of Latin America. I applaud the steps the countries of the region have taken to cut coca production, criminalise money laundering and permit extradition. However, the evil of drug abuse knows no borders. It is incumbent upon us to continue <P>


<a name="column_495"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to provide counter-narcotics assistance to Latin American countries both bilaterally and through international organisations such as the European Union in order to reduce the tragedies caused by the abuse of drugs both in the United Kingdom and the region.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para17"></a>Colombia is a country in the front line of the fight against drugs and the war against drugs traffickers. Some 80 per cent of the world's cocaine supply is produced in Colombia or transits that country. It therefore must be a top priority to tackle the problem at source in Colombia, for what happens to the drugs trade in Colombia affects every government involved in the battle to stamp out drugs. I echo the reflections of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, on this subject.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para18"></a>As I have said before in this House, Europe and Latin America have a joint interest in political stability, the promotion of democracy, the security of our investments and in further developing a thriving and growing trade partnership. I say to the Minister that Latin America, and in particular Argentina at this time, offers a compelling case for closer, active British and European engagement. I look forward to his response.

<A NAME="20516-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I join in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, on her new honour. As has been said, as president of Canning House, she has worked assiduously to improve relations between this country and Latin America. She must be very pleased about the happy coincidence of the honour bestowed on her, today's debate, and the very high profile now assumed by relations between the European Union and Latin America, as demonstrated by tomorrow's prime ministerial-level meeting in Madrid. I understand that, as has been said, that meeting will be starting at 9 am ma&#241;ana.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para19"></a>Perhaps I can illustrate the work done by the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, by giving one small example. After a parliamentary delegation of which I was a member returned from Bolivia, a group of us, with the noble Baroness, held a meeting with the director of the British Museum, to see whether we could ensure that the right contacts were being made with the Andean ambassadors in relation to the creation of a gallery of Andean civilisation. We shall be delighted to see that project going forward soon. Incidentally, Bolivia is, I think, the one country that straddles Mercosur and the Andean Pact. Cultural tourism in the Andes is not yet quite the thing for the grey generation, but I am quite sure that it will develop as one of the most sought-after experiences.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para20"></a>As I am mentioning distinguished colleagues in this field, I am delighted to see that my speech will be followed by that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, who could forget 99 per cent of what he knows about the subject and still know a lot more about it than I do.
<P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para21"></a>Following preceding comments, I shall briefly contrast Bolivia with Colombia. When we were in Bolivia, it was said that the elimination of coca growing by the peasants, and the reduction of smuggling of the drug, was costing the country 500 million dollars annually in lost trade. The EU and the US helped fill the gap of 500 million dollars by giving 50 million dollars each.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para22"></a>While we were in Bolivia Plan Colombia was announced under which the US provided 3 billion dollars to Colombia. Some Bolivians asked us rather plaintively, indeed, rather resentfully, "Do we have to cause as much trouble as Colombia to get that sort of money"? I am afraid that the answer is "Yes". It is rather like the upside down world experienced recently in the Balkans where the EU is still spending 1 billion euros on aid but 5 billion euros a year on ongoing military security expenditure. The Foreign Secretary and the United Nations have adopted an imaginative new outlook as regards the new programme of considering failing states before they become a mess. That constitutes an important challenge to the world community; namely, how to approach such a matter with some delicacy as we cannot always sweep up at enormous expense when the real job is to make sure that good governance is taken forward. I pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, as regards Bolivia and the Andes, where the key to success concerns the economics of alternative employment.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para23"></a>It has been said that the developments between the EU and Latin America are reversing the famous Canning dictum which states, if I may paraphrase, that the time has come for the old world of Europe to redress the balance of dominance in Latin America of the United States. That is certainly an idea whose time has come. I argue that the model of Europe&#151;in my case that of Jacques Delors although that does not reflect everyone's view&#151;is far more relevant to Latin America than the American model. The social dialogue that takes place between the EU and Mercosur is a good example. There are a number of reasons for that&#151;language has been mentioned&#151;but the ethnic/religious range of experience is also relevant. That dialogue has made it easier for us to visit many of the Latin American countries. I wish to put on record the thanks of the TUC delegation that recently visited Colombia for the help provided by the Foreign Office. It is never easy to meet imprisoned trade union leaders.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para24"></a>My limited experience leads me to believe that there is scope for greater EU cohesion&#151;I hope that the Minister will comment on the matter&#151;as regards missions in Latin America in 15 countries from 15 EU countries. I believe that that adds up to 225 delegations. We do not need so much duplication of experts on water supply, for example. Latin America could be used as a test bed as regards joint EU missions. I hope that that point will be commented on.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para25"></a>I hope that the Minister will also comment on the EU "road map". In parts of eastern, central and south eastern Europe the EU "road map" is not seen as a threat or the EU as a potential protectorate. It is rather <P>


<a name="column_497"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>like the thing that you fling in the back seat of the car that you pick up when you have lost your way. Even when you think that you are going in the right direction you occasionally look at it. I was interested to note that Chris Patten, in introducing the summit, talked about the launch of the euro, the common foreign and security policy and the beginnings of autonomous military capacity in Europe. He mentioned those matters alongside an enormous range of events leading up to the summit in Madrid and the negotiation of association agreements between the EU and Mercosur and the EU and Chile and so on.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para26"></a>I refer to Argentina in comparison with Brazil. I very much echo the comments of my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester in that regard. However, it was not so long ago that we did not make any distinction between Argentina and Brazil. President Cardoso was in London recently. I refer to a most fascinating presentation at Canning House showing the enormous social progress and the doubling of productivity and of social provision in Brazil in the past 10 years when inflation was 40 per cent at the start of that period. It now has virtually 100 per cent education provision and AIDS is declining. It would be useful to discuss how some of the elements of that successful model could form part of the EU contribution at the summit to promote the development in a positive direction of all of the economies of Latin America.

<A NAME="20516-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Swynnerton: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, whose remarks about the desirability of Latin America following a European example seem to me to deserve much attention.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para27"></a>I had the distinct impression that when I had the honour of joining your Lordships' House some 21 years ago the only contact there seemed to be between Latin America and this legislature at Westminster was a distant recollection of a comparison made by Disraeli who said that the Treasury Bench in another place reminded him of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"one of those marine landscapes not very uncommon on the coasts of South America. You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes, and ever and anon the dark rumbling of the sea".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-17_para28"></a><P>

<a name="20516-17_para29"></a>The late Lord Beaconsfield, I should advise your Lordships, had more imagination than experience of Latin America. Things have changed. Judging from the number of distinguished noble Lords who are taking part in this debate, matters have changed radically. Some noble Lords may recall the commercial relations of this country in the 18th century when more Members of this House were shareholders of a South Sea company specially designed to trade with the Spanish empire than were not, but most of us will think of more modern and desirable commercial opportunities for the present.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para30"></a>Some of us, especially those interested in an ethical foreign policy, will recall how Britain led the way in the 19th century to end the slave trade to Latin America and may even recall that Lord Palmerston was wont to <P>


<a name="column_498"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say in his last years that the one thing he was really proud of was ending the slave trade to Brazil. Many noble Lords will recall&#151;as did the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan&#151;how Canning helped Spanish American independence. Others will recall the number of British volunteers who fought for Boli&#237;var, particularly in Venezuela at the battle of Carabobo. Others will remember how a Member of this House no less, Lord Dundonald, when he was Admiral Cochrane, founded the navies of two Latin American countries.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para31"></a>Other noble Lords will be reminded when thinking of Argentina how once that country was considered to be the sixth dominion and others&#151;this has been touched on&#151;will not be oblivious of the fact that the oil of Mexico carried here by Lord Cowdray seemed to secure victory in the First World War. I am even tempted to remember how two Lords, the third Lord Albermarle and his brother, Admiral Lord Keppel, captured Havana in 1762 and launched Cuba on a rapid era of economic development. I shall address that subject in a lecture in Havana later this year.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para32"></a>We know that Latin America is composed of old if not always of close friends. As for the future I have eight matters which we should think about in relation to this fascinating continent. First, the history which I have mentioned should be remembered by officials, politicians and businessmen as, for Latin Americans, the history of the British and European relations with Latin America in the past will not be forgotten. Secondly, we should be inspired by the fact that, despite border disputes and a reputation for violence in Latin America and despite refugees, which have been mentioned, interstate wars have practically never occurred. It seems to me that the last interstate war in Latin America was the War of the Pacific in the 1880s, unless we include&#151;I do not really think that we should&#151;Castro's attempts to overthrow other Latin American countries by terror in the 1960s.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para33"></a>We might also note that despite the fact that there is a multitude of peoples in Latin America&#151;I believe that there are more than 50 separate peoples in Mexico alone, speaking different Indian languages&#151;there is remarkable racial harmony. The Zapotecs and Mixtecs in Mexico might well be able to give Europeans a lesson in harmony. I refer not only to the Balkans. Race relations in general also continue to be relatively harmonious, even in Brazil and Cuba, which have large black populations. Even before the revolution, and probably after it, Cuba has had a relatively good record in terms of black/white relations.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para34"></a>I turn to literature. Surely someone should mention it. The great writers of Latin America include, for example, the late Octavio Paz, Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes and Guillermo Cabrera Infante, a Cuban Englishman whose naturalisation papers I had the honour to sign. All of them exert considerable influence over the intellect and the imagination of Europeans.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para35"></a>Where too would Europe be, I ask noble Lords, without Latin American music, from the bolero to the salsa?

<a name="20516-17_para36"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, referred to the Aztec exhibition, which will be held in the Royal Academy later this year. In saying that noble Lords should go and see it, I should declare an interest: one of my sons, Isambard, designed the catalogue and I myself have written an essay for it.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para37"></a>I should refer to Mercosur and drugs, to new democracies and to new opportunities for commercial undertakings. Although I probably could do so, I shall leave that to others. In the short time that I have at my disposal, I conclude by recalling a point that is perhaps equally important. There was a 17th-century saying in Spain that if someone is very good mannered, they are as polite as a Mexican Indian. This House believes that manners make the man. That courtesy, so characteristic of Latin Americans, is now not confined to Indians but extends through all parts of the racial make-up of the continent. That is another reason why we should feel pleased and proud of our growing affectionate attachment to our Latin American cousins.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I never thought that I would be able to lay claim to the mantle of Disraeli. However, I speak of Latin America with more enthusiasm, if not imagination, than expertise. It is particularly daunting to follow such a magnificent tour de force, delivered in such celebratory language. The spirit of this debate is celebratory indeed. I join other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Baroness on a magnificent honour, which is magnificently deserved. It is good to share in that this evening.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para38"></a>I am afraid that almost immediately I shall plunge the House into gloom. I thank the noble Baroness for giving us an opportunity to voice celebration and concern about the future of Latin America. As many noble Lords have said, this debate takes place during turbulent times. Even if we had not had the coincidence of the Madrid Summit, this would have been an extremely timely moment at which to discuss Latin America.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para39"></a>Far be it from me to talk about Europe&#151;that has already been magnificently covered&#151;but the European Union has been building links with Latin America since its inception. During the past decade we have celebrated and rejoiced as Latin America and Europe have grown closer together&#151;we have doubled our trade and we have begun to build up agreements with Mexico, in particular, Chile and of course Mercosur. Those are the foundations for a much better future.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para40"></a>It is not simply in response to their roles as major trading partners that we should be concerned about the collapse of the Argentinian economy, the peace talks in Colombia or the chaos in Venezuela. We should also reflect on what those traumatic events mean for our international and Atlantic relationships and our hopes for building stronger civil societies. Even without the Madrid Summit we should surely be concerned, if we are to meet our own international <P>


<a name="column_500"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development targets, that after a decade of reform and democracy income equalities are still widening across Latin America. Two in five people in Latin America live on less than two US dollars a day&#151;that is, 168 million people&#151;and 77 million of them live on less than one US dollar a day. Moreover, 80 per cent of all the indigenous people fall into that category. Fuelling that continuing poverty, particularly in Central America, is the failure to ensure that education reaches the poorest.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para41"></a>The debate asks the Government what role they intend to play in the summit. I believe&#151;I absolutely follow the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, in this respect&#151;that we should ensure that at the first opportunity the summit should celebrate and promote the great economic and social diversity. Far more people know about the violence and the salsa than about the great liberal traditions and the great literature. It should also make it crystal clear that investment in Latin America&#151;and in greater social protection and civil society&#151;is not an act of international charity but a global safeguard. The EU's own five-year regional strategy document makes it clear that the political challenge internally in Latin America is to consolidate democracy and the rule of law and that the international challenge is to encourage the capacity of the countries of the region to take a more active part in international policy.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para42"></a>Those must be the priorities, because unless Latin American countries become more involved in international discourse and international action, we will never win against international terrorism or global poverty, as we want to do. We need the intelligence, the humanity and the practical experience that Latin America can bring in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para43"></a>I hope that the UK would will work hard to ensure that the summit takes every opportunity to respond to the "deepening gloom" across Latin America. I hope that we will make a positive and optimistic response to that by taking the lead in promoting an enhanced commitment to building democracy. It is time to reinforce what we can do. For 10 years we have rejoiced in the growing democracies. That would not have been possible without the courage and determination of the people of Chile, Venezuela or Argentina. The agreements that we have created bear witness to the relationship between economic growth and democracy in the democratic clauses that are attached to the agreements.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para44"></a>However, the reality check is that after decades of collaboration and support, economic growth has not meant better lives for the poorest. Human rights, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, still have a fragile hold in many countries in Latin America. The d&#233;b&#226;cle in Venezuela, with the attempted overthrow of President Ch&#225;vez, the continuing trauma in Argentina and the festering corruption and violence witnessed in Central America are all evidence of how fragile those democracies are. I endorse all of the calls that have been made for us to stand by Argentina as best we can.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para45"></a>I hope that our Government will take every opportunity at the summit to raise the confidence of European investors as a whole, but also to commit to <P>


<a name="column_501"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a practical and realistic programme with robust systems of accountability, particularly for technical, social and educational assistance.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para46"></a>I hope that we will give a special priority to educational assistance. Unless we do that, neither aid nor trade will ultimately make a difference in the long run. The needs are immense: more resources for more schools, particularly in the rural areas; more teachers and teacher trainers; more vocational trainers; more technicians and engineers; more advisers; and more appropriate technologies. In the short term I think of the gifted and dedicated Argentinian teachers I know. They look to Europe for advice and support. Although they are now living off their savings, they continue to teach, despite not having been paid, because they know that the future of their children is their only future. I think of the very bright children whom I have seen in remote areas of Guatemala and Honduras who are taught in schools which have bare walls, a few benches and hardly any resources to speak of and yet who believe that the future is for them. Therefore, I hope that the summit will make a priority of meeting their human rights through education.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para47"></a>I also hope that it will recognise that attaching a democracy clause to trade agreements means having to take action when there are defaults on human rights. I hope that it will mobilise the range of investment that is needed for greater equality as well as greater growth. Above all, I hope that Chris Patten is right when he says that the summit,

<A NAME="20516-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, on receiving her honour and on initiating such a wide-ranging and timely debate. I hope that she feels rewarded by the knowledge that has been deployed in the debate and by the evident interest in and feeling for Latin America that has been displayed by all who have spoken so eloquently about its needs.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para49"></a>In this country, despite our recognition of Latin America's trading importance and our interest, and the interest of successive governments, in promoting democracy and human rights there, too often, after the high drama has been played out, the press loses interest. Therefore, I believe that this debate is valuable, coming as it does on the eve of the most welcome Spanish initiative in holding the Euro-Latin American Summit in Madrid. It gives Europe an opportunity to develop the co-operation which was begun across a wide front on foundations laid in Rio in June 1999.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para50"></a>The EU is the first trading partner of Mercosur, Chile and the Andean group. The decade from 1990 saw a doubling of European Union trade with Latin America, with exports from Europe reaching 54.5 million euros. European firms have played a significant role in the privatisation process. Between 1996 and 1999 the European Union became the largest source of direct investment in Latin America.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para51"></a>We also welcome the progress in the negotiations on liberalising trade. Those have already extended to agricultural exports with Mercosur and Chile. I hope that, in replying, the Minister will be able to say something on the progress made in the April talks in Buenos Aires, particularly on political co-operation and trade facilitation measures.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para52"></a>With regard to Mercosur, I simply say that its objectives seem entirely admirable. I slightly regret that it has followed almost exclusively an intergovernmental approach, not following the European pattern of initiatives from a body comparable to the Commission. I believe that that has resulted in it being somewhat slower to achieve its goals than might otherwise have been the case.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para53"></a>Turning to the Madrid summit, I notice in the letter sent to all the participating heads of government that our own Prime Minister was asked by Prime Minister Aznar to introduce the subject of international terrorism. I hope that Tony Blair will tackle not only terrorism in that context but also the causes of terrorism, for that is where I believe the European Union has a particular role to play in Latin America.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para54"></a>In a debate as brief as this, it is difficult to decide whether to do a complete tour d'horizon&#151;a historical analysis as brilliant as that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas&#151;or to decide where to point the searchlight. I am afraid that I have felt it necessary to focus particularly upon the parlous condition of Argentina. Its spectacular debt default in December casts a lurid light over the scene, and it is the most present destabilising threat to the continent, which has, to some extent understandably, resisted the worst of the fall-out.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para55"></a>It would be hard to exaggerate the awfulness of the Argentinian financial disaster. However, I believe that there are some parallels with the Russian default of 1998. But Argentina appears to lack a President Putin to face down corrupt provincial oligarchs and governors whose attitudes to public spending, failure to collect taxes and willingness to print provincial money threatens hyper-inflation&#151;perhaps as high as 60 per cent this year&#151;and a massive decline in GDP, possibly by as much as 11 per cent this year. The hardship that that involves scarcely needs to be spelled out to the House.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para56"></a>The IMF, which has bailed out Argentina before without securing the required reforms, has no choice but to insist on the necessary painful disciplines. Argentina's federal government must refuse the bail-out money to the provincial governments. An anti-corruption campaign must be mounted and with urgency, taking on the tainted judges, congressmen, civil servants and others who have sapped confidence in the ability of the country to govern itself.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para57"></a>Order must be restored to the banking system, the payments system and the foreign exchange market. Economy Minister Lavagna needs all the technical help that he can find from the international community, and particularly from the European Union&#151;his most important trading partner. The need is to restore investor confidence. The role of private <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>capital is the key to this resource-rich country and not another bail-out from the IMF. The bankruptcy code needs to be reformed and creditors need to be able to recover their assets. However, what has been called the "standard cold turkey approach" is unlikely to succeed unless domestic and international confidence is restored by the active involvement in that process of internationally respected monitors and advisers&#151;here, again, Europe could play its part, perhaps through members of the Bank for International Settlements&#151;reporting to the Argentinians and the world that the painful adjustments are being made.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para58"></a>Russia has shown that short-term pain can quite quickly lead to a real turn-round. If the pitfalls of the quick fix are to be avoided and if investment is to be resumed, workers must become profit-sharers and equity holders. Privatised business must cease to be monopolistic.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para59"></a>Finally, I draw attention to the wise words of Anne Krueger, the deputy managing director of the IMF, spoken less than a week ago when she drew attention to the importance in the context of Argentina of strengthening,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the social safety net at this time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-17_para60"></a>
That is where the public funding must not be cut. I have no doubt that, in the talks in Madrid, our Government will seek to impart to their European partners the urgency which is required to save that great nation and rich country from economic, social and political collapse.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-17_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I, too, extend my appreciation to my noble friend Baroness Hooper for initiating this debate. I congratulate her on her timing and her very well-deserved honour.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para61"></a>It is always so worth while listening to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, who has such a wealth of expertise and experience in this area, and to the other well-informed and interesting contributions from all noble Lords who have spoken during the debate.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para62"></a>Summits such as this one are essential in building on the cultural and economic relationships that we are forming with Latin America. The first summit of leaders from the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, which took place in Brazil in 1999, marked the start of a new strategic partnership. It increased mutual understanding in the political, economic and cultural spheres.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para63"></a>The objective then was to strengthen political, economic and cultural understanding between the two regions in order to encourage further development. It is therefore timely that in the coming days we shall have the opportunity to evaluate the progress since the Rio summit and to set the direction for the future of the partnership. It is also timely as the European Union has undergone a significant transformation with the launch of the euro in 12 member states.
<P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para64"></a>Over the past few years, the European Union has gradually deepened its economic and trade links with Latin America, at a bilateral level with Mexico and Chile and at a regional level with the "Mercado del Sur" or Mercosur. Indeed, the European Union is Latin America's second trading partner, being the first partner for Mercosur and Chile. We have enjoyed close links with Mercosur since its creation in 1991, witnessing the process of regional integration between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and providing technical and institutional support. That has resulted in a doubling of trade between 1990 and 2000. Trade at the bilateral level has also been nurtured. As neither Mexico nor Chile belong to any regional Latin American groups, they have developed stronger bilateral links with the European Union. Mexico is the only country on the American continent actually to have signed a European free-trade agreement with the European Union.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para65"></a>However, we have also heard that while much progress has been made, the continent is now facing a serious financial crisis and economic instability. Argentina, which, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, is a wonderful country with educated people, is going through a difficult period. There has been a 70 per cent fall in the value of the peso since the 11-year peg to the US dollar was ended in January, which has sent the prices of imported goods soaring. According to a survey by the Argentine business chamber, CAME, the prices of fresh eggs and vegetable oils, as well as the prices of computers and televisions, have risen by between 100 per cent and 200 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para66"></a>The new Argentinian Government have devalued their currency by at least 30 per cent in order to boost exports and to help restore Argentina's foreign currency earnings, which may be needed to pay off huge foreign debts. There is an unfortunate consequence, however, for those businesses that have invested in Argentina and which may now suffer as their investments in the country become less valuable. I fully support my noble friend Lady Hooper and the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, in saying that we should help Argentina in whatever way we can to overcome her present problems.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para67"></a>In contrast to its regional peers, the Peruvian economy is pulling clear from a recession. Last year it even managed to edge out a slight increase in growth. So far, however, the recovery remains based on two singular events: the ramp-up of commercial production at the Antamina copper-zinc mine, which is on its way to becoming one of the country's largest mining operations, and additional public spending. That in no way represents an economic recovery, so it is with sadness that at this stage the Government see fit to close the CDC office in Peru.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para68"></a>The European Union needs to maintain a close relationship with Latin America if we are to continue to have a major and positive effect on improving economic and social development. There is a risk that governments will become distracted by the financial crisis, creating an opportunity for an increase in drug <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trafficking, money laundering, drug abuse, organised crime and, of course, terrorism, as we heard from my noble friend Lord Moynihan.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para69"></a>The European Commissioner, Chris Patten, was right when he said that the Madrid summit,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"represents the opportunity to build upon the common foundations which we put in place at Rio and to launch specific and ambitious initiatives to strengthen our ties".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-17_para70"></a>
The summit will provide a high-profile platform to make a substantial joint contribution to stabilising the international environment, economically as well as politically. We on this side of the House look forward to the Minister's response and a further Statement on the summit. We also hope that the Government will play an active and a supportive role at the Madrid summit, not only to further economic and cultural links, but to bring stability to the region.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, we have had an extremely interesting and wide-ranging debate. If this were a sermon for which I needed a text, my noble friend Lord Brennan has provided me with one. He described the countries concerned in this debate as countries of "much difficulty but great hope". I am grateful to him for that text as it sums up a number of contributions.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para71"></a>I also congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper. By now she must be feeling embarrassed by the adulation. She said that the timing of the debate was a pure coincidence. As well as her knowledge of Latin America I thought that maybe she had considerable skills in persuading the powers that be to hold an appropriate debate on an appropriate day. She could not have picked a better day.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para72"></a>Foreign ministers of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean countries have already gathered in Madrid for a meeting this evening. Tomorrow, the full summit of heads of state and government will begin. During the summit the EU will be holding separate meetings with representatives from the Mercosur countries, the Central American and Andean states and Mexico, as well as individual meetings with many countries&#151;noble Lords will agree that they are important countries&#151;including the Caribbean.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para73"></a>Heads of state and heads of government from 48 countries will be at Madrid, together with foreign ministers and other representatives. It struck me that in replying to this debate, with 48 countries and 12 minutes in which to reply, I could speak for 25 seconds on each country. Mercifully not every country has been referred to. As the House will know, my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Denis MacShane, are representing the Government.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para74"></a>I want to speak about the importance of Latin America and the Caribbean to this country. Our strong historical ties, have been emphasised by many speakers&#151;I shall not try to add to what has been said&#151;most notably by the noble Lords, Lord Thomas and Lord Moynihan, and my noble friend Lord <P>


<a name="column_506"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Brennan. We have heard a tremendous depth of history and experience that we would do well to remember.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para75"></a>Our current relationship is driven by a renewed emphasis on modern political, cultural and economic links and on significant trade with and investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. A number of noble Lords stressed the importance of the economy and of trade, particularly my noble friends Lord Lea, Lord Faulkner and Lord Brennan. Annually, our exports are worth some &#163;2.5 billion and the list of British companies operating in the region reads like an A-Z of the FTSE 100. Brazil and Mexico are particularly important for UK exports.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para76"></a>Political links with Latin America continue to grow. Between May 1997 and the end of 2000, over 70 British ministerial visits to the region took place. My noble friend Lord Lea rightly reminded me that not only are ministerial visits important, but also trade union visits and others. Last summer, the Prime Minister took relations an important step further when he visited Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and had an extremely important meeting with Caribbean leaders in Kingston, Jamaica.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para77"></a>With Brazil and Mexico, bilateral ties have been given additional impetus by regular high-level talks covering a range of global and regional issues. Brazil and Mexico are not just key players in Latin America. Their population growth and the size of their economy makes them increasingly important global players.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para78"></a>Of course, there are problems. The issue of drugs was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. There are also the problems of human rights and conflict resolution. They are important matters in our relationships with Latin America and the Caribbean. Drugs-related terrorism of both the left and the right threaten democracy in Colombia and could spill over into neighbouring countries. The influence of drugs and drug-related crime has dramatically affected the economic and political stability of the Caribbean, most notably in Jamaica. We all share a common interest in ensuring that the men of violence do not prosper and that democracy and the rule of law prevail. The importance of democratic institutions was repeatedly stressed, and rightly so, by my noble friend Lady Andrews.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para79"></a>Our relationship with the Caribbean region is as strong as ever. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary paid full testament to the strength of that relationship in his opening remarks at the recent UK-Caribbean Forum in Guyana earlier this year. He underlined our readiness to engage with our friends in the Caribbean to tackle the many challenges that we face. The forum agreed to take forward work in a number of key areas: regional security; trade and investment; sustainable development; and health, especially the spread of HIV/AIDS.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para80"></a>I turn to the purpose of the summit. It is the second event of its kind, following the first three years ago in Rio. I can give an absolute assurance&#151;almost every speaker asked for an assurance on this point, and it is nice when one can stand at this Box and, hopefully, <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>give an absolute assurance&#151;that the Government attach tremendous importance to the summit and to the work that we hope that it will undertake.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para81"></a>To recap on some of the events since the last summit, Rio gave political impetus to trade negotiations with Mexico, leading to entry into force of the EU-Mexico Association Agreement in October 2000. It also gave impetus to negotiations with Chile, the conclusion of which will be celebrated in Madrid&#151;a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper. Other examples of co-operation since Rio include human rights, higher education and many other important issues that time does not allow me to enumerate. My noble friend Lady Andrews mentioned the importance of education. The first EU-Latin America and Caribbean Ministerial Conference on Higher Education was held in Paris in November 2000.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para82"></a>The summit's principal purpose will be to give political impetus to the process of building a deeper strategic relationship between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean. That relationship will centre on the key issues where both regions have mutual interests and concerns. Those can be summarised under three headings that will provide the timetable and framework for the summit: political, economic and cultural, and there will be one session on each. Of course, we cannot anticipate precisely what the summit will endorse, but we hope that there will be a political declaration, a paper on common values, and an assessment of progress made on projects since the last summit.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para83"></a>We have a real incentive for the summit to produce some practical commitments from everyone taking part. We want discussion at Madrid to focus on areas where the two regions can work together and can make a real difference. We want heads of government to agree to undertake a series of commitments that will benefit both regions that, above all, will be relevant to the interests and well-being of ordinary citizens in the two regions. That undertaking will form the political declaration to which I referred.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para84"></a>The summit agenda is ambitious. Four areas are especially important to us and we very much hope that commitments in those areas will form part of the final communiqu&#233;. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, asked about the summit's objectives, and I shall touch on those four key ones. They are, first, terrorism and the international response to it. That will be no surprise to noble Lords. The second is agreement on moving forward on further world trade liberalisation following the Doha meeting. The third is agreement to work together to make a difference on sustainable development, not least in the run-up to the World Summit in Johannesburg. The fourth is the encouragement of more investment in the Latin American and Caribbean regions&#151;never forgetting, as my noble friend Lady Andrews said, that it is not just a question of achieving economic growth but of ensuring that it is sustainable and coupled with strategies for the elimination of poverty.
<P>


<a name="column_508"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column 508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para85"></a>Throughout the preparation process, we have worked to keep those four areas in focus and to ensure that they receive adequate attention at the summit. As I said, we have agreed the themes for discussion, but of course not all countries approach the summit in exactly the same way. Some Caribbean countries are especially concerned that we should pay more attention to the special problems that their economies face. Some Latin American and Caribbean countries would like new trade agreements with the EU. There are calls for a greater EU commitment on aid to the region and a recognition that the disbursement of aid, especially in the Caribbean, needs to be speeded up and made more effective. Those are all complicated economic and political issues and we hope that they will get a good airing at Madrid.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para86"></a>As was no surprise to anyone interested in the region, several speakers mentioned the problems of Argentina. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, described the situation well when he said that it is hard to exaggerate the awfulness of the economic disaster that has overtaken the region. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, spelt out some of the consequences and tremendous difficulties caused by inflation.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para87"></a>The Government are watching the economic crisis in Argentina with much concern. We support the efforts of President Duhalde's government to tackle the serious problems that they face. We have stressed to Argentina that it must do all that it can to carry through a sound and sustainable economic policy consistent with the criteria set out by the International Monetary Fund. We recognise that that may take time; no one underestimates the scale of the challenge that Argentina faces.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para88"></a>I must say a word about the Caribbean. A key issue for the Caribbean is, of course, sustainable development. The region has requested our help in representing their concerns about the lack of attention that they receive in addressing their development needs. The UK is therefore pleased that sustainable development features prominently on the agenda for the summit and we look forward to the discussions, which we hope will lead to a greater awareness of the concerns of small states and allay the sense of marginalisation which Caribbean leaders have reported.
<P>

<a name="20516-17_para89"></a>Latin America and the Caribbean matter greatly to the UK and I hope that I have been able to reassure all those who have spoken in the debate in the short time that I have had. I welcome the opportunity provided by the debate for me and others to spell out the importance that we all attach to the region. We look forward to developing new and closer links with all the countries of the region. We want to work together to tackle some of the international problems and challenges that we will face this decade. We welcome the opportunity offered by the Madrid summit to make progress on those matters.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Skelmersdale) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Skelmersdale): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in the Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para0"></a>I should explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-18_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  I am sure that I, along with other noble Lords, may make procedural mistakes. I hope that I shall have the indulgence of the Committee if I do.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para1"></a>Before we embark on the business of the Committee, I wish to make an apology, particularly to Members of the Opposition Benches. On behalf of the Government, I apologise sincerely for the fact that so many Government amendments appeared on the Order Paper on Monday. I am acutely aware of the serious inconvenience that this will have caused noble Lords and I accept that it is completely at odds with the practice of the House.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para2"></a>Apart from the provisions in relation to children in respect of whom care is shared&#151;these are the provisions I promised the noble Earl, Lord Russell, at Second Reading that we would come back with&#151;these are technical amendments and drafting changes to improve the clarity of the Bill. The changes result from technical clarifications in the early part of the Bill. The amendments are numerous because similar consequential changes had then to be repeated in a number of different clauses. Many of those changes follow the splitting of Clause 17, which would otherwise have become unwieldy.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para3"></a>It was not possible to table parts of the package of changes earlier because the technical points are inter-related. I am afraid that the need for these amendments came to light after the Bill had been considered in another place. This is a highly technical Bill and, despite all the efforts of counsel and officials, the amendments were not ready to be tabled earlier.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para4"></a>We first gave priority to tabling amendments that made substantive changes, such as those in relation to appeals and to the annual review of the value of tax credit, and also&#151;this was extremely, but rightly, time-consuming&#151;to making draft regulations available to assist understanding of the Bill well in advance of Committee.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para5"></a>I am most grateful for the co-operation shown by noble Lords in rearranging the timing of Committee days. We, on our side, are trying to do as much as we can to minimise the difficulty these late amendments have caused. I have made available my speaking notes on the technical amendments. I am happy to arrange briefing meetings with officials to talk through those technical amendments, or to write to noble Lords with more detail. I am happy to flood noble Lords with as much paper as they can possibly manage.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para6"></a>Nevertheless, I fully accept that it is unacceptable for amendments to be tabled so late and in such numbers. The Paymaster General, Dawn Primarolo, wishes to join with me in offering our most sincere apologies for what has happened.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am sure that the Committee would wish to accept the Minister's very gracious apology. After more than 35 years in Parliament, I cannot quite recall anything precisely the same happening. In particular, the timing seems quite extraordinary. The matter has gone right the way through the House of Commons without any second thoughts being expressed on behalf of the Government. As the Minister rightly said, the amendments were tabled only at the very last minute, with the result that the Committee's session on Tuesday had to be abandoned. I fully accept the Minister's apology which, as always, is combined with the helpful way in which she provided the Committee with papers and meetings and so on. But I am not sure that we should leave the matter there.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para7"></a>The Minister is accountable to Parliament and parliamentary accountability flows through the Minister. We are not able, if something has gone wrong, to summon officials to explain what happened. This was a matter of great controversy, Members will recall, back in the mid-1980s when the Treasury and Civil Service Committee went into this matter in great depth as a result of trickledown and so on. Finally the Liaison Committee produced a report on it. Basically, what was then agreed&#151;and it is the principle on which we operate&#151;is that the Minister is accountable to this House. If something has gone wrong in the department, the Minister will carry out an investigation and explain what happened following that investigation.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para8"></a>It seems quite extraordinary, however, that these are not simply technical amendments; they are most certainly drafting amendments. It would seem that the draftsman had something of a brainstorm. At the very last stage of the Bill, as it entered your Lordships' House, he decided that the thing was structurally wrong and therefore he had to table all these amendments.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para9"></a>Whether it was one draftsman or a change in draftsmen or that the draftsmen were distracted from their business to do something else, we do not know. If this kind of thing were to happen in business life, the individual would undoubtedly feel it appropriate either to be fired or to resign. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will feel it appropriate to find out precisely what happened and perhaps come back to us again at a later stage as a result of her inquiries. I am not talking here of some junior officials. Parliamentary draftsmen used to be paid rather more than permanent secretaries and certainly much more than Ministers. Thus the matter really is quite serious. I hope that the Minister will agree&#151;as I say, we fully accept her apologies&#151;none the less to carry out further investigations so that she can tell us, because we have no means of finding out from officials, how this matter arose as it did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-18_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I thank the Minister very warmly for the trouble she has taken to help us deal with this situation as it has arisen. In particular I should like to thank her for her speaking note, which enables me&#151;I hope&#151;to make sense of what these new amendments are trying to do and to see that they are, as she assures us, innocuous and indeed possibly even rather sensible.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para10"></a>However, that is&#151;as the Italians say when two trains meet at a junction&#151;coincidenza. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I can recall such things happening before. For example, there was the Social Security Bill in 1990, on which 50 pages of government amendments were tabled on the morning of the first day in Committee. One of those, in my opinion, was so objectionable that I ended up disgracing myself by having the Chamber counted out by dividing against it at 12 midnight, the Minister having resisted my invitation to defer dividing until Report stage. I can say only that I was consoled by the opinion of the Court of Appeal on that matter that the Secretary of State's interpretation of the clause was so unreasonable that Parliament cannot possibly have intended it.
<P>

<a name="20516-18_para11"></a>It reminded me of the delightful case of the judge's children who saw crate after crate of champagne being carried into the house and asked, "Mummy, what's that for?". Reply: "Daddy's been upheld in the Appeal Court!". So I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that the fact that these particular amendments are not ones that we should make a meal of does not mean that this is something that we should accept as being capable of becoming normal practice. It is, after all, Parliament, not parliamentary counsel, that makes the law. It is not my fault that it makes the law.

<a name="20516-18_para12"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, has asked questions in the past about the chain of accountability of parliamentary counsel. Those are not our business as a Committee, but they are points that may concern us as individuals in the future. I am sure the Minister will be at one with the rest of us in saying that, however good her own record on this&#151;and it is absolutely excellent and I congratulate her on it&#151;we should not allow the matter to rest. It should not happen, again because next time it might not happen under quite so good a Minister.

<A NAME="20516-19_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I would be very grateful if the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, would not persist with this amendment. It deals with a matter which, in the words of Section 1(2) of the Parliament Act 1911, is to be settled solely by
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-19_para0"></a>
I am certain that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is a quite old enough hand to have had no such intention, but I am also certain that he is a quite old enough hand to know that one is not always interpreted according to one's own intention. It is not as widely appreciated as it should be that quarrels between the Houses are extremely difficult to resolve because there is no authority with power over the two Houses, both sovereign over their own procedure. They are therefore not to be lightly bridged. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will go no further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Had the noble Earl allowed me to finish my sentence, I would have been able to explain precisely what I had in mind in tabling this amendment. The noble Earl suspected, I believe, that I was in some way going to criticise Mr Speaker. After 33 years in the House of Commons, that is not something I am likely to do. On the contrary, it seemed to me that Mr Speaker's decision was admirable and one on which he ought to be congratulated.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para1"></a>There is not the slightest doubt, if one consults Erskine May, that whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not is entirely a matter for Mr Speaker, as the noble Earl <P>


<a name="column_CWH5"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rightly says. If he decides it is a Money Bill, then it is a Money Bill; if he decides that it is not a Money Bill, then it is not a Money Bill.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para2"></a>The only reason I tabled this amendment was to stress, as my noble friend Lord Saatchi has stressed, that the more this House can participate on matters financial, the better it may be. Certainly, if Mr Speaker had decreed that this was a Money Bill, then the whole of Part 2 would have received no parliamentary consideration. However, it has been decided that it is not a Money Bill and therefore we can proceed in this Committee.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para3"></a>My only point in relation to the amendment is that I was not absolutely clear, when I first saw the Bill, which parts of it were outside the remit of a Money Bill and therefore led to the determination that it was not a Money Bill. Can the Minister enlighten us on that? I understand that the advice is that there is nothing wrong with this amendment. Criticising Mr Speaker is the last thing I would do. The decision he has made is in every way admirable and enables us to look at this Bill constructively. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20516-19_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, with impeccable care, has dropped his match outside the box of gunpowder. I am extremely relieved that he has done so, though not particularly surprised. However, if one carries matches and lights them, and then starts a general debate in the neighbourhood of a box of gunpowder, the likelihood of the flame spreading to one or two places where they might not be quite so welcome is by no means negligible. I believe that we discuss matters such as this at our peril. If the amendment were carried it would have absolutely no effect as the decision is, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins rightly said, entirely one for the Speaker the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para4"></a>If we were to push the amendment to a vote on Report and carry it, it would change absolutely nothing whatever. I cannot therefore see that it is a necessary, valuable use of the Committee's time. In general, the view of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that we have something to contribute on financial law, is one with which I have some sympathy, but I do not believe that this amendment is a useful or particularly wise way of proceeding with it. I hope that when we come to Report stage it will not be tabled again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   All that I need do is to confirm what both noble Lords have said, which is that the decision as to what is a Money Bill is exclusively a matter for the Speaker. The amendment is defective because it alleges that the provisions of this Bill are concerned only with the imposition. The Bill also includes child benefit transfer matters, which would rule it out of classification as a Money Bill whatever the situation. I believe that that answers the particular point of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, of whether there were matters in this Bill which would by definition rule it outside the classification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 6, after first "credit" insert "or benefit"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-19_para7"></a><P>

<a name="20516-19_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5. These amendments relate to the wording in Clause 1, which makes radical changes to the Governments' proposal with regard to the whole tax credit scheme. It is suggested that after the first tax credit we should insert the words "or benefit", and similarly in the following line.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para9"></a>It is our contention that the terminology used by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has a passion for tax credits in every conceivable form, is not entirely appropriate as far as this Bill is concerned, although we have of course deferred the decision on the title until later. Effectively, many of the payments which will be made under this Bill are not tax credits at all. They are not credited against people's tax for the simple reason that they are not bound to pay any tax. Therefore it is a confusion to use the expression "tax credit".
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para10"></a>As I pointed out at Second Reading, this is not a proper tax credit scheme of the negative income tax kind which was proposed as long ago as 1972. This is simply an abuse of terminology as far as concerns much of the payments under this Bill. Perhaps the Minister can tell us&#151;no doubt we will return to this point at various stages in our proceedings&#151;what percentage of the amounts paid out under this Bill is expected to be deducted from tax and what percentage is simply going to be paid out as benefits, otherwise there is likely to be very considerable confusion in the terminology.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para11"></a>The other aspect of the matter is that, by calling them tax credits, the Government seek to give the appearance that the amount of public expenditure on social security benefits is less than it is and, as a result, alter the overall position of the Government, who were elected in 1997 on an undertaking by the Prime Minister to cut the costs of social security. In fact from 1996-97 to 2003-04, there was a bigger increase in social security spending, allowing for the tax credits, than there was over the same period for either health or education.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para12"></a>Our contention is that using this terminology is misleading and inappropriate. At the very least it ought to be made clear in the course of the Bill that what is now being called a "tax credit" is in fact, to a large extent, a social security benefit. That would seem to be the very least one can do. Of course, in later amendments we will come to various specific proposals as to which tax credits are abolished, which ones are superseded, and so on. We can return to that issue when we get to the appropriate amendments. <P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>But, as far as these amendments are concerned, it would clarify the position if we were to accept them. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para13"></a>[The sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 4.21 to 4.31 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-19_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The amendment raises a couple of issues that we shall have to look at at some stage of the progress of the Bill, and this seems as appropriate a moment as any. Both of them were discussed to some extent in the Commons, but neither was brought to the point of resolution.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para14"></a>We have here two different approaches to the giving of money, one under tax and the other under social security. There are a whole collection of minor legal differences, some of which are capable of being of very practical importance. One of them is the definition of the household, which is rapidly becoming a fairly lively issue in politics these days. As the Minister knows very well, although not everybody else does, social security has from the beginning, ever since Beveridge, run on a definition of the household that relies on the couple as the common economic unit rather than on the simple fact of marriage. This has not been true of the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para15"></a>If I have followed proceedings in another place correctly, it appears that, because the child credit is a family benefit, it is going to be governed by the social security definition of a household unit, but the rest will be governed by the tax definition of a household unit. There is a case for unifying these definitions of the household unit.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para16"></a>The social security definition has worked extremely well. It is much more in line with the way the world is changing nowadays. There would be a strong case for going over to that altogether. Maybe the Minister will say that the time is not yet right for that, but times are capable of becoming rotten as well as ripe. I shall not insist on putting any dogmatic view on that before the Committee, but we ought to think about it.
<P>

<a name="20516-19_para17"></a>The other issue that arises from these two definitions&#151;the social security and the tax definitions&#151; was raised by my honourable friend Mr Webb in another place. If a benefit counts as a family benefit within the meaning of EC Council Regulation 1408/71, then it gives rise to reciprocal rights in other countries under European law. If it does not, it does not. I gather that this reciprocity applies to part of the credit but not to the rest of it. That is another issue on which I would not wish to put any dogmatic view before the Committee, but on which perhaps all of us ought to think further. I would be extremely grateful for the Minister's thoughts on this question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The Minister's thoughts on this question at the moment are largely theological rather than practical, just as we had a similar debate on the exact status when we were dealing with the introduction of the WFTC Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH8"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para0"></a>I would like to make some general points about the two amendments and then to address the specific questions that have been raised. Again, as it is Committee stage, if I have overlooked anything, I am sure that noble Lords will come back to me.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para1"></a>These amendments concern the argument that tax credits are not properly taxed, but to a large extent should be regarded as benefits. The two noble Lords who spoke previously have approached this from two slightly different angles. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said that they should be benefits because he does not regard them as being genuinely offset against tax, whereas the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is more concerned with the integration of the separate assessment for taxation&#151;the household assessment for the benefit system&#151;and how, therefore, one integrates the two in any meaningful way. The concerns come from different heresies, if I may say so, from the Government orthodoxy.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para2"></a>The aim of Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 is to re-cast them as benefits. The key point of the Bill, as with the original working families' tax credit legislation, is to overcome that distinction between tax and social security, benefits and tax credits, which these amendments seek to preserve as far as support for children is concerned.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para3"></a>At this point, perhaps I may trespass on where we may go later. One of the difficulties that divides social security from taxation, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell hinted, in practical terms is also one of the big obstacles people face when seeking to move from being out of work and then into work. That is because out-of-work benefits form one chimney of support labelled "benefits", while another chimney of benefits and tax credits is labelled "in work". The problem of porting from the one to the other, with the attendant delays and risks, mean that the perception of risk&#151;the perception that one's housing benefit may not turn up; the perception that payments for one's children may not turn up&#151;affects the decision to go into something fairly precarious&#151;work&#151;when people have been away from the labour market and now face possibly no more than modest entry wages.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para4"></a>We know what inhibits people from moving into work. It is the fear of insecurity of income; problems about best buy packages; worries that the job will sustain the additional costs which going to work will generate. That is why here we seek&#151;unlike in the original WFTC Bill which tried to strengthen financial support for families&#151;not only to add to the financial support for families, but to restructure the arrangements. Thus we are moving away from the chimneys&#151;out-of-work benefits; in-work benefits&#151;to a horizontal slice, in particular for child tax credit, which will integrate the out-of-work benefits one receives for children with the in-work benefits for children so that one can port them across the two, thus bridging the risk, the possibility of exclusion, the possibility of failure, involved in crossing that divide, which I know currently affects lone parents in particular.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para5"></a>Anything that goes to re-casting the benefit&#151;here are benefits, here is tax expenditure&#151;seriously subverts the philosophy of what this Bill seeks to do; namely, structurally&#151;not only financially&#151;to overcome the mindset that states, "This is what you get when you are out of work; this is what you get in work. There is a real problem in moving from one to the other". Structurally, that is what the Bill addresses when compared with the old Bill. It also rightly enhances support for people with children and those without children.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para6"></a>There are a number of reasons for what we seek to do. First is the presentational point about not stigmatising those who have to claim support for their children through a separate system because they are out of work. There are problems about moving to and from work. Many lone parents move to and from work several times during the course of the year, in particular when their children are young. They may stop work over the holidays. We do not want them to have to approach two different departments every time. We also want to ensure that those on the lowest incomes will gain a level of support, and we are doing that.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para7"></a>All these "peaches" of the new system have been widely welcomed by the relevant pressure groups. I am not aware that any of those groups which respond to the needs of families and children have asked us to revert back to what I have termed the "chimney" attitude towards benefits, as opposed to this portable development of a citizen's income for children.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para8"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 5, and also to the point about streamlining our new system. We are introducing two tax credits to replace the six existing and often overlapping strands of support listed in subsection (3), which we shall discuss later.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para9"></a>Amendment No. 5 would replace "both" with "all". That shows that the line of argument being advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, would add to the complexity of the current systems. It would create confusion for the sake of what I think is a debating point.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para10"></a>That is our philosophy. We want to make a structure as well as a method of financial support that delivers to the people for whom the move into work, staying in work or changing in work can be precarious. We believe that the Bill achieves that.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked me a set of particular questions. I shall give him the information I have and he can come back to me if he thinks I have not addressed all his points. I am not sure that he asked me about the number of people affected, but I shall give him the information anyway. We expect approximately 6 million families to be eligible for the new tax credits. I should like to bank that information now, because we may wish to come back to it on other amendments. My understanding is that 1.7 million of those families pay neither tax nor NICs, mainly because they are on IS and JSA. Just under a further million&#151;900,000&#151;will receive more tax credits than they will pay in tax or NICs. More than two fifths will <P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be receiving more money out through NTCs than they pay through tax or NICs. Those are the statistics on beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para12"></a>The latest estimates are that around 10 to 11 per cent of the new tax credits will score as negative taxes in 2004-05 and later years, and 89 to 90 per cent will score as public expenditure. The proportions will be slightly different in 2003-04 at about 13.5 and 86.5 per cent respectively, partly because of the way in which the transitional arrangements will work.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para13"></a>Finally, I am sure that the accountancy point will come up in later amendments but I shall try to bank some more information. On 20th February 2002, the Office for National Statistics announced that the working and child tax credits would be classified in the national accounts as negative taxation to the extent that credits are less than or equal to the tax liability of the household, and as public expenditure where credits exceed the liability. That decision is consistent with OECD guidance, which has recently been reviewed following extensive consultation, including with the UK.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para14"></a>However, in contrast to the ONS, the OECD will also be applying the same classification rules to WFTC and other current tax credits giving more consistency. I understand that the OECD's position is likely to be adopted by other international bodies.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para15"></a>I hope that I have addressed the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. If I have not done so, I shall do my best to come back on them. If I still cannot answer to his satisfaction, I shall of course write to him.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para16"></a>I do not know whether the noble Earl, Lord Russell, believes I have addressed his point, but, by going on into blue sky as to what we are trying to do with the structure, I recognise the real problems that arise in trying to integrate the theological basis of our independent taxation system with the household basis used for social security. He will recognise some of the problems that are generated as a result. I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   First, I thank the Minister for that reply. We shall give careful consideration to the point about the vertical as against the horizontal philosophy behind the tax, which she has put forward so clearly. Some further thought will be needed.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para17"></a>On the basis of the figures that the Minister has given roughly 90 per cent will not be deducted against tax and only 10 per cent will be, yet this is called a Tax Credits Bill. That seems wholly disproportionate. Ninety per cent of the amount is expenditure. The 10 per cent that is deducted against tax conceals the reality of how much the Government are spending on social security, with the result that the figures for increases in social security compared with, say, education or health are confused. This confusion would seem to affect not only the public. Part of the effect of this Bill is that it is yet another takeover bid <P>


<a name="column_CWH11"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by the Treasury&#151;that cannot seriously be denied&#151;and the role of the Department for Work and Pensions is steadily diminishing.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para18"></a>When we come to the public expenditure review, I am not clear whether the only part debated in that review is the 90 per cent and the department somehow gets away with the other 10 per cent, particularly in relation to negotiations with other departments, and has an advantage that they do not have. To the extent that the Chancellor himself is involved in this anyway, one must suspect that the allocation of resources may get somewhat distorted as a result of this.
<P>

<a name="20516-20_para19"></a>It is not at all clear, therefore, that this is other than smoke and mirrors to a large extent. The terminology is undoubtedly confusing. As I understand it, 90 per cent of it is not a tax credit but a benefit payment, and that is how it ought to be described.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We can debate this endlessly. My view is that we are seeking behind this to do two things&#151;that is, to address family poverty and to encourage people into the labour market if they currently are not. These two matters go together. We know that those who are poor are those who, very often, are lone parents or have a disability, who are out of the labour market and who, as a result, remain and linger on benefits. We also know that one of the difficulties for people going into work, particularly women&#151;and some men&#151;with relatively low intellectual capital is that entry wages going into work are something like 40 per cent of the median wages. Thus, there is a real "best buy" problem, particularly when you take into account things like childcare.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para0"></a>We want to support the move into work and to sustain those who are in low paid work through a form of tax credit. As the noble Lord will know, wages do not reflect family size and family need. The tax credits can pick up that strain and make it possible.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para1"></a>It is also the case that not only does tax credit have less of the hinterland of social security behind it, and is therefore more likely to encourage people to draw on those benefits in work, but people's individual circumstances may change quite frequently over time, both into work and out of work if you are a lone parent with young children, and also in terms of extending your hours or reducing your hours. For example, a couple may have only very modest entitlement, but if the relationship breaks up both parties, for whatever reason, may come on to it.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para2"></a>Given that, we want one consistent system that is transparent, that is portable from out of work into work, that encourages people to draw on it and that, as a result, will meet our dual objectives of addressing family poverty and supporting people in work. Trying to turn the nomenclature back to before the days of 1998 is not particularly helpful or useful. If I have addressed the substantive points about percentages and money and so on to the noble Lord's satisfaction, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   Before my noble friend addresses the points raised by the Minister, does the Minister agree that, although the Government will clearly know how much has been claimed under the tax credits for a particular financial year, the Inland Revenue will not know how much to apportion to negative tax? We will not know the amount of tax assessed to households for perhaps up to nine to 10 months after the end of the tax year. Does the Minister therefore accept that sampling and estimates will have to be made and corrected in future years in order to meet the OECD guidelines?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I shall make one further comment and then I shall not continue on the amendment. I have some difficulty in following the Minister's argument. She says that the crucial things are reducing family poverty and encouraging people into work&#151;both of which we are all in favour of. However, it is not clear to me in the least why calling it a tax credit rather than a benefit achieves either of these objectives.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para3"></a>She also seemed to imply that, if it is a benefit, there is a degree of stigma attached to it and that we should not become involved with the Department for Work and Pensions; rather we should become involved with the Treasury, whom we all love.

<a name="20516-21_para9"></a>
The first point I wish to make relates to all the following amendments in the series and concerns the use of the word "superseded". It is not clear whether this is purely a terminological expression or whether it means that, for example, the children's tax credit will be superseded by the child tax credit. If that is the case, then a crucial question arises as regards whether the actual benefit changes, or whether we are purely changing the name here. If the benefit does change, as well as the change in name, then will those who are at present receiving children's tax credit gain or lose as a result of the rather odd expression "superseded" or perhaps "supercession" of this particular children's tax credit, to be replaced by a child tax credit?

<a name="20516-21_para10"></a>What is the present position with regard to the children's tax credit; that is, that which is to be superseded? We come now to the well-known problem so far as take-up is concerned. It was pointed out a few days ago by my opposite number in the other place, Mr David Willetts, that there has been a serious problem in the take-up of the children's tax credit. As a result of that, the Treasury has probably not spent&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Did the noble Lord mean the children's tax credit? Does he mean that particular credit as opposed to any of the other ones? Could I ask him to check on that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   It would not be surprising if I am confused. If I am confused, then everyone except for the noble Baroness will be confused. That is a rather immodest remark but, at all events, I may well have got it wrong.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para11"></a>What I seek to make clear is, so far as the children's tax credit is concerned, to what extent has there been take-up, and to what extent has the department underspent? Turning to the other side of the coin, to what extent does the noble Baroness think that take-up will improve as a result of ceasing to call it the "children's tax credit" under Section 257AA and instead calling it a child tax credit? This highlights the extraordinary way in which these terms are bandied around, are created and abolished at will, so leading to general confusion. It is hard to know what the public will make of it. One cannot help but feel that this way of expressing changes is not ideal.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para12"></a>We hope that the Minister will clarify in particular what is meant by the expression "supercession" and whether there is also a change in coverage. To what extent does the Minister think we will derive any benefit from this remarkable change? It seems extraordinary that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is constantly changing these terms, with the result that there is considerable confusion. I hope that at least the Minister can explain the reason for the change and explain the particular points that I have raised. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   When I read the first page of the Bill I was rather pleased to see the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which are superseded by tax credits"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-21_para13"></a>
I thought that was a helpful explanation by the parliamentary draftsmen so that somebody who was coming to it afresh would understand what on earth the Bill was about. It is very complicated. I have heard that the aim of the new form of drafting by parliamentary counsel is to clarify and simplify matters. I thought this was a classic example of parliamentary counsel guiding a new reader through the beginning and early stages of the Bill so that they could see that these credits had a lineage. Perhaps the noble Baroness can enlighten me if I am wrong, but I thought there was nothing more sinister in it than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-21_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am grateful for the support I have just been given, and I am delighted that parliamentary counsel has been the recipient of so much praise this afternoon, under the circumstances.

<P>

<a name="20516-21_para14"></a>We had a general debate about what we are seeking to do on Second Reading, so I shall deal specifically with the amendment. The children's tax credit was introduced by the Finance Act 1999 and was expected to benefit 4.6 million families. It replaced the married couple's allowance for couples aged under 65 with an income tax relief targeted on families with children. Alongside increases in child benefit and in income support child premiums, it redirected resources towards families with children. As a result, it is worth more than twice as much as the married couple's allowance that it replaced&#151;more than &#163;10 a week more this year. The children's tax credit is gradually withdrawn from families containing a higher rate taxpayer and in such families must be claimed by the higher income partner in a couple.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para15"></a>As an income tax relief, however, the children's tax credit could only provide support to families that included a taxpayer. Its value for taxpayers on the lowest incomes was restricted by their tax liabilities. In a couple, because of the link to paying tax, it is more likely to be claimed by the man. The withdrawal of the credit for higher rate taxpayers is based on the income of the higher earning partner, working with the grain of independent taxation. One effect of this has been that families on the same joint incomes have been entitled to different amounts of children's tax credit depending on the distribution of income between the partners.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para16"></a>Those points are addressed in the design of the child tax credit, which can be claimed by taxpayers and non-taxpayers alike. It is paid direct to the main carer for children and is based on family income in all cases. Under the child tax credit, a couple with an income of &#163;40,000, however it is split between the partners, will receive that &#163;545 a year. For a single-earner couple on that level of income, that represents &#163;320 a year more than they would have received from children's tax credit. To answer the noble Lord, Lord Higgins directly, this tax credit changes the structure to that degree.
<P>

<a name="20516-21_para17"></a>The noble Lord asked about problems of take-up. I am not aware of problems of take-up with children's tax credit, which is the one he was referring to&#151;that is why I queried him. I suspect that he and his noble friend may have been probing the wider issue of WFTC take-up. My information is that at April last year, children's tax credit was worth up to &#163;10.17 and went to 4.6 million people. The Inland Revenue invited claims from taxpayers and received 3.7 million forms. Three million of those have already had their PAYE codes adjusted. That is why I have no reason to believe there is a problem here. If, on reflection, the noble Lord thinks he may be referring to WFTC take-up, of course I am happy to explore that. With those remarks, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>turn later, of course, to the issue of paper and so on. To what extent does the change from the children's tax credit to the child tax credit alter the papers? Does it alter them significantly? Furthermore, is it now the case that whereas before part of the benefit was claimed against the single person's income, all of it will now be related to the income of both parents&#151;assuming that there are two of them?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On the second point, yes. On the first, what the children's tax credit becomes is the family element in the new tax credit scheme, which tapers out at the &#163;50,000 to &#163;58,000 figure on just under a 7 per cent taper. We explored taper rates at Second Reading and we can come back to it. But the noble Lord is correct.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para0"></a>Also, I apologise to the noble Lord that I overlooked his push on me on the word "superseded", which I should perhaps put in as it was of concern to him.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para1"></a>Clause 1 is an introductory clause which encapsulates what the Bill is about. It declares that new tax credits are to be created and sets out what they replace. Technically the repeal of existing systems is effected in Schedule 6 and in the relevant secondary legislation, so no technical weight is attached to the term "superseded". As the Liberal Democrats indicated, it is a helpful description by parliamentary counsel as to the intent of the Bill. We are not amending an existing Tax Credits Bill; we are replacing the original Bill with a new one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am again grateful for that further explanation. I am right, therefore, that the expression "superseded" does not simply mean that there is a change in terminology but also that there are significant changes in the actual benefits which individuals will receive. I note that the Minister indicates assent. Again, we shall study carefully what the Minister says and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="20516-22_para3"></a><P>

<a name="20516-22_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 7 is somewhat similar to the previous amendment and we have clarified a number of points in relation to it. The question is whether or not one should clarify the position with regard to the working families' tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para5"></a>It seems quite extraordinary after five years or so of this Labour Government that we constantly have these changes. I suggest that the Chancellor suffers from rather severe myopia; that is to say, we spent many hours going through the original working families' tax credit legislation, seeking to improve it, at which stage we had assumed that it would be relatively permanent. In reality, as has been pointed out by my noble friend Lord Saatchi, the life expectancy of any of the Chancellor's tax credits is about six months.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para6"></a>Yet again, the working families' tax credit is to be superseded&#151;or, more accurately, abolished in this case&#151;and in place of it we shall get the working tax credit; another change in terminology. It is not clear why the original aspect of it could not be retained, except that the word "families" is now deleted. It seems extraordinary, however, that we should have a situation where these constant changes are made and the Committee is burdened with tackling legislation which is then effectively replaced by further legislation. Perhaps the noble Baroness can tell us exactly the reason for this change and, apart from the change in terminology, what we will gain from it and the extent to which any individual may gain. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   We spend half our time in Opposition criticising government for being inflexible. We spend the other half criticising government for changing their mind. We cannot have it both ways. The Minister is attempting a pretty far-reaching change in the way we look at the whole question of social security, taxation and support. I am entirely in sympathy with the philosophy of the attempt, but it will take a good many tries to get it right.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para7"></a>A case could be argued&#151;there are one or two examples recorded in the Commons committee proceedings where this is made clear&#151;for saying that it could possibly have been done a little more slowly so that some of the questions could have been thought out a little more before the Bill was tabled. However, for a Minister to change his mind in the face of new information cannot be regarded as a crime. I cannot help but sympathise with Keynes when he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When the facts change, I change my mind, what do you do . . .?".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="20516-22_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Keynes also said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Look after unemployment and the Budget will look after itself".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-22_para8"></a>
I think that we are reaping those rewards in the current state of the economy.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para9"></a>I can respond to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in a somewhat mechanical sense by saying this takes out the word "family". Under the existing system, working families' tax credit applies to the set of benefits available to people in work. In future, the working tax credit will be the benefit that adults attract when they are in work, whether or not they have children. That will be independent of child tax credit which will apply from being out of work and then into work. That is the technical reason why we are changing the terminology. We are deconstructing the original "chimney" and approaching this horizontally. Thus working tax credit will apply to the adult element.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para10"></a>I could go beyond those words and give the noble Lord a fuller answer. However, given the general support for the principle expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I wonder if the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, needs me to go further.

Whether that is true of the Government, I am still not entirely clear. The Minister has explained that.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para12"></a>What I am not clear about is why the Chancellor thought vertically at the time of the working tax credit. but now suddenly thinks horizontally. He might have considered that possibility in the first place. However, again I thank the Minister for her explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-22_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20516-22_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment, standing in my name and that of my noble friend, concerns the disabled person's tax credit. The noble Baroness has kindly provided a great deal of information behind the scenes on various aspects of the Bill. On Second Reading I expressed my concerns about the 16 hours requirement and entitlement to claim the working tax credit benefit. The noble Baroness very kindly sent one of the many letters she has written spelling out the matter.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para16"></a>However, concern has been expressed by outside bodies working with the disabled about that aspect. Of course we all wish to see the circumstances created where the disabled are facilitated in their desire to work and to benefit from them doing so. Perhaps the Minister might give the Committee a brief summary of the points set out in her letter, which I am sure will be of interest to outside bodies. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-22_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Amendment No. 8 seeks to delete the reference to disabled person's tax credit in Clause 1(3). Like working families' tax credit, the disabled person's tax credit was introduced in 1999, building on the foundations of the disability working allowance. So far as I recall, I believe that DWA had in the region of 16,000 claimants. The disabled person's tax credit now reaches over 32,000 claimants with an average award of &#163;77 a week.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para17"></a>The reason behind these proposals is to integrate disabled people into the labour market. We believe this will be welcome to them. Support for workers with disabilities will be provided through the working tax credit framework rather than through a tax credit that focuses on a disability. This may sound rather sentimental, but it is important that we talk about abilities rather than disabilities as far as possible. However, disabled people will have access to additional elements in WTC to provide them with appropriate levels of support.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para18"></a>Secondly, under the working tax credit, where there are two disabled workers in a couple, two disability elements will be payable and there will no longer be a lower withdrawal threshold for individual disabled workers. Another important improvement from which disabled people will benefit more than many is that <P>


<a name="column_CWH18"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they will no longer be hit by the capital rule when there has been a settlement by virtue of an injury, because only notional income will be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para19"></a>As I have said, the rates will go up. At the moment, a single disabled worker will have access to support of &#163;68 per week. From April 2003, they will have around &#163;5 more than under DPTC. The minimum income for such a worker on 35 hours a week will be &#163;194 a week, compared with &#163;172 this April. For someone working 16 hours, the minimum income rises to &#163;135 from &#163;127 now.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para20"></a>One further welcome advantage, which I hope will also be welcomed by Members of the Committee, is that proposals for childcare, in particular home childcare, should also be particularly beneficial to disabled people. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, welcomed that on Second Reading. He also asked about the 16-hours rule, as has the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, this afternoon. I reaffirm my response on Second Reading that there is no proposal to move from 16 hours being recognised as the appropriate demarcation of someone being in the labour market. At less than that, people tend to be supported through their benefits with disregards&#151;for example, a lone parent may be on income support and work up to a disregard of &#163;20 and only when she works 16 hours a week does she enter the territory of a work-supported benefit as opposed to an out-of-work supported benefit, as in the past.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para21"></a>The question is whether the 16 hours is about right. It is equivalent to about two days' full-time work. I also suggested to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that it was not particularly helpful to suggest that disabled people should have a lower number of hours before they could claim the new working tax credit. Instead, it seemed to me that the permitted work rules&#151;and, above all, the permitted supported work rules&#151;would be particularly beneficial to disabled people in that situation.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para22"></a>On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Rix talked about people with learning disabilities, who are likely to be in a supported work environment. Under the permitted work rule they can work and receive &#163;66 per week in addition to their benefit indefinitely. We think that those needs can be met in a more appropriate and focused way by keeping the 16-hour rule but allowing people below that on IB or SDA to have the &#163;66 per week for 26 weeks if they are in permitted work, and indefinitely if they are in permitted supported work, which is likely to be run by a voluntary organisation or a public body.
<P>

<a name="20516-22_para23"></a>I have taken rather more time to respond on this occasion, but it was important to put on the record that this may be a more appropriate and helpful way forward. With that, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<a name="20516-23_para2"></a><P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"increases in benefits in respect of children under sections 80 and 90 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c.4) and sections 80 and 90 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c.7)".

It is proposed by the Government that those benefits should be superseded and incorporated&#151;that is perhaps the most accurate way of putting it&#151;into the child tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para5"></a>Again, I have to ask the Minister whether that involves any specific change in the allowances, rather than just a change in terminology. We also have to consider the position with regard to child benefit, which the Prime Minister recently suggested&#151;the subject of some controversy&#151;might be reduced as some form of penalty. I sought to clarify the position on that by way of a Parliamentary Question. I asked the Minister to what extent any reduction in child benefit would result in the benefits which we are now discussing being increased, for example, so that the effect was totally nullified.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para6"></a>Perhaps the Minister could tell us in regard to the benefits which are dealt with in paragraph (e), or the new benefits which are dealt with under the new title of "child tax credit", whether, if the Government have decided that they ought to penalise people having child benefit for this or that social reason, it would in fact result in both the present benefit or the replacement benefit being increased so that the effect was largely nullified.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pressed me on two points. The first was on child benefits and sanctions, and the second was whether it was simply an alteration by name or whether there was any substantive change in the structure of CDIs.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para7"></a>On job benefit and sanctions, it is the case at the moment that if one is on income support or JSA, one's child benefit counts as income and therefore has an effect on the level of income support and JSA which one currently receives. Clearly, in any proposals to connect payment of child benefit with any sanctioning of behaviour, those arrangements could be adjusted accordingly. I hope that answers the noble Lord's question.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para8"></a>CDIs are the child dependency increases which go with current national insurance benefits like incapacity benefit, such that they receive those benefits almost as an alternative to being topped up by income support benefits for their children.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para9"></a>I burned the midnight oil on this about a year ago to get my head around its implications. Ultimately, it did not seem sensible to continue to keep child dependency <P>


<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increases for those social security benefits of which the major one is incapacity benefit, for two main reasons. The first, and the main one, is that if we are trying to simplify the system so that all child support is based on one benefit&#151;child tax credit&#151;it is foolish to have some other benefit like incapacity benefit retaining its own provision for children. Therefore, in the name of simplicity, it is right to take that out.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para10"></a>Secondly, it is also the case that over the last few years the level of CDIs have effectively been frozen because of the growth in child benefit, which has offset them. In any case they were diminishing in value. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that at the moment, there are around 250,000 families in receipt of one of those child dependency increases. They will be protected. What we are saying is that, in future, new claimants to that benefit will have their support for children carried through the new tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para11"></a>I hope that noble Lords are reassured that the existing CDIs will begin to wither on the vine; that in any case and for the sake of simplicity we believe that all child support should be carried with the children's tax credit, but that existing recipients of those CDIs will have their position protected. I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   That certainly was an interesting reply in two respects. What the Minister describes as CDIs, which I presume are the benefits covered by subsection (e), will continue for existing beneficiaries, but new beneficiaries will come under the child tax credit system. I hope that I have understood that correctly.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para12"></a>I am not entirely clear whether that means any of those beneficiaries will now receive less than they would otherwise have received. Clearly the people&#151;I was going to say "grandfather", which would really confuse the issue&#151;who are already in receipt of the benefits covered by subsection (e) will continue to do so and will not lose out. However, I am not entirely clear whether new claimants who would have received those benefits, and who will now receive child tax credit, will get the same amount as those who are already in receipt of it.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para13"></a>The other part of the answer from the noble Baroness was extremely interesting. The Prime Minister proposes that one should use a reduction in child benefit on families who are behaving in a manner of which he does not approve. I have pointed out&#151;the noble Baroness has confirmed it&#151;that that would not be effective because they would simply receive other benefits instead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I did not say that. I said that were the Government, after reviewing these proposals, to proceed with them, they would have the option of ensuring that, as a result, other benefits would not compensate. I say simply that that would be an option were Government to pursue those proposals.

<A NAME="20516-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   What the noble Baroness has said is that unless the proposal is to be totally ineffective, what they will do is not merely clobber child benefit, but other benefits as well. That is an aspect of the Prime Minister's proposal which perhaps had not previously emerged.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord could repeat that. I become nervous when the noble Lord starts attributing views to the Prime Minister via myself. I would be very grateful if he would say those words again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The Prime Minister made a proposal that, in certain circumstances, child benefit should be withdrawn from families because the family concerned was performing in a way which, for various reasons, he felt was wrong. The point I sought to make earlier was that apparently this would be ineffective. If he were to do that, then all that would happen would be&#151;this was confirmed by the noble Baroness's Parliamentary Answer&#151;that in effect such families would receive other benefits instead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I wonder whether&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps I may finish and then the noble Baroness can respond. That is what I understood her to say. The noble Baroness went on to point out that if that were to happen, then one might need to make adjustments to other benefits. Thus if this proposal were to go ahead, and apparently the Prime Minister is persisting with it, we would find either that it would not be effective&#151;because the other benefits would not be reduced&#151;or it would be made effective by clobbering not simply child benefit, but any other benefits which might replace it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That happens at the moment. It is a little hard for me to say that this is "wide of the Order Paper" when earlier we were talking about Keynes. However, child benefit will not be taken into account as income for child tax credit. The amount of child benefit as payment is therefore not in fact relevant to child tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para14"></a>Having said that, it remains the case that, at present, if one is on income support or JSA, child benefit is counted as income, which is therefore taken into account when determining the level of IS or JSA. We have established that. One of the highly desirable features of moving on to child tax credit is that we will not have such incidents of netting-off taking place as they did in the past. What I made clear is that, if on reflection the Government decide to go ahead with these proposals, then they would have the option of ensuring that they were effective by taking into account child benefit as income, and therefore not simply compensating for it with an uplift in other forms of benefit. That should not surprise the noble Lord. Were these proposals to be pursued, I do not doubt that this would be one of the considerations informing further reflection.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="20516-23_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: As this is the first time I have spoken, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the declaration of interest that I made at Second Reading. I thank the Minister for her gracious apology at the start of our proceedings today and for her entire attitude towards the problems that arose as a result of what she described.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para21"></a>So far as we are concerned, the Bill has a fine, worthy aim&#151;that is, to help to boost the income of people in low paid jobs&#151;and we support that. I hope that it will be recalled later that the amendments moved by my noble friends Lord Higgins and Lord Northesk and myself, and all the amendments moved from our Benches, were brought forward in a spirit of our working to assist the Government to make the Bill as effective and as workable as possible.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para22"></a>Having said that, Amendment No. 12 relates to the wider issue that we discussed earlier and to which we will return at several stages during the Committee stage of the Bill&#151;that is, the question of whether tax credits will be paid to people who do not pay tax. The Minister will recall my second question in a letter I wrote to her on 23rd April. I asked how much of the total cost of the Bill will be paid to those who do not pay tax&#151;that is, those who will be receiving credits as benefit? Unfortunately, although I have received a reply from the Minister, that point was not dealt with. I should be grateful if she can say what is the answer to that question.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para23"></a>The question seeks figures&#151;how much of the total cost of the Bill will be paid to those who do not pay tax&#151;and in order to answer it the Minister will have to say what is the total cost to the Exchequer of all tax credits; what will be the cost of these particular tax credits; and, of those amounts, how much will be paid to people who do not pay tax&#151;that is, to people who receive credits as benefit.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para24"></a>Having said that, and given that the reply to my letter did not deal with that point, perhaps I may pursue the amendment, the purpose of which is to suggest that where an individual is paying tax the Inland Revenue should deal with that person via the tax credit procedure set out in the Bill; but where an individual is a non-taxpayer, he or she should deal with the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="20516-23_para25"></a>Having brought forward the amendment, I can immediately see many problems with it. But it does touch on a central aspect of the Bill&#151;my noble friend Lord Higgins has referred to it and we will certainly be returning to it&#151;that is, the question of tax credits being paid to people who do not pay tax. I should be <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20516-23_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   There is a certain logic in what the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi says, in that when somebody receives tax credit, it should be dealt with by the Inland Revenue and when he receives a benefit, it is not. He possibly underestimates the extent to which people are not, for long periods, in one category or another. During the course of the year, many people will be in work for some of the time and out of work for other periods. My own experience of dealing with the Inland Revenue is that it is difficult enough to establish an understanding of one set of rules and one department. For people on low incomes&#151;shuttling in and out of work, sometimes having jobs for very short periods and then, for family or other reasons, not being able to continue with them&#151;there may be an accurate question as to whether the Inland Revenue is the right department, but it must make sense for one department to be responsible for a particular benefit rather than two.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I entirely share that view. The noble Lord has essentially returned to the points made by his noble friend about the nature of tax credits and whether it is right for them to be the vehicle for providing support to those outside the traditional tax system. The noble Lord is absolutely right that there is considerable mobility between those in and out of work, particularly for the families who are going to be enjoying this support. We are talking about people who are probably in the next to bottom quintile of the income range&#151;those in the bottom quintile are likely to be on benefit. These are people whose work is precarious, who very often find their hours reduced, who may well find themselves made redundant and whose partner may or may not be able to go to work as a result. They are families who move in and out of work and need to deal as far as possible with one system. It will be handled by the Inland Revenue. Clearly, anyone who is currently on IS or JSA will be able to get access to this information through Job Centre Plus, so an integrated service is being provided.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para0"></a>The proposition lying behind the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, would bifurcate&#151;cut right through the middle of&#151;our overriding aim of integrating out-of-work and in-work support and thus dealing with both family poverty and the move into the labour market.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para1"></a>Clause 2(1) brings tax credits under the care and management of the board. This means that the board will be able to appoint people to administer tax credits and will be responsible for accounting for them. It derives from the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. The concept of care and management cannot be applied to the Department for Work and Pensions <P>


<a name="column_CWH24"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because it does not have a parliamentary remit, so the amendment is technically flawed, although that should not perturb us particularly, as it is a probing amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para2"></a>The more fundamental point is that the amendment would cut across our aim of achieving a single framework of support. The majority of those who will be eligible for tax credits will already be customers of the Inland Revenue, because they receive WFTC, DPC, DPTC or children's tax credit or are taxpayers. They are already relating to the Inland Revenue as they receive this through their wage packets. In the new system, the same framework will also apply to families with children in which the adults are out of work or do not currently qualify for income-based support. Those are the key features of the new system, which seems to have been widely welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para3"></a>I could go into technical detail about the board and so on, but we are going back to the bigger issue behind the Bill: whether we should try to separate out support for those in work and support for those not in work, with one being dealt with by the Inland Revenue and the other by DWP. The whole point of the Bill is to bridge that divide, which can impede people trying to make rather a risky journey from being out of work to being in work. I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will not seek to pursue his amendment. I am happy to try to give him more technical information about the specific responsibilities of the Board of Inland Revenue, but he was probably after the bigger point.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para4"></a>The noble Lord also raised a point about numbers. I am sorry if I did not reply as fully as he would have liked to his letter. In a sense, I thought that I had given some of the statistics to his noble friend. About 10 to 11 per cent of the money going on the new tax credits will score as negative tax. I gave those figures on an earlier amendment. The rest of it will therefore be scored as public expenditure, out of a total cost of nearly &#163;15 billion for CTC and WTC put together. I thought that I had answered that point in my reply earlier when I suggested that we bank those statistics, but if I am able to help the noble Lord any further, I shall certainly do my best.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   As much as anything else, I was seeking information with this amendment and I am grateful to the Minister for what she has said. Did I correctly hear her say that the total cost of tax credits was &#163;15 billion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The total cost of family support through the CTC and WTC together is nearly &#163;15 billion. The additional support over and beyond the current system is about &#163;2.7 billion.

<a name="20516-24_para6"></a><P>

<a name="20516-24_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 14. I understand very well the issue of pre-emption that has just been explained. Amendment No. 13 would delete the whole subsection. The argument is to some extent focused by the reference to "gross" in Amendment No. 14.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para8"></a>We are somewhat puzzled by this provision, which seems to us to be potentially open to dispute. It suggests that the section of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, which refers to gross revenues being paid into the Exchequer, is suddenly, after a century and a half,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be construed as allowing the Board to deduct payments for or in respect of tax credits before causing the gross revenues of their department to be paid to the account mentioned in that section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-24_para9"></a>
The Act seems to have survived pretty well without this provision for 150 years or so. If I understand it correctly, it enables the Treasury to pay into the Exchequer less than the amount that it would pay under the provisions of the 1866 Act. I am particularly puzzled by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>""before causing the gross revenues of their department to be paid".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-24_para10"></a>
I would have thought that, if you deduct payments for and in respect of tax credits, the amount you are paying in is not the gross amount but the net amount. I simply do not understand why the term "gross amount" is used in this context. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Is that provision of the Bill simply the reverse of what was normal practice in the Exchequer before 1640? It had both advantages and disadvantages, but usually the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I was promptly provided with a page or two of the 1866 Act to see whether the noble Lord and I would have a debate about how we construed it, but we would certainly have to ask the noble Earl, Lord Russell, to umpire.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para11"></a>I believe it is fairly straightforward. Amendment No. 14 would change the reference to accounting for gross revenues under Section 10 of the 1866 Act to a reference to "net revenues". It is simply drafting. The reference to "gross revenues" is necessary to bring tax credits into the ambit of that legislation, under which the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise account for the money they have collected. We cannot refer back to the Act of 1866. While it is true to say that the receipts paid to the Exchequer by the board will be net of tax credits&#151;that being the point of subsection (2). The use of the term "gross revenues" is a drafting device to ensure that the cross-reference to Section 10 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 works. A reference to net revenues would be meaningless in this context because there is no such <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reference in Section 10 of the 1866 Act to which a drafting device could link. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   While we have the greatest respect for the draftsmen&#151;qualified a little on our earlier proceedings&#151;I see the point made by the noble Baroness. Having said that, however, surely it would be possible to devise some other form of words which would amend the 1866 Act. Perhaps it would be better to amend it rather than simply to say it should be construed. It could be amended in a way which would enable the board to deduct the payments for the tax credits. However, if the tax credits are to be deducted, then the amount which will be paid in is a net amount and not a gross amount.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para12"></a>I take the point on drafting made by the noble Baroness, but I say simply that it is not an accurate way of drafting this. The 1866 Act should be amended rather than construed. Then the amount that will be paid in will be a net amount and not a gross amount. I can see that there may be some problem because it may be that other departments are paying in gross amounts, but the reality is that this department will not be paying in a gross amount. It will be paying a net amount after the deduction of the tax credit, as is made perfectly clear in the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-24_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   If the noble Lord is making a point about the drafting, I am sure he is correct and I would be happy to follow up the point by writing to him about the implications of seeking to do as he suggests; that is, retrospectively to amend or consolidate&#151;I do not know what would be required here&#151;the wording in the 1866 Act.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para13"></a>However, a different point can be made here which concerns whether people know what is happening by the use of this phraseology, as opposed to why it is being deployed. That point concerns transparency and accountability to Parliament. I believe that Clause 2(5) should address any of the noble Lord's concerns on that. It requires the Inland Revenue to set out accounts for tax credits, distinguishing the amounts for each tax credit. That is a more rigorous procedure than that undertaken in respect of voted money.
<P>

<a name="20516-24_para14"></a>I can develop that argument but, if the noble Lord is concerned that we are concealing what is happening, then that is not true. If he acknowledges, however, that we need this as a drafting device but wonders whether there is some other way of approaching it, I would be perfectly happy to follow that up in writing.

<a name="20516-25_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20516-25_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a somewhat related point. The subsection states:

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-25_para5"></a>
Tax credits are quite clearly not revenue. Tax credits are paid out as benefits in 90 per cent of cases, as the noble Baroness has told us. In the remaining 10 per cent of cases they are simply a deduction from tax and thus no tax will be received as a result. Whatever else may be the case, it cannot conceivably be construed as inland revenue. This ought to state that tax credits will be excluded. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Like WFTC and DPTC, the working tax credit and child tax credit are to be administered by the Inland Revenue as part of the tax system, and will therefore fall within the overall administrative responsibilities of the board of Inland Revenue. Those responsibilities are generally set out in statute, and Clause 2 ensures that the new tax credits are covered by the relevant legislation. The effect of Clause 2 is substantially the same as that of Section 5 of the Tax Credits Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20516-25_para6"></a>The board's powers and responsibilities are derived, in the first instance, from the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins said. All of those powers and responsibilities relate to "inland revenue". The provision in Clause 2(3) is therefore necessary to ensure that the 1890 Act also extends to the board's tax credit responsibilities. The effect of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord would be to prevent the board administering tax credits since they would remain outside the scope of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act. The usual statutory framework under which the board operates would not apply to tax credit; for example, the power to appoint staff or responsibility to keep accounts.
<P>

<a name="20516-25_para7"></a>Given that, we have been debating at length the question of whether tax credits are properly to be treated as tax forgone and how they should be accounted for, but this amendment would prevent the board administering child tax credit and working tax credit at all, whether or not for those who have tax to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>pay. It would be far-reaching and damaging in its consequences and I hope with those remarks the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   If I understand the noble Baroness correctly, I have a very simple question. Why does the expression "inland revenue" not have capital letters?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Pass, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Is this a case for my favourite quotation from John Locke? "Printers have ways all their own, not united by the general plan which should cement mankind."

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Whether it is printers or whether it is anything to do with what happened within parliamentary reference I do not know, but I shall come back to the noble Lord on that. I do not know the answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I was not making a facile point, though it may have sounded that way. If I understand her original answer correctly, the noble Baroness is saying that it is a definition of the department which enables the department to administer the tax credits. That is not at all what appears on the face of the Bill. Clause 2(3) appears to relate to what is defined as "inland revenue". If it means the Department of Inland Revenue, it ought to say so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It is not a printer's mistake. I have now been given some guidance on this. The reason "inland revenue" is not in capital letters is that it is not a reference to the department, it is a reference to what the department does. In other words, the powers are exercised under the 1890 Act in connection with "inland revenue" which, for the purposes of the Act is defined in Section 39 of that Act as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the revenue of the United Kingdom collected or imposed as stamp duties, taxes . . . and placed under the care and management of the commissioners and any part thereof".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-25_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20516-25_para9"></a>In other words, it is referring to the revenues rather than the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   In that case we have gone full circle, and the business about whether it meant the department and whether that meant they were unable to deal with the matter is a total red herring. We are now back to whether or not a tax credit is revenue, and a tax credit is not revenue. It is either expenditure or it is a tax deduction, but by no conceivable meaning of the word can it be revenue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I want to be helpful to the noble Lord, but I am not sure what he is concerned about. I know he disagrees about the difference between whether this is a tax credit or a benefit, given whether one is in work or out of work. I know he disagrees about whether the Department for Work and Pensions or the Inland Revenue as a result should administer it. But he seems to be seeking to retain a distinction of chimneys, thus putting wedges between those out of work from moving into work.

<a name="20516-25_para10"></a>However, it cannot be a point about scrutiny because we can pursue that through some of the remarks I made earlier about parliamentary scrutiny. It cannot be a point about the functions of the board in terms of its powers because without such powers the board cannot operate as regards tax credits in terms of appointing staff and checking accounts. Ultimately, I do not understand what it is the noble Lord is asking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   My noble friend is saying that this is not revenue but money paid out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is theological. The effect of the amendment would be that the usual statutory framework under which the board operated did not apply to tax credits and that the board's usual powers&#151;those I have already outlined; that is, to appoint staff and to keep accounts&#151;did not apply to tax credit. I am not sure that I can help the noble Lord any further on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   I suggest that the Committee adjourn for the Division?
<P>

<a name="20516-25_para11"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.51 to 6.3 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was pressing me on what "inland revenue" means. The imprecise answer is that it means whatever we care to assume it means for these purposes. Perhaps I may give him a more precise description. In the 1890 Act, "inland revenue" is a reference to the scope of the board's activities. Even then, in the 1890s, the Board of the Inland Revenue would have had to dispense payments as well as bring in revenues&#151;for example, for the War Department and so on&#151;if Churchill was to have fun in the Boer War.
<P>

<a name="20516-25_para12"></a>In order to apply the statutory framework under which the board operates, we use the term "inland revenue" to cover all the board's responsibilities. It will also be extended to include child benefit under Clause 49. The board's powers and responsibilities are derived from the 1890 Act. We therefore need to ensure that it also applies to tax credits, and this provision applies it. In other words, this is a device for expenditure and income and not only the acquisition of income, if I may put it in those terms.
<P>

<a name="20516-25_para13"></a>Child benefit, statutory maternity payments and the like are clearly patterns of expenditure but come within the framework or the phrase "inland revenue". I do not know whether that helps the noble lord and it is why I have been baffled. It is rather like a trading account and the term "inland revenue" is used to cover both aspects of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-25_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful for that reply. I referred yesterday to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh when in another context I mentioned the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland saying,

<FONT SIZE=3>Red Queen. In essence, what the noble Baroness could say&#151;I would not dream of calling her Humpty Dumpty, although conceivably I could call her the Red Queen&#151;is that the expression in the subsection means what it means and what the Treasury says it means, but I am not prepared to go along with that. It would be best to sort this out between now and Report stage because it would be singularly tedious not to have it resolved before Report. However, it may be that the draftsman will produce another 35 pages which will make the matter clear. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 24, at end insert "and the amounts deducted by them from inland revenue"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-26_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20516-26_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a related amendment and seeks to clarify the position. Earlier the noble Baroness referred me to Clause 5 in order to reassure us with regard to subsection (2). In fact, we say here that, in expressing,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the amounts of the several payments made by them of or in respect of tax credits",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-26_para2"></a>
we suggest that they should also include the amounts deducted by them from inland revenue. That may be an appropriate way of ensuring that the report to the board is comprehensive. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   These amendments relate to the accounting requirements on the Board of Inland Revenue in relation to tax credits. Subsection (5) requires the board to show how much it has paid out by way of child and working tax credit, its administrative costs in respect of those credits and how much it has received by way of tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para3"></a>Amendment No. 16 continues the theme of Amendment No. 15, which we have just been discussing. If we do not know whether it comes from the Red Queen or Humpty Dumpty, always trust my noble friend Lord McIntosh. He knows more quotations and their sources than anyone else&#151;from fictive sources as opposed to non-fictive sources; I make that distinction. The amendment would prevent tax credits from falling within the definition of "inland revenue" for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. Consistent with that, the amendment of Lord Higgins seeks to make payments of tax credits be accounted for as deductions from inland revenue. Since, however, for the reasons we have just explored, it is necessary for tax credits to fall within the definition of "inland revenue" for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act, the board will not have made any deductions from inland revenue for which it needs to account.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para4"></a>Amendment No. 19 probes the requirement for the board to account for tax credits it has received. This may look odd at first sight, but it is aimed at requiring the board to account separately for recoveries of overpaid tax credit, as it does for recoveries of tax underpaid. The idea is that amounts of tax credit recovered paid out and amounts recovered should be <P>


<a name="column_CWH31"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accounted for separately in the interests of transparency. In light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will warm to the provision.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para5"></a>Amendment No. 16 makes a point which we have covered in some detail on other amendments. It is not an amendment that could have any substantive effect and therefore I urge noble Lords to resist it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   At least the recovery of overpayments might conceivably be regarded as inland revenue, having previously been expenditure for which they did not account. I do not want to persist with this. It is related to the earlier amendment and perhaps, if the noble Baroness is writing to me, she could refer to this as well. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Saatchi </B>   moved Amendment No. 17:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 25, after "expenses" insert "of the Board"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-26_para7"></a><P>

<a name="20516-26_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 17, standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Higgins, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 18. The Government propose to impose on employers, regardless of their size or profitability, the whole burden of administering the tax credit scheme. I believe that large companies have the machinery and the people to handle this very well and can generally look after themselves. So my remarks are directed at employers who may be small or very small businesses, sometimes just one person.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para9"></a>Smaller employers do not have and cannot afford the substantial departments to administer this scheme. That is why our Benches in this Chamber and, I believe, the Liberal Democrat Benches also on previous occasions, have attempted to mitigate these burdens or to seek compensation for them from the Treasury in one form or another. There have also been many attempts during the passage of the Bill in another place to attempt to reduce, mitigate or seek compensation for these burdens but the Government have remained unmoved. Therefore, we have given up on the notion that the Government might consider help for small businesses in these matters and, instead, we propose what I hope the Minister will agree is a very modest amendment indeed.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para10"></a>The amendment seeks only to require the Treasury, at the very minimum, to assess and to record the estimates of the amount of the cost to employers or, if the Minister prefers, the cost to small employers, of carrying out the new tasks which the Bill will require of them. Why do we ask for this? Because we believe that such a responsibility being placed on the Treasury will have the healthy effect of focusing the Treasury's attention on the issue of the cost of the Bill to small businesses.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para11"></a>It is not only our Benches which have raised this point. During the investigation of the new child tax credit by the Social Security Select Committee in another place, similar concerns were expressed. It was said there that businesses should not be treated as a social welfare arm of the Government, and speakers <P>


<a name="column_CWH32"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pointed to the risk of invasion of employee privacy and also to the risk of distraction from the wealth-creating activity of those small companies.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para12"></a>I believe it is also true that the Government's own Better Regulation Task Force recognised the regulatory burdens associated with the predecessor, working families' tax credit. In that case, in a report on payroll burdens, they said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"businesses now see themselves becoming unpaid benefit offices".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-26_para13"></a>
That report noted the particular burden for small firms, which is what I am stressing here, as a result of the working families' tax credit. I believe that that task force calculated that of the &#163;105 million of recurring costs for all businesses on the WFTC, &#163;25 million would fall on companies with just one to four employees.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para14"></a>Most of the local businesses I know employ that number of people, yet those businesses represent the bulk of employment in the economy and are the true engine of its growth. Any government which wants that growth to continue should want those companies to employ more people. Yet there are fears that the Bill, as it stands, could act as a disincentive to employing people because it invites extra cost and red tape for doing so.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para15"></a>Members of the Committee will forgive me if I say that, if we put unacceptable burdens on the businesses that support those people, we risk destroying the mechanism that creates those jobs. Those jobs lie at the heart of any government's ability to generate wealth which is where the resources for all our public good come from.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para16"></a>This is not a matter of great principle between the Opposition Benches and the Government but it is a matter of balance. Therefore I look forward to hearing that the Minister takes the point.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para17"></a>The contrary view would be that the Government can see the very great charm from the Treasury's point of view of making employers free suppliers to the benefit system. The problem is that the fine and worthy aim of the Bill, to which I referred earlier, of helping people move from welfare to work, will not be achieved precisely because of the burden that the Bill places on business. For example, a report entitled Work in Progress on the working families' tax credit from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux found that employers have sacked workers entitled to a pay boost, or cut their hours, because they want to avoid the red tape of paying WFTC through the wage packet. Apparently this report was based on more than 700 cases involving people affected by that new tax credit. The study cited an example of a lone mother with three children who lost her job when the tax credit was put in her pay.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para18"></a>According to those who are familiar with the situation in small companies, some people have found that receiving the tax credit from their employer is not worth the trouble it can sometimes cause. Some employers apparently consider the administrative burden to be too great for them to manage and, in a small number of cases, people have been sacked merely for claiming tax credits. We may think that that is <P>


<a name="column_CWH33"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>monstrous, but it is an illustration of the pressures that small businesses are sometimes under. Other staff have put pressure on employers to reduce their hours so that they do not qualify for these credits and avoid being threatened with dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para19"></a>The House had previously voted by 161 to 121 for a Liberal Democrat amendment to allow small employers to opt out of the system. On that occasion, it was decided not to risk a confrontation with another place by insisting on two amendments on which this House had defeated the Government. During that debate&#151;although I was not present&#151;I believe that the Minister urged this House to accept the decision of another place to reject the amendments. One of those amendments would have allowed employers with fewer than 10 employees to be exempted from paying the tax credit to their employees, payment being made instead by the Inland Revenue itself. On that occasion, the Minister said that that amendment would strike at the heart of the tax credit policy and was therefore unnecessary and inappropriate.
In response, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;while agreeing that this was not an appropriate issue on which to force a battle between the two Houses&#151;made clear that he had called for an "opt-out" and not an exclusion. The noble Lord said that it would have prevented small employers having to fund the cost of administering the new system.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para20"></a>I have spoken at length because our Benches certainly have given up the hope of persuading the Government to compensate or find ways of dealing with this issue other than by requiring small companies to do the work for them. I do not know what is the view of the noble Earl, Lord Russell. We shall hear that in a moment.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para21"></a>I hope that the Minister will at least accept this very modest amendment, which, after all, seeks only the publication of regular information about the scale of the burden that is being placed on business so that people can focus on it as an aspect of the working of the Bill. I beg to move.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-26_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is right. We on these Benches feel a considerable sympathy with this amendment. My honourable friend, Mr Webb, in the debate in another place, attempted to achieve the same end by the much more far reaching device of giving up the method of paying through the pay packet. There is a whole range of issues here in which&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, rightly said&#151;there is a problem of balance.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para22"></a>When you are dealing with a small business which employs, perhaps, three or four people, and it has to take on an extra person simply to understand the paperwork, which is quite complicated, that may make a real change to the finances of the business and possibly even threaten its viability. We do not want to diminish the number of small businesses in this country because they are one of the vital parts of the economy and one of the sectors which are capable of growth. The Exchequer will be as much a loser as the small businesses if we do not get this right.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH34"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para23"></a>Though I have sympathy with the small business, I have also perhaps even more sympathy for those who are dismissed by businesses&#151;some of them businesses which, if I may so put it, are big enough to know better&#151;for either claiming working families' tax credit or still claiming statutory sick pay (cases of that are still coming in 12 years after the Bill went through), or, in spite of the fact that it is illegal, for pregnancy. The fact that dismissal for pregnancy is illegal seems to have done surprisingly little to deter employers from continuing to do it. One wonders whether either the enforcement is sufficiently rigorous or the penalties of sufficient size to act as a necessary deterrent.
<P>

<a name="20516-26_para24"></a>Talking of employers who are big enough to know better, the last case of this sort that came to my attention was a threat of dismissal to somebody short of 12 months' service for taking one day off work with a slipped disc. I do not think that sort of thing is in employers' interests any more than it is in employees' interests. Labour is one of the raw materials of business. One would not treat one's other raw materials with that degree of indifference. If one does, it costs. Maybe the Minister will look again at my honourable friend Mr Webb's suggestion for moving away from the pay packet as the vehicle of delivery. They have gone a little way in that direction; possibly there is a little further that they could go. Possibly also before Report stage of the Employment Bill, the Minister might have a quiet word, of which I shall not need to know anything, with her noble friend Lord Sainsbury or Turville.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am pondering the implications of that last remark. I do not think it is what is needed, but I shall perhaps have a conversation.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para0"></a>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 together are aimed at bringing forward the issue of the compliance costs to employers of paying tax credits with wages. They insert a reference to the expenses of the board alongside the proposition that the board's accounts should include an estimate of the cost of tax credits to employers.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para1"></a>Members of the Committee opposite would like to impose a requirement to have the board's accounts reflect an estimate of employers' costs of administering tax credits. It would, of course, not be right to require the board to account for costs other than their own. The proper place to address employers' costs will be in the revised Regulatory Impact Assessment which is being prepared in the light of announcements made in the Budget.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para2"></a>I am sure that we will have considerable debate on the issue when we reach Clause 24 of the Bill, which I shall not seek to anticipate, except to remind Members of the Committee that savings of &#163;11 million a year are expected from the changes to the system for employers, and that those changes have been welcomed by employer groups.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para3"></a>To confirm that point, consultation has shown that organisations have supported the move to streamline the system of payment via the employer. Admittedly, we quote from the CBI, which tends to represent the major employers, but the CBI states that its members:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"support and welcome the attempts made by the government to simplify the rules for tax credits. In particular...abolition of the need for employers to provide a proof of earning certificate&#151;which should considerably reduce the number of routine administrative enquiries employers receive, simplification of the notice periods...providing automatic funding for employers who are already in receipt of advanced funding",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-27_para4"></a>
and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"support the principle of moving from a fixed 6-month payment of tax credits to a rolling 12-month period".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-27_para5"></a><P>

<a name="20516-27_para6"></a>I could quote from the Institute of Payroll and Pensions Management or from the Association of Convenience Stores, the Institute of Directors and other organisations. Clearly, all businesses would prefer not to be paying out student grants or being responsible for the introduction of orders on child maintenance and the like. Having said that, the changes the Bill introduces over the existing tax credit system, with its accompanying savings of &#163;11 million and its simplification and streamlining of procedures, have been warmly welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para7"></a>It does mean, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, suggested, that this is in part due to the fact that the child tax credit will be paid to the main carer and employers will now only be responsible for that element which is paid to the adult, the working tax credit, and therefore that too simplifies the situation.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para8"></a>A couple of specific quotes have been made by the previous speakers. The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, echoed the NACAB point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, on Second Reading relating to improper or illegal behaviour by employers, given the use of tax credits to try to reduce people's hours, or even to dismiss them.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para9"></a>I said on Second Reading that such behaviour was illegal and could be pursued through the courts. I had only some very slight anecdotal evidence from NACAB, and certainly when I have been asked about it I have had no consistent evidence of this happening. However, once a person is an employee, he or she is protected against detriment or dismissal by the provisions in Schedule 3 to the Tax Credits Act 1999. Similar protection will be provided by Schedule 1 to the present Bill. I am happy to put that into Hansard so that NACAB in particular knows to which section of the Bill they can return.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I know very well that the protection exists, and I am grateful for it. The question on which I hope the Minister might have a quiet word with her noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Turville is how that protection might be made more effective, because it is certainly not sufficiently effective at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Obviously any case is a bad case in that sense, but I am in a dilemma because I have seen no serious evidence that this is a sustained <P>


<a name="column_CWH36"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem. I am not in any sense suggesting that the examples are not well-founded. However, I do not know how serious a problem this is. The point has never been made to me as I have gone round talking to groups of lone parent advisers for example. That it happens, on occasion, I do not doubt, but how serious or sustained a problem it is, I do not know.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para10"></a>All I can do at this stage is try to help make clear the legal rights and legal dependencies of employees in the situation. We should not reward bad employers by seeking to change the structure of the Bill, which in my view is so beneficial to everyone else. That would be absurd. It is like saying that if a man threatens violence you do not make him pay child support, and you reward violent behaviour. You cannot do that.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para11"></a>However, if I can help by making clear any of the legal provisions that protect employees in this situation, and indeed follow that discussion with Lord Sainsbury, as the noble Earl suggested, to see whether he has any DTI evidence of this happening, I am, of course, very happy to do so, because any case is a bad case.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para12"></a>The second point I wanted to raise was the distinction between small employers and larger employers. There are two points there. First, there is an assumption that somehow a cap in hand process is very difficult, and that we should therefore lift this burden off the shoulders of small employers. I do not accept that description of the situation facing them. Whatever the size of their company, all they have to do is to pay out what the tax credit office tells them to pay. They do not have to do any of the calculations themselves. If they need funds, and the funds that they are holding for national insurance are not sufficient to meet their bills, the Inland Revenue will provide those funds.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para13"></a>The arrangement in place with the Inland Revenue is as near to being automatic as one can get it. That has been recognised by employing companies.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para14"></a>On a more philosophical point, I am not comfortable about trying to draw lines between small and medium-sized companies&#151;those of up to 15 or 20 employees, or whatever the noble Lord has in mind&#151;and larger ones. That was the argument used to stop discrimination against disabled people. I am sure I will have the support of the noble Earl, Lord Russell here. Ever since the Conservative government passed the very important Disability Discrimination Act 1995, we have been seeking, with all-party consent, not to say that someone's right to disability protection depended on the size of the company that employed them.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para15"></a>In the same way here, we are concerned about making the move into work pay. It may not currently pay, because wage rates on entering work are often much lower than median wages. That problem is more likely to happen with smaller companies rather than large ones. It is therefore more important that the money is paid through the payroll for smaller companies than it is for greater ones.
<P>

<a name="20516-27_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, may not share our approach to this, and obviously businesses might well prefer not to be involved with this at all. However, it <P>


<a name="column_CWH37"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could not be a simple procedure. We must ensure not only that work pays, but that it is perceived to pay. The technical point is that it would be unreasonable to expect the board to account for costs other than its own. I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   Can the Minister say where the figure of &#163;11 million comes from for the savings of employers' costs?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The figure of &#163;11 million has been provided by the Inland Revenue and accepted by the organisation, based on some of the changes being made. I shall be happy to write to the noble Lord about the particular improvements of this scheme over the previous one which will allow him to assess whether he feels the figure of &#163;11 million is realistic.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I have listened with interest to what the Minister has said. I should declare an interest as an employer of a small business in the voluntary sector, which has grown from nothing to 35 to 40 people. During that time, many different evolutionary systems of tax credits have been introduced. They have been handled with great comfort and grace. Like any other small and, it is hoped, good employers, we see this is as very much part of being a good employer. In essence, these are support and benefit systems and tax credit systems which support a productive and effective workplace.

<a name="20516-27_para17"></a>We employ many young people with children and we have not found it difficult to do so. From my experience in the voluntary sector, I can say that I have heard no complaints from organisations of our size. I support the provision and the general philosophical point that has been made; namely, that this is very much concerned with developing a positive culture of good employer/employee relations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I welcome the support of my noble friend. If the argument of discrimination against particular employees and pressure on hours were to apply, it would be more likely to apply under the old working families' tax credit system that we currently have in place, because by definition it has tended to target lone parents. By applying the working tax credit to adults, irrespective of whether they have children, if the employer is seeking to discriminate then, if he is a low-paying employer, he is going to end up discriminating against his entire workforce.

<A NAME="20516-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Did I understand the Minister correctly to say that the Inland Revenue had carried out a calculation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I said that this figure was supplied to me and, I do not doubt, calculated by the Inland Revenue as a saving of &#163;11 million in costs over the current compliance costs for employers for <P>


<a name="column_CWH38"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the existing tax credit system. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, I shall be happy to write explaining how that figure was arrived at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am still puzzled about this. If the Inland Revenue is capable of making that calculation, it must be able to calculate the extra cost of administering the tax credit, deducting the beneficial savings of the workings of the new system, and therefore arriving at a net figure; that is, the figure of &#163;11 million. Is that right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Does the noble Lord mean for employers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Yes, for employers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The point I sought to make is that it is not the job of the Board of Inland Revenue to determine the costs for employers except in so far as it is calculated through the regulatory impact assessment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I understand that, which is why I am puzzled by the fact that the Inland Revenue has made this calculation. I think that the noble Baroness said that it was not for the Inland Revenue to make these calculations. The noble Baroness said that they were made for the regulatory impact assessment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It is not for the board to account for costs other than their own in terms of public statements. The RIA has been published with the Bill. When, as requested, the board publishes its reports and so forth, it is not for the board to account for costs other than their own. That is all I seek to make clear. That does not mean to say that we cannot estimate those; it is not for the board to account for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   If the Inland Revenue is capable of making this calculation of the saving, it means that it is capable of making the calculation and assessing whether there is a burden or&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It is not a question of capacity. It is a question of propriety.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Since the noble Baroness is relying on the Inland Revenue's calculations to dismiss the argument that there has been a burden placed on business, it is obviously reasonable to rely on the revenue's estimates to find out whether there has been a burden or a saving. The amendment seeks only to ensure that the revenue will repeat on an annual basis the exercise carried out to arrive at the figure of &#163;11 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The right place for the costs, as I sought to point out earlier, is in the regulatory impact assessment, not in the report of the board accounting for its own accounts. That is all.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para0"></a>The Committee will forgive me, but I suspect that again we may be considering angels on pinheads here. No one is suggesting that any attempt should be made to conceal or obfuscate the compliance costs for <P>


<a name="column_CWH39"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employers, although I hasten to emphasise that those compliance costs are substantially reduced and their reduction has been welcomed by employers. The question is: at what point and in what way and to whom does the board account for its activities? This is not the right format. It is almost as mechanical as that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am happy to leave it at that, though what we have witnessed here is a consistent pattern on the Government's part to be unwilling to accept that this Bill places burdens on small companies. We can swap reports and evidence and quotations from different bodies.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para1"></a>I hope that the Minister understands that, according to the research that one sees, one of the reasons why businesses have grown slightly disillusioned with the Government is this very problem of excess regulation and red tape. Therefore, in the interests of her own Government, the noble Baroness would do better to show more sympathy with small businesses than to dismiss their concerns with the use of the phrase, "All they have to do is to&#151;"

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I was simply going to challenge the noble Lord about the whole issue of the Government's attitude to small and medium-sized enterprises. I shall write to him because this is important&#151;rather than take up the time of the Committee now&#151;setting out everything that this Government have done to support and help small and medium-sized enterprises, including having a stable economy, having low inflation, reducing corporation tax, helping cash flow, boosting investment, encouraging innovation and research work, encouraging the use of IT and so forth. I shall happily write him a 15-page letter setting out what the Government are doing to support small and medium-sized enterprises. I cannot let that statement go.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para2"></a>I am saying that small businesses should not find this at all problematic. It is a simpler procedure than the one they currently operate&#151;and that is certainly simple. All they have to do is to pay out the figure from the Inland Revenue. As my noble friend said, this is part of ensuring that those businesses will be able to attract a wider labour force than might otherwise be the case. The wages that they would otherwise be paying, which are extremely low although they are the minimum wage, may not offer the best package into the labour market for people with children. They now have a wider labour force on which to draw because people with children can now afford to work as a result of the support for their children coming through the child tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para3"></a>That is the first point. My stats are out of date so I ask the Committee to forgive me if I am slightly inaccurate. When we last debated this issue of tax credits, I was able to point out to the noble Lord then that in the UK the non-wage labour costs represented an average of about 26 per cent ongoing costs to employers, compared with a figure in Europe which ranged between 40 and 50 per cent. I have seen nothing to suggest that that rough equivalent has changed. This country still has one of the best climates anywhere <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-28_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I am happy to leave the matter there. I am sure we shall want to return to this very important subject in other stages but, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME="20516-28_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Saatchi </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:

"( ) The treatment of the accounts kept by the Board shall conform to the standards established by the OECD."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20516-28_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: The background to this amendment can be found in box C2 on page 216 of the current Red Book. It is also dealt with in the exchange of correspondence that I have had with the Minister. The third point in my letter asked for confirmation that it was in fact the case that any money paid as a benefit&#151;in other words, not as a reduction in tax&#151;will be dealt with as public expenditure. This would represent a move to the OECD format for the public accounts. Box C2 deals with that, as does her reply to my letter, from which she quoted earlier. In her letter the Minister confirmed that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit will score in Treasury publications as negative tax ... to the extent that the credits are less than or equal to the tax liability of the family, with the remainder scored as public expenditure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-28_para8"></a>
The Minister said earlier that the latest estimates for the total value of tax credits was &#163;15 billion, of which about 10 per cent&#151;it states in her letter 10 to 11 per cent, but I shall stick with the round figure&#151;of the new tax credits will score as negative tax with 90 per cent scoring as public expenditure.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para9"></a>In order to explain why the amendment has been brought forward and has caused such difficulty I shall need to repeat a little history. I hope that the Committee will bear with me while I do so. The problem is that the Government have persisted for too long in a practice which many observers have described as "creative accounting". The background to this is that the UK adopted the 1995 European system of accounts, which is known as ESA/95, in September 1998. ESA/95 is an EU regulation that gives legal force to the internationally agreed 1993 system of national accounts, which is known as SNA/93. The UK had been required to make returns to Eurostat, which is the statistical office of the European Union, on an ESA/95 basis since April 1999. While the UK could have continued to publish national accounts data on that basis, it was decided by the ONS to adopt the ESA/95 for domestic as well as international purposes.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para10"></a>While the Treasury generally follows ONS practice in publications such as the Red Book, from which I have been quoting, and the pre-Budget report, there were points at which&#151;for reasons which are not clear and which I hope the Minister will explain; it would be comforting to know what were the reasons&#151;<P>


<a name="column_CWH41"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>differences occurred between the Treasury and the ONS on the treatment of, in particular, the working families' tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para11"></a>Many people believe&#151;I am sure that the Minister is aware of this&#151;that the Government defied international conventions under the European system of accounts, ESA/95, which had been adopted by the ONS. They defied the ruling by counting all of the working families' tax credit as negative income tax in their measure of the national tax burden. That was thought by many to be a breach of international accounting standards. People felt, but did not know, that as only a proportion of the working families' tax credit related to relieving an income tax liability, and the other part related to claims which could not conceivably be described as negative income tax because there was no income tax liability to be relieved, that treatment was inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para12"></a>I do not think that the critics then knew that the balance between those amounts, which one could describe as "illegitimate" as negative taxation, added up to 90 per cent of the total. Economists and others knew that there was a distinction, but I do not believe that anyone knew that the scale was as enormous as that. That is the background.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para13"></a>When people were looking forward to this Bill, those who were anxious about this point in terms of treatment thought they could see a situation in which large amounts of government expenditure were then being transferred to a tax net-off and other amounts were about to be transferred as a result of the Bill. People thought, though they did not know the scale, that by the time we reached the end of the Bill, there would be a very large sum indeed being dealt with in this way. The noble Baroness has confirmed today that it is a very large sum&#151;&#163;15 billion a year.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para14"></a>With a GDP of around &#163;1,000 billion a year, &#163;15 billion a year is 1.5 per cent of GDP. I believe the noble Baroness said earlier that the correct figure was &#163;15 billion. I think she also said that the correct proportion of that &#163;15 billion, which was to be treated as public expenditure rather than negative tax, was 90 per cent. What is puzzling&#151;I am sure I have misunderstood this, but I would be grateful to understand it better&#151;is that box C2 says that the change to treating the tax credits in line with OECD accounting principles adds about 0.5 percentage points to the tax GDP ratio for 1999-2000 onwards.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para15"></a>That does not seem to add up. If the figure is &#163;15 billion, which represents 1.5 per cent of GDP, and 90 per cent of it is what had previously been classified as tax reduction but is now being classified as public expenditure, that ought to make a difference of 1.5 per cent to the tax GDP ratio. I would be extremely interested to be better informed about what we must remember is probably one of the most important political statistics in Britain. General elections have certainly been won and lost on the basis of the figure that I am talking about.
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para16"></a>No doubt I am wrong, but I would like the noble Baroness to take the Committee through the calculation of the impact of the change described in <P>


<a name="column_CWH42"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>box C2 on the calculation of the so-called tax burden. I am very glad to see the Treasury Minister return, because I remember his admonishment that our Benches should not refer to something called the "tax burden" on the grounds that the word "burden" was offensive, as it sounded painful, and that the correct and preferred phrase was "net taxes and social security contributions as a percentage of gross domestic product".
<P>

<a name="20516-28_para17"></a>Taking the noble Lord's preferred wording, I wish to ask the noble Baroness to take the Committee through the previous treatment of tax credits, the new treatment that is proposed and the figures that go from one treatment to another. That is the purpose of the amendment. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020516/text/20516-29.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I do not know enough about such matters to comment on that, but the answer is almost certainly that it has not.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para0"></a>I suggest that the treatment that has existed in the Red Book for some time has not been consistent with OECD principles. The noble Baroness said today that the Government would move to bring the treatment in line with OECD principles, which we would very much welcome. The most important aspect about the treatment of these tax credits is that they are dealt with on a consistent basis from year to year so that readers of the public accounts can discover what is going on. So any change in accounting practices is a red light to readers of public accounts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps I may give the noble Lord an explanation. If I am obscure or ill-informed on any points, then I am sure that noble Lords will draw it to my attention.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para1"></a>On the first point about OECD guidance, this has only recently been finalised following a long period of consultation. The Government have therefore decided to follow best international practice.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para2"></a>Turning to the point about the 0.5 percentage point rise&#151;the discrepancy between that and the &#163;15 billion/90 per cent figure&#151;this is the tax GDP ratio for 1999-2000. In other words, this is about re-classifying retrospectively the existing WFTC system under the new rules, as opposed to what would happen when the new tax credits come into play.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   The phrase used is that this change adds about 0.5 percentage points to the tax GDP ratio for 1999-2000 onwards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, but these figures are in fact for April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   Is it possible for the Minister to write to me? What we would very much like to see is for the "before" and "after" treatment of tax credits to be <P>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spelt out, along with the "before" and "after" impact on the tax GDP ratio. I believe that many people outside this Chamber would like to see that as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   All we are doing is revising previously published figures to be consistent with the new OECD guidance. That is all. The figures apply to the existing system. However, of course the noble Lord knows that I like nothing better than sending him letters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   The amendment deals with how one treats a tax credit which is partly&#151;indeed largely&#151;a benefit, as we have discovered this afternoon. We have grappled, as the Government have, with what is the most intellectually and politically satisfactory way of dealing with this. I suspect that all Members of the Committee would agree that the ONS/OECD definition&#151;which the Government have now adopted&#151;that tax credits are treated as tax credits and benefits as public expenditure, is the logical way forward. It allows us to see clearly where the balance lies between the two parts of these credits/benefits.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para3"></a>Where the Government have been criticised&#151;and retain a residue of criticism&#151;is over the long time it has taken to reach this point. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, when he described the previous system of accounting as creative accounting. The main purpose&#151;at a time when the Government were seeking desperately to prove that they wore an even thicker hair shirt than their predecessor&#151;undoubtedly was to show that the tax burden, or tax rate, or level of taxation in the economy was low, and therefore the economy was safe in Labour's hands.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para4"></a>One of the methods it used was this classification of the working families' tax credit in a way that was misleading&#151;to the extent that no one could understand the figures at all. Therefore, on this side of the Chamber we welcome the fact that we have now reached a point at which it will be absolutely clear where the balance of benefit and credit falls.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para5"></a>As Members of the Committee will know, I say those words as a member of a party which has not shied away from accepting levels of taxation which may be higher in order to achieve certain public policy goods. From the start we would not have found it difficult to accept that a slightly higher level of taxation was needed in order to deliver what the Government and other Members of the Committee would consider good, sensible benefits in many other respects.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para6"></a>Having adopted the OECD guidelines and recommendations, I have sympathy with the amendment. We only hope that the Government now stick to them and, two years down the track, when other things may be happening to make life difficult for them, they do not seek to reclassify them and go back to their previous unsatisfactory practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   Perhaps the Minister could help the Committee. I refer to a point that I raised earlier. As I recall, the Minister said that the portion of total tax <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>credits we are talking about which effectively reduced the taxation of a household to nil would be treated as a tax repayment and the balance&#151;approximately 89 to 90 per cent&#151;would be regarded as public expenditure. That apportionment, incidentally, creates real administrative problems and the much simpler solution of my noble friends Lord Higgins and Lord Saatchi, of treating it all as public expenditure, would not create this simple problem; namely, that the apportionment must be an estimate.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para7"></a>The Minister may have received advice earlier on this. If the calculation is to be made on the basis of P60s, it would be consistent with having the figures on public expenditure&#151;and a 1 per cent variance is &#163;150 million. The Minister talks about 10 to 11 per cent which is a difference of &#163;150 million; a significant sum. If we rely on the employer's P60 calculation, it will reflect accurately as far as the employer is concerned where tax has been reduced to nil and therefore where the cut-off is. That is the only practical way forward that I can see. If we rely on the accurate figures, which is what the taxpayer returns&#151;that could be a year later&#151;we have first to calculate the household tax as opposed to the individual's tax. We will therefore have a timing difference. It is perhaps a technical point and the Minister may like to write to me if that is helpful. But will she accept that this apportionment is an estimate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Perhaps I might add a few more words. I agree with the points that have been made all round the Committee about the need for a consistent standard of counting. But I want to take up two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi. First, he said that the proportion of GDP going on public expenditure is perhaps the most important political figure there is; or words to that effect. That is confusing the shadow with the substance. The proportion of spending counted as public spending is not an objective question.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para8"></a>As this discussion illustrated, it is always a matter of classification. For example, when I first came into the House, health insurance added 400 dollars on to the price of every Chrysler car. That is not public expenditure but it was just as big a burden on the American economy as if it had been. When Mr Robin Cook paid a visit to Singapore shortly after this Government came into office, it was reported that Singapore's public expenditure was 18 per cent of GDP. It then emerged that if the Singapore Provident Fund was included, out of which all old age pensions were paid, the correct figure would have been 38 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para9"></a>This is a purely subjective question. Thus, a lot of expenditure is a burden on the economy regardless of whether it comes out of a pocket labelled "private" or a pocket labelled "public". That is too easily lost sight of on both sides of the discussion.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para10"></a>The other point I want to take up is the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, about the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, rebuking him for using the phrase, "tax burden". I remember when I first arrived in this House I said that I had never in my life protested about <P>


<a name="column_CWH45"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my level of taxation and was not going to do so now. I remember the faces of absolutely blank astonishment on the Benches opposite. What they seemed not to understand&#151;and I say this only in order to increase mutual understanding and not to change anybody's mind about anything&#151;is that I feel about this exactly the same sense of repugnance that many people on the Conservative Benches feel about criticising the policy of a British government in time of war. That is something which I am prepared to do. I know it serves in Conservative Benches a sense of utter repugnance, even if they may in private think the criticism justified. I just ask them to understand that similar feelings exist in other parties, though they may take a very different form. If that is understood it will ease communication between us.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_time0"></a><H5>7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Since I became a taxpayer 45 years ago it has always been my principle that Labour governments, which I think ought to have taxed me more heavily, have taken several years to get around to taxing more heavily, and Conservative governments, which I think ought to tax me more heavily, have done it immediately on coming to office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-29_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I will seek to be brief. I confirm what was said in the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi asked me about. He is correct that the new tax credits will be accounted for as negative taxation to the extent that they are less than or equal to the tax liabilities of the adults in the household. Otherwise it is public expenditure. That is consistent with the OECD guidance.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para11"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, asked me to confirm that this was an estimate. Yes, it is an estimate, but that should not be surprising. The split between tax and public spending is based on an estimate using FRS and FES survey data, and that will be revised upwards or downwards in the light of new evidence. This process has been held to be satisfactory for OECD purposes. Obviously, we will also use the same procedure to estimate the total cost of new tax credits and other tax and benefit changes. All the time in social security we are estimating how much we are going to put in for what used to be called unemployment benefit. It may not turn out to be that precise figure, but it is an estimate. I do not see why that should be surprising.
<P>

<a name="20516-29_para12"></a>Finally, I would like to reinforce the point made so eloquently by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and by my noble friend. The burden of taxation has been mentioned. I believe that tax credits are an investment in our children to help them overcome poverty, above all by making it financially viable for their parents to work. The noble Lord's burden is my investment. I suspect we have different readings of how society should be organised. I hope none the less that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any difficulty accepting the amendment if I did not withdraw it. It simply says what she has said at the Dispatch Box and in her letter. The aim is simply that the treatment of the accounts kept by the board shall conform to the standards established by the OECD. Having heard what the noble Baroness has said, we welcome her late conversion. Therefore, instead of my withdrawing the amendment, would the Minister consider accepting it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   If the amendment is redundant, why should we accept it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   If the amendment does nothing other than reassure people such as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that there may be some other change of heart, given the Government's past practices in this area, that would be reason enough to agree to it, so everyone would know where they stood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The amendment relates to the board's accounts. OECD treatment is a matter for Treasury figures. Obviously the Inland Revenue reports to the Treasury. I do not see the point. I would certainly resist putting additional words on the face of the Bill that do not add to the OECD accounting methods. As it stands, the amendment is redundant in terms of its policy thrust. In practice it would be flawed because the amendment relates to the board's account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   That is a pity. I am sure we will want to come back to this, perhaps later in Committee stage or on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-30_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20516-30_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 21. This is a rather technical amendment which suggests that the passage in parenthesis in Clause 2(6) should be deleted. It states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In any declaration for the purposes of section 6 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (c.9) (declarations on taking office), whether made before or after the commencement of this section, the reference to an offence relating to inland revenue is to be taken to include a reference to an offence relating to a tax credit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-30_para4"></a>
However, as I understand the parenthesis, it is suggested that that should apply whether this declaration is made before or after the commencement of this section.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para5"></a>I am not clear how that will operate in practice. Let us suppose that this section had not yet come into effect, how could it refer to a tax credit which did not exist, albeit that the expression "a tax credit" is rather ambiguous because we have about 39 different tax credits&#151;I have lost count of exactly how many&#151;some of which are being abolished and some of which are being introduced. Is this to include reference to all tax credits? In any case, how is it to be operated retrospectively? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am happy to explain the purpose of the provisions. Under the Taxes Management Act 1970, Inland Revenue staff and the Commissioners must make a formal declaration that they will not disclose any information received by them in the execution of their duties, except for the purposes of those duties, or in the prosecution of certain offences, or where disclosure is otherwise required by law.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para6"></a>This obligation of confidentiality will extend to information received in connection with tax credits. This clause accordingly amplifies the relevant provision in the Taxes Management Act. The general duty of non-disclosure, tempered by the fact that disclosure is permitted in certain circumstances in the Bill&#151;for example, prosecution of offences and so forth&#151;it does not place retrospective requirements on staff, although I understand why the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, might well think so.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para7"></a>The declaration taken by existing staff already imposes a general duty of non-disclosure in relation to the execution of their duties. These duties may, of course, change from time to time. Clause 2(6) relates to the scope for disclosure for the purposes of the prosecution of offences. All it does is to ensure that once the Tax Credits Bill takes effect, existing staff who deal with the new tax credits are subject to precisely the same confidentiality requirements as they already have in relation to tax matters.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para8"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that it would make little sense for existing staff who started to work on tax credits to be unable to disclose information for the purposes of prosecuting a tax credit offence where they could do so in the case of an offence relating to an income tax matter. This provision avoids that situation and ensures that, as with similar provision made in earlier legislation, Inland Revenue staff are under the same obligations of confidentiality in relation to all the information they may receive in the course of their work. I hope that the noble Lord will feel comfortable with that explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful for the explanation. I have suddenly realised that I probably proposed the original Section 6 in the Taxes Management Act 1970, which is slightly worrying. I believe that I understand the point made by the noble Baroness. I would like to look very carefully at precisely what she has said since she was clearly reading it out rather than making it up as she went along&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I always read it out&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   As a consequence I am sure that the words were prepared adequately by the revenue. One of the great virtues of the Minister is that she does not always read out her brief, and therefore sometimes we understand what has been said. In all events, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 2, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-30_para11"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SUBMISSION OF REPORT TO TREASURY BY BOARD
<br>
(1) The Board shall submit a monthly report to the Treasury giving an account of its care and management of tax credits.
<br>
(2) Among the matters the Board shall include in its monthly report are&#151;
<br>
(a) the Board's estimates of the total possible take-up of each tax credit, and the statistical and other assumptions upon which such estimates are made;
<br>
(b) the Board's estimates of the total practicable take-up of each tax credit, and the statistical and other assumptions upon which such estimates are made; and
<br>
(c) the actual take-up of each tax credit.
<br>
(3) The Treasury shall publish the monthly reports of the Board and, where the take-up of any tax credit is less than 80 per cent of the estimate of the total practical take-up of the tax credit, shall lay before Parliament a report setting out the Treasury's estimate of the amount of moneys not spent by reason of the deficiency of take-up in the month to which the estimate relates.
<br>
(4) The Treasury shall cause a sum equivalent to the amount in subsection (3) to be paid into a special account to be called "The National Tax Credit Take-Up Assurance Fund".
<br>
(5) The Treasury shall lay before Parliament each year accounts of the Fund and proposals for its disbursement by way of improvements to the take-up of tax credits."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20516-30_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 22, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 23 and 235. Amendment No. 22 would require the submission of a monthly report to the Treasury giving an account of its care and management of tax credits by the Treasury. In particular, the report would contain the board's estimates of the total possible take-up of each tax credit, and the statistical and other assumptions upon which such estimates are made.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para13"></a>The board's estimates of the total practical take-up of each tax credit and the statistical and other assumptions upon which they are made would be the main part of the report. Together with that would be the actual take-up of each tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para14"></a>The board's monthly reports would be published by the Treasury. If the take-up of any tax credit was less than 80 per cent of the estimate of its total practical take-up, the Treasury would lay before Parliament a report setting out the Treasury's estimate of the amount of money not spent by reason of the deficiency of take-up and the months to which the estimate related.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para15"></a>Amendment No. 23 would add a requirement for the board to include in its reports the amount of tax that has not been paid as a result of tax credits that have been paid to persons otherwise not liable to income tax.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para16"></a>Amendment No. 235 would insert a new clause requiring an annual report to Parliament. The key elements of the annual report would be a total estimate of the take-up of the working tax credit and an estimate of the take-up of the child tax credit, and the number of these in both cases. The report would also contain an estimate of the cost to employers of operating the working tax credit and the child tax credit.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para17"></a>At Second Reading, we discussed at length the central problem that, worthy though the aim of the scheme is, it may fail if take-up is too low. We know that the take-up problem is endemic to the system that the Bill puts in place. I am sure the Minister accepts that this is perhaps the fundamental problem. Many cities have a high level of social mobility and high population turnover. For many people in houses in multiple occupation, getting the post is a nightmare. Readership of local newspapers is low compared with the consumption of other forms of media. The multiplicity of media means that it is more difficult than ever to get a message through to people. Many languages are spoken in our major cities, so it is particularly difficult to reach minority communities, which are often among the poorest.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para18"></a>The take-up of the working families' tax credit is estimated at 62 per cent and that only 72 per cent of entitled families with children had claimed the children's tax credit by December 2001. If those figures are wrong or out of date, I am more than happy for the noble Baroness to correct them.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para19"></a>The result of those low take-up figures is that it has been estimated that &#163;2.6 billion of budgeted expenditure on tax credits this year will go unclaimed. Again, if that figure is wrong or out of date, I would be grateful for the noble Baroness's view of what is the correct figure on the amount saved as a result of the non-take-up of tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para20"></a>We are curious about where this money is and who has it. We are anxious to discover where that money is in the national accounts and whether it is possible for it to be earmarked and retained by those people who are meant to be its ultimate beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para21"></a>I shall not dwell on the issue any longer at this hour. Those are the purposes of this group of amendments. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-30_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   We are discussing three amendments. We have sympathy with two of them, but not as much sympathy with the first. I have major doubts about the sense of trying to pull this particular plant up by its roots every month. We have seen the report. It is not the kind of regime that is susceptible to sensible review on such a short timescale.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para22"></a>I am also doubtful about the benefit of setting up the kind of assurance that the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, refers to. I am not a great expert on the way this credit will work in practice, and I am not sure how far payments of credit can be backdated. However, as long as there is provision for that to happen within a reasonable period, I doubt whether there is a necessity for a separate fund to be established.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para23"></a>Where we have sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is when it comes to the submission of an annual report. One of the great problems generally with legislation is that huge amounts of effort are spent in this Chamber and another place discussing how it will work and very little effort is then spent looking at how well it does work. In this case, there are a number <P>


<a name="column_CWH50"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of key potential and actual problems with the working of the credit which deserve to be reported upon and considered by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20516-30_para24"></a>The take-up is an absolutely key point. The question of fraud is another obvious point and the cost to employers, which we have already discussed, is another area which should be kept under full review. Therefore, while we have some serious problems with the first of these amendments, the second and third are eminently sensible and we hope that the Government will feel able to accept them.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 235 attempt to impose an obligation on the Board of Inland Revenue to produce and publish an annual report on its care and management of tax credits and to submit to the Treasury monthly reports on the take-up of tax credits. As I am sure Members of the Committee are aware, it is not appropriate for that kind of commitment to appear on the face of the Bill. There are other methods of scrutinising the impact of policy and how it is administered.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para0"></a>Indeed, there are already well-established ways for Parliament to scrutinise precisely the information that noble Lords wish to be reported. The Board of Inland Revenue currently publishes an annual report covering all that department's activities and from 2003 it will also cover tax credits. That report is presented to Parliament by the Paymaster General, so it may be that that addresses the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Newby.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para1"></a>Amendment No. 22 attempts to impose an obligation on the board to produce a monthly report on the care and management of tax credits, including take-up and so forth. Again, that is not appropriate. In addition to the annual report laid before Parliament, Parliament may also, if it wishes to pursue the items listed in that amendment, further scrutinise the chairman of the board when he appears before the Public Accounts Committee, and I rather suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, may have done something similar in the past.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para2"></a>The Inland Revenue also produces quarterly statistical reports specifically covering WFTC and DPTC. I do not know whether Members of the Committee receive those automatically but I do and they are extremely long. They show exactly what is happening to payments and movements. A typical one is the quarterly report on working families' tax credit with all the relevant stats. It is always in the Library and in the Printed Paper Office, to the best of my knowledge, and is always available. So that information is already there and we expect to continue to provide it.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para3"></a>Therefore, I should have thought that Members of the Committee already have an annual report as well as a quarterly report with very full information on the workings of the proposed tax credits.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para4"></a>I turn away from the issue of scrutiny to the issue of take-up, which is at the heart of this new clause and also appears in the first half of Amendment No. 235. The take-up of WFTC is encouraging; 1.3 million <P>


<a name="column_CWH51"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>families benefit from WFTC; over 500,000 more benefited from family credit. Those families on average are receiving &#163;35 per week more on WFTC than they would have done on family credit.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para5"></a>As I said at Second Reading, take-up takes time to build. We saw that with family credit which went up from about 60 per cent in cash terms, to nearly 80 per cent and, in people terms, 75 per cent before it was replaced by WFTC. Again, the build-up of WFTC has been very satisfactory, including the fact that many of those who were eligible but did not apply for family credit went on to apply for WFTC because&#151;and this is the main reason for them not applying&#151;the benefit was worth more. Therefore, although we can have statistics about the number of people applying, we also need to see what the cash value is too. Many people, particularly if they are earning &#163;50,000 a year, may decide that it is not worth applying for the family element of, say, &#163;2 or &#163;3 a week, and decide not to do so.
In regard to the take-up of child tax credit, we are assuming that around 5&#190; million families with children will claim and benefit from it. We are publicising that extensively. I do not believe that we need special funds for it, but we are certainly publicising it extensively.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para6"></a>We know already who many of the recipients will be. They are families who are currently claiming WFTC, DPTC and the child tax credit. Those families will be sent a form directly later this year. We also know, obviously, the families on IS and JSA who will be eligible. So there is a lot of automaticity in the process in addition to the publicity campaigns and working with voluntary organisations and so on.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para7"></a>Finally, the amendments would require the board to lay an annual report before Parliament to give an account of its care and management. I had hoped that I had addressed this issue when I referred to the report already presented to Parliament by my right honourable friend the Paymaster General.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para8"></a>Amendment No. 235, also seeks to impose upon the board an obligation to set out an annual report on the cost to employers of operating tax credits. We discussed this issue on a previous amendment. We do not think that it is appropriate. We believe that it is a part of the regulatory impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para9"></a>I am seeking to reassure the Committee that the mechanisms of reporting, scrutiny and ensuring take-up are well in place. Obviously, if noble Lords have any queries or wish to press me further on any of those three issues, I shall do my best to respond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-31_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Somewhere in some kind of platonic heaven where Sir Humphrey keeps his inner Cabinet, there is, I suspect, a model government answer of a speech opposing an amendment for an annual report. One day, some time on, some future historian will have a great deal of fun going over the different models of that standard speech and trying to work out what change brought about which revision and whether they happened once a year or once every 50 years.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para10"></a>In this instance, perhaps there is a case for a revision. I know perfectly well that the Inland Revenue issues an annual report, but we are asking here&#151;and this is part of the glory&#151;for a considerable change of culture in both of the departments involved. If it does not produce that it will not be the success which we on these Benches hope and believe that it will be.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para11"></a>It is perfectly possible for the Inland Revenue to produce an annual report which is very full, very detailed, and a great burden on the Minister's desk, but which does not really concentrate on the points involved in Amendment No. 235. One way of bringing about the cultural change that we want would be to invite the production of an annual report which concentrates on precisely those points where we are looking for cultural change.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para12"></a>One sees in any public service job the effect of being constantly asked for information on some particular issue. It may create resentment but it also creates the desire at least of producing an appearance of doing something in that area. That may, in a kind of ritual manner, sometimes enter into one's soul and influence the way one thinks. That is a part of the argument for an annual report. Perhaps I may put a suggestion to the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi. I hope we may be seeing this amendment again on Report. Is there any chance of the last clause of Amendment No. 235 reading:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An estimate of the cost to employers of operating the child tax credit and the risk to employees of claiming it"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20516-31_para13"></a>
That is perhaps the balance for which the noble lord, Lord Saatchi, has called.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-31_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   Can I briefly tempt the Minister back to the issue of parliamentary scrutiny of fraud? Is it not the case that the Government have already conducted an investigation into fraud within the working families' tax credit and further indicated their intention that this report would be available to Parliament round about September 2001? Yet here we are, eight months later, with no sight of the report. Does that not in fact justify the principle of there at least being an annual report to Parliament on the basis of scrutiny into fraud and take-up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Let me reflect on the last point and not get in the way of a negotiation between the two Opposition Front Benches on joint amendments to which they may sign up on Report. I agree with the noble Earl. I have never yet dealt with a Bill, either in Opposition or in Government, in which there have not been amendments calling for annual reports, for every negative regulation in sight to be affirmative and, as far as possible, for every affirmative regulation to be on the face of the Bill. I agree that, not necessarily in Heaven, but certainly in some purgatory, there are model speeches for all three of those issues.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para14"></a>What matters first that the department&#151;that is the Inland Revenue and, to some extent the DWP, because our concern is with abolishing child poverty&#151;knows what is happening and that that information should be obtained in a properly researched, evidence-based way. Secondly, that information should be in the <P>


<a name="column_CWH53"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column CWH53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public domain so that the Government can be held to account for their success or otherwise in meeting the objectives.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para15"></a>I have tried to suggest to the Committee that both of those requirements are indeed the case. We currently monitor WFTC and DPTC regularly from administrative data captured on forms and so on. We supplement this information with data from surveys, such as the Family Resources Survey, the Labour Force Survey and the Families and Children Survey. We also work with the controllers of those surveys to include questions and ask whether the household is receiving WFTC, DPTC or children's tax credit. In addition to that, every quarter we publish those surveys on take-up. That information is there now.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para16"></a>We also have the benefit of the annual report from the Inland Revenue. It would be helpful, if Members of the Committee wish to pursue this, if they could say what precise information is required, which will be quantitatively available. I do not mean risk, because that cannot be quantified in this sort of report. I can make a statement or an assertion, but this does not lend itself to counting. The sort of reports we are talking about lend themselves to counting. However, if there is any further information that noble Lords feel we should scrutinise, I would be very happy to reflect on that. However, I ask noble Lords to understand that surveys and quarterly inquiries require statistics, and statistics require countable units. I am not saying that they are more or less valuable than qualitative information, but we can only count what is countable. Therefore, in terms of reporting in that way, we are dealing with information that is secure and reliable, in the public domain and open to public scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20516-31_para17"></a>If noble Lords wish to write to me and suggest that there are other things that are countable and should be counted, I would be very happy to see whether that was a reasonable request.

<A NAME="20516-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   I thank the Minister for her reply.

<FONT SIZE=3>being treated in that way and published, with full disclosure. We will certainly wish to pursue these concepts of disclosure on Report.
<P>

<a name="20516-32_para0"></a>Perhaps an even more important point, as the noble Earl was saying, is that part of the job of Parliament and the Committee is to focus the minds of Ministers, officials and those who are responsible on the priorities. As much as these clauses are about statistics, they are also about psychology and focus. I hope we will come back to these on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Lord Rooker on 22 January (WA 195), whether they still expect the design and development of the central register of persons who have applied for or have been granted a shotgun or firearm certificate on the Police National Computer, as required by Section 39 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, which came into force on
1 October 1997, to be completed by the end of May 2002 and for all work to be completed in November 2002; and, if not, whether they will set a new timetable for the implementation of this legislative requirement.[HL4179]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Rooker): </B>  I understand from the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) that development of the central register has been re-scheduled to take into account the work which was needed to implement the DNA database and other external factors. The transition from development to pilot operation will now start in September. The pilot operation will run from November to February 2003, with roll-out to all forces completing in May 2003. PITO continues to plan the delivery of a number of new applications on the Police National Computer in parallel to make the most effective use of skilled and technical resources. But it is possible that other work needed in relation to other urgent PNC projects on persistent offenders and on sex and violent offenders could have a further impact on these re-planned dates. The full impact cannot yet be assessed but could lead to a further delay of two to four months.

Such assets need not be capitalised or valued. Examples include Stonehenge and the government art collection.
<P>

<a name="20516w01_para0"></a>The Treasury does not hold any items it believes could be classified as heritage assets within the definitions set out in the Resource Accounting Manual. The appropriate independent verification of this classification decision was provided by external audit of the Treasury's 2000&#150;01 accounts. However, in respect of the proposed auction of the items, as I told your Lordships on 29 October, "It is fair to say that we did not consult as widely as we should have done" (Official Report, col 1175).

<A NAME="20516w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they intend to lay draft regulations before Parliament under Section 68 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 relating to vehicular access over common land.[HL4380]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Draft regulations have been laid in both Houses, together with a regulatory impact assessment and an analysis of the responses made to the draft regulations circulated in July 2001. The Government's objective has been to strike a fair balance between the owners of common land and those who have for many years driven across the land to get to their homes.
<P>

<a name="20516w02_para0"></a>The major change in the regulations is in relation
to the compensation payable. This reflects the Government's view that the compensation payable in respect of older premises, already in existence when it became an offence to drive on common land, should
be a relatively small amount. Owners of premises in existence on or above 31 December 1905 will pay
0.25 per cent of the value of the premises. Owners of those built between 1 January 1906 and 30 November 1930 will pay 0.5 per cent. Compensation in respect of all other premises remains at 2 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20516w02_para1"></a>We hope that the regulations will be considered by both Houses before the Summer Recess and will then come into force as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  Differences seen in the mineral content of fruits and vegetables will be due to a wide range of factors, including study methodology, variety, growth and storage conditions. The Food Standards Agency advises that available evidence does not support the conclusion that fruit and vegetables grown by organic methods consistently contain larger quantities of essential mineral than those grown using artificial fertilisers. The Government have no plans to commission research into comparative mineral levels in organically and conventionally grown crops.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Young  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they consider that the decision by a major supermarket to make the morning-after pill available to girls under 16 encourages them to commit an offence of unlawful sexual intercourse.[HL4223]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  There is no evidence that the provision of contraception encourages sexual activity. Emergency contraception is a safe and effective method of preventing unplanned pregnancy and is considered to have the same safety profile for under 16s as for older women. As there is evidence that the method is most effective when the first dose is taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex, early uptake is vital. The provision of emergency contraception through National Health Service funded pharmacy schemes, including pharmacies within supermarket chains, is one of the ways in which local areas are seeking to improve access.
<P>

<a name="20516w02_para2"></a>Pharmacists providing emergency contraception to under-16s do so under the established legal framework for all health professionals. This involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to
their parents. Pharmacists are trained to ensure that young women are informed about and encouraged
to visit local services that provide regular forms of contraception and condoms to protect against sexually transmitted infections.
<P>

<a name="20516w02_para3"></a>The Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy recognises the importance of helping young people resist peer pressure to have early sex, while seeking to ensure that those who are sexually active have easy access to high quality contraceptive advice, including emergency contraception. Under-16s are at particular risk of unprotected sex. Although over a quarter are sexually active, they are less likely than older teenagers to access services and use contraception.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_wqn3"></A><B> Baroness Young  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they believe that widespread use of the morning-after pill will reduce the rate of unplanned pregnancy; and, if so, what has led them to that conclusion.[HL4224]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  Emergency hormonal contraception is a safe and effective method of preventing pregnancy when a woman has had unprotected sex or when she knows something has gone wrong with her usual method. Regular methods of contraception such as the pill or condoms should be the first choice to protect against unwanted pregnancy, but in emergency situations women should be able to access this product quickly and easily. Evidence from a World Health Organisation trial demonstrated that emergency contraceptive pills prevented 86 per cent of expected pregnancies when treatment was initiated within 72 hours of unprotected sex. However this rose to 95 per cent when the first dose was taken within
24 hours of unprotected sex. We therefore want to <P>


<a name="column_WA69"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column WA69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensure the best possible access to emergency contraception for those that need it.
<P>

<a name="20516w02_para4"></a>Increased availability of emergency contraception should be seen in the context of a much wider programme of work we are undertaking to reduce the high number of unwanted pregnancies in this country through the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy and the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. This includes improving access to contraceptive services and the range of contraceptive products that are available.

<P>

<a name="20516w02_para5"></a>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists considered this issue in its evidence-based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000) and concluded that published studies strongly suggest that infertility is not a consequence of uncomplicated induced abortion.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  The total government expenditure on research in any given year is not normally allocated in advance to specific diseases.

By 2003&#150;04, the Government will be spending an additional &#163;20 million a year on the new National Health Service infrastructure for cancer research. This will mean that more cancer patients, including lymphoma patients, will have access to new and experimental treatments.

<A NAME="20516w03_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Mancroft </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why they have decided to restrict the frequency of draws in society lotteries to "no greater than one a day" (paragraph 4.43 of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's report A safe Bet for Success) when such a limit does not exist for the National Lottery, which currently has three draws each Saturday; and[HL4277]
<P>
What information or research data they have which shows that society lotteries with frequent draws encourage players to gamble to excess; and[HL4278]
<P>
What they consider to be "excessive" gambling, in monetary terms, in respect of (i) society lotteries, (ii) amusement-with-prizes and (iii) the National Lottery by individual players and by outlet; and[HL4279]
<P>
In relation to Sir Alan Budd's review (Cm 5207) (a) how many of the 300 submissions raised concerns <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_WA72"></a>

<B>16 May 2002 : Column WA72</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>about the frequency of draws in society lotteries; (b) from where Sir Alan Budd obtained the information contained in paragraphs 28.38 to 28.41 of his Report; (c) what information officials gave to Sir Alan Budd in connection with the frequency of draws in society lotteries; and (d) why officials withheld from Sir Alan Budd the results of society lotteries with frequent draws in the possession of the Home Office demonstrating that no excessive play took place; and[HL4280]
<P>
Whether they have calculated the potential loss to charities if draws in society lotteries are restricted to one a day; and, if not, whether they will now do so.[HL4281]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20516w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The Government's decision that the frequency of on-line draws for society lotteries should be restricted to one a day in any particular premises reflected the conclusions of the Gambling Review Body that without such a limit there would be opportunities for uncontrolled and excessive play carrying risks encouraging problem gambling.
<P>

<a name="20516w03_para2"></a>The available research evidence is as set out in Chapter 17 of the review body's report. It is not specific to lotteries but relates generally to frequency of play and opportunities for re-staking.
<P>

<a name="20516w03_para3"></a>Excessive gambling is not necessarily simply a question of the money which the gambler spends or even of the relationship of such expenditure to the gambler's income. It is a matter also of the gamblers' ability to control his or her gambling.
<P>

<a name="20516w03_para4"></a>Four submissions last autumn to the Government about the report of the Gambling Review Body expressed concern about frequent draw lotteries. The review body was independent of government. The sources of evidence given to it were listed in its report. The Home Office did not give evidence about lotteries or other subjects. The only information about the results of society lotteries with frequent draws which was available to the Home Office was supplied by Interlotto. This information related to ticket sales and not to the extent of play by individual participants. It was open to Interlotto to provide this, or such other material as it wished, to the review body in response to the review body's general invitation to submit evidence.
<P>

<a name="20516w03_para5"></a>We have made no estimate of the potential loss to charities from controlling the frequency of online lottery draws and do not think that this would serve a useful purpose. The Government have made clear in A safe bet for success that we are committed to the success of the charity lottery sector and we shall be introducing legislation very shortly to increase their maximum ticket sales, prizes and ticket prices.
