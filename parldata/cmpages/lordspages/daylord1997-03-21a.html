In working to these targets the Meat Hygiene Service will be giving effect to the comprehensive programme of action which my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced on 12 March. Once this range of measures has been implemented, we would anticipate repeating, if possible before April 1998, the thorough audit of hygiene standards in each individual plant which was carried out in 1995-96. For this campaign on hygiene standards to succeed, it will be essential for the industry to give full co-operation both collectively, through the Industry Forum of the Meat Hygiene Service and the Government/Industry Group instituted by my honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary, and in day-to-day operations in individual plants.

<A NAME="70321w01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   The Government's asylum policy aims to deter those entering this country for economic reasons. Those who come here genuinely to seek asylum and make that known on entry to the country have access to income support, income based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit where they have no other means of support while their asylum claim is under consideration. Individuals suffering mental health or other health problems have access to NHS and social care services while their application for asylum is being considered. As with all cases, it is for local decision what kinds of service are provided to meet an assessed need.

A number of aspects of human rights practice of both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities continue to cause us concern, and we raise specific issues regularly with both.

<UL>Whether the Police Service intercept (1) electronic e-mail communications via a domestic e-mail provider; (2) electronic e-mail communications via a non-domestic e-mail provider but passing through the United Kingdom; or (3) any parts of such communications; and, if so, what is the statutory or other legal authority for such interceptions.

This applies equally to voice and data transmission.

<A NAME = "70321w02_para1"></a>It would be an operational matter for the police whether, within the statutory provisions these techniques are used.
