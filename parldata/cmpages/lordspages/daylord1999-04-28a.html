<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are still committed to the principle of reciprocity in their consideration of the allocation of airline traffic rights to the United States.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the Government always seek to get the best terms for UK interests as a whole. We shall push very hard for true reciprocity of traffic rights.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. I was prompted to ask the Question because of the request by American Airlines Federal Express for permission to fly from Prestwick and Stansted. The consultation period expires at the end of this week. Is it still the position that we stand firm by our policy of granting rights only on a reciprocal basis? That is of the greatest importance to this young industry with 75 aircraft and 4,000 employees. It needs reciprocal rights for continued growth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Government have always taken the view that, wherever possible, we should achieve reciprocal rights in our dealings with the United States. As noble Lords will be aware, that has been a difficult task in many of our negotiations with the United States. In relation to the FedEx application, we are pressing hard for reciprocity. There are a number of other issues involved, including employment issues. We are aware of the UK cargo carriers' concerns in particular. Those will be taken fully into account. As my noble friend indicated, we are undertaking wide consultation, the full results of which will be known at the end of this month. We shall make a decision shortly thereafter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Geddes: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware--I am sure that he is--of the report of the European Select Committee of your Lordships' House of November last year on airline competition policy in which strong recommendations were made for reciprocity, particularly <P>


<a name="column_302"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with regard to the United States? In that context, will he comment on the present restrictions whereby no more than 49 per cent ownership of a US airline is allowed by non-US citizens relative to 25 per cent in Europe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I fear that in this context the attitude of the United States Administration does not indicate clearly their commitment to free trade and liberalisation. Not only is there a more or less blanket restriction on cabotage, there are also greater restrictions than pertain in Europe on ownership, wet leasing and various other aspects. We are attempting to get the US Administration to change their view on this. It will require some heavy negotiations to get some movement, but it is our intention to do so. We believe that in the long run that will be in the interests of the United States and aviation as a whole.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northfield: </B>   My Lords, this disagreement has been going on for years, even longer than the disagreement over bananas--and that is saying something. Can my noble friend say what point has now been reached and whether some breakthrough is in prospect? It has gone on long enough on both sides of the Atlantic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely correct. The last time I was employed in the aviation industry was nearly 30 years ago and these issues were more or less present then. We are continuing to negotiate. We are attempting to do so at the highest level. My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister met the US Transportation Secretary last week. Both sides agreed that we should get the talks back on track. The UK now intends to have a round of informal talks with the Americans in May and the formal talks will resume in June. I cannot pretend that this is an easy negotiation, but we believe that we can make some progress on liberalisation within the US. It is very important to the future of British aviation that we reach an understanding on UK-US services. We are the market leaders, but we also recognise the importance of the US market.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, do these rights include the rights to popular slots at Heathrow which are very much sought after? If so, and if more become available to the United Kingdom as a result of these negotiations, will the Government ensure that domestic flights within the United Kingdom are not frozen out but are given some priority?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the question of slots is extremely complex and there is no clear consensus of the way in which we should proceed. The Government are clear that the slots are not the property of individual airlines, but the current system gives the airlines a fair amount of scope over how they use them and the swops in which they are prepared, for <P>


<a name="column_303"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one reason or another, to engage. It is not the intention of the Government that any alteration of the slot situation should disadvantage domestic airlines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gladwyn: </B>   My Lords, in seeking the views of interested parties on the matter of the Federal Express application, the DETR seems to be opening the possibility of conceding rights unilaterally. Is that wise at a time when we are marshalling all our arguments for the forthcoming bilateral negotiations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, every case has to be taken on its merits and full agreement on the broad issue is unlikely in the same time-scale as a decision on FedEx. Nevertheless, I repeat that we are negotiating hard to ensure reciprocity in the FedEx case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that every case has to be taken on its own merits. However, at the same time, he said that negotiations on the existing Bermuda 2 agreement might take place as soon as June. But why should this application be taken separately from a full negotiation on Bermuda?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I said that the further round of formal talks would take place in June. No doubt the prospects for that will become apparent before a final decision is taken on FedEx. However, I would be misleading the House if I were to give the impression that June would be a likely date for a final conclusion of all outstanding issues between the United States and the UK. It is a much more complex and long-term process than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, is it not true that in negotiations between the UK and the United States the main card in the hands of the latter is cabotage for our airlines within the states and that our main card is the availability of slots at Heathrow? Can the Minister tell the House what effect the delay in negotiations for putting forward the association between British Airways and American Airlines, caused by the direction from the EU that BA should give up some of its important slots, will have on any other negotiations between the UK and the US?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I think it would be wrong to suggest, as the noble Baroness does, that there is a direct trade-off between cabotage rights within the US and developments on slots at Heathrow. Obviously cabotage rights in the US represent, in total, a massive access to a new market, which we believe we should be pursuing. As I have indicated, the issue of slots at Heathrow is a more constrained area of flexibility, given the pressure that is put on those slots in any case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-01_para0"></a>As far as concerns the BA/American Airlines position, the House will recognise that, although that may have implications for future UK/US relations in such areas, the whole situation is under review by the competition authorities in at least three places. In those circumstances, I could not possibly comment further.

<P>
<UL>Whether they have any plans to expand opportunities for boys and young men, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to engage in sport and other outdoor leisure activities.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government demonstrate their commitment to young people's support through lottery funding and funding from the New Opportunities Fund, Sport England's Active Schools programme and the Sportsmatch sponsorship incentive scheme among many other initiatives. Recommendations on sport's role in promoting social inclusion will appear in a forthcoming report by the Policy Action Team on Arts and Sport. A new strategy for sport, which will be published later this year, will set the framework for the expansion of sporting opportunities for both boys and girls.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that immensely encouraging reply. Indeed, I should confirm my commitment to young women having comparable rights to young men, but I dare say that the noble Lord would agree that young men have certain special problems. However, is the Minister aware that the recent report of a survey published by Young Voice and Oxford University, which inquired into the views of 1,400 young men, found that boys with low self-esteem were much more likely to develop depression, to be involved in truanting from school and to be in trouble with the police? Is he further aware that the report found that sport was an important contributor towards the building of self-esteem? Can the Minister give an assurance that schools are not now free to sell off their playing fields as has happened in the past?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing my attention to this most interesting report, entitled Leading Lads. He is right in saying that boys and young men with low self-esteem--about 12 per cent, I believe--would be particularly helped by an expansion of opportunities in sport, in drama and in clubs. Without doing more than give a trailer for the report of the policy action team, I can say that it comes to very much the same conclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-02_para0"></a>As to selling off playing fields, I believe the noble Lord will know that we have put a stop to a practice which became far too prevalent under the previous government. Indeed, any application to sell off playing fields, other than for sporting purposes, has to be referred directly to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord the Deputy Chief Whip keep on reminding his right <P>


<a name="column_305"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 305</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>honourable and honourable friends about the importance of out-of-hours use of school playing fields? Indeed, is there not scope for reintegrating pupils who are at risk of suspension or expulsion from school by using some of the very valuable extra funds recently provided by the Government for their continued education?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I happen to live opposite a school playing field and my road is never so busy as it is on Saturdays and Sundays. There is much more out-of-school use than there is in-school use. That is very welcome. We certainly encourage schools to make their playing fields available for community use as well as for school use during out-of-school hours.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister feel, as I do, that for some of us--a minority--deliverance from sport was the saviour of our school careers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord knows that he tempts me. I used to go to the cinema on sports afternoons. However, I have already made that confession in the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Janner of Braunstone: </B>   My Lords, are the Government aware of the immense possibilities that sports present to promote good relations and understanding between young people of different races, backgrounds and faiths, such as the extraordinary new scheme in which the Arsenal Football Club and the Maimonides Foundation have joined together to bring Moslem and Jewish youngsters together to coach them and enable them to compete against each other in mixed teams?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware of the scheme to which my noble friend refers but I am glad to hear about it. If he cares to visit the sports field that is opposite my house on Saturdays and Sundays he will see that the teams are racially mixed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Platt of Writtle: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the importance of sail training for both boys and girls whether from disadvantaged or public school backgrounds? In a force 8 gale, when the sails have to come down from the yards, the one thing they all know is that they are all in the same boat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I take the noble Baroness's question seriously despite her joke on the subject. Of course she is right that sail training is character forming.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that some of the most disadvantaged young people are those who are in trouble with the police and who may even be on probation? Is he aware that in Northern Ireland the Duke of Edinburgh Award and the Outward Bound Scheme have extremely close links with the police who run a rambling scheme especially for these disadvantaged people? Will the <P>

<A NAME="90428-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that sounds like a sensible suggestion which could usefully be extended beyond Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  My Lords, recent reports have indicated that, very regrettably, some non-combatants may have been killed as a result of NATO air activity. I am unable to give a figure for the number of casualties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to my noble friend for that Answer. However, if he consults the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act 1995 he will find that much of the bombing--not only the bombing of Belgrade television station--is illegal under an Act of this country. Under these circumstances does he recognise that an offence has been committed which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment? Will he advise his senior colleagues in his department to consider their position carefully to see whether they should not bring this business to an end forthwith?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it may be helpful to your Lordships if I explain the selection of targets. Ultimate responsibility for the selection of targets attacked by British air assets lies, and will always lie, with the Secretary of State. He has delegated some of that discretion to junior commanders. In his absence I, too, am responsible for choosing targets, again subject to his authority. Every single target that has been attacked by British aircraft has been cleared with the British Attorney-General.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Moyne: </B>   My Lords, do Her Majesty's Government accept that the chief result of the NATO bombing has been to accelerate the ethnic cleansing it was supposed to prevent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend acknowledge that for every regrettable Serbian casualty as a result of NATO bombing, hundreds and possibly thousands of Kosovar Albanians have been brutally murdered by Serbian paramilitaries and military?

<P>

<a name="column_307"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to point out that I do not think I have ever known a military campaign in which one side has been so fastidious about the use of weapons or its choice of targets. We have flown some 10,000 missions. There have unfortunately been two or three instances of the kind that have been mentioned. We have lost one plane and brought the pilot back. I think that is a quite remarkable tribute to the professionalism of all NATO forces.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, given that much of the Serbian Orthodox hierarchy opposes Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, does the noble Lord agree that it was a great mistake, apart from other considerations, to bomb Serbia on the Orthodox Easter Sunday, particularly as the allies rightly took great care not to bomb Iraq during Ramadan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, we did bomb Iraq during Ramadan.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there have been about 200 casualties in Serbia and probably a good deal more elsewhere, particularly in Kosovo, as a result of this war? Does my noble friend also agree that nothing has been achieved of any use, either to the Kosovar people, nor indeed to the Serbian people, and that if this campaign continues in its present form all that will result will be more refugees and more casualties, both in Kosovo and in Serbia itself? Has not the time now come to reassess NATO's view of the situation, to negotiate and to reach a settlement which is acceptable to both sides?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, of course my noble friend would not expect me to agree with the premise underlying his question. We are happy to bring the bombing to an end just as soon as Mr. Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops who are harassing Kosovar civilians, and to the return of civilians under the protection of an international force which will be NATO led, and that there will be no harassment in the future. I should have thought that any civilised person on this planet would accept those objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the NATO objective of removing the Serbian forces and allowing the Kosovar people to return to their homes must be achieved by next winter if appalling loss of life and suffering are to be avoided in the camps? Will the Minister give an assurance that any military forces which are necessary to achieve that objective will be deployed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am sure your Lordships would agree that the resolution of NATO--all 19 countries--to achieve these objectives is absolutely unanimous and the determination is total.

<A NAME="90428-03_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ezra </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress has been made in improving the finances and the operations of the London Underground.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, London Underground's financial performance has improved steadily over the past seven years. Service levels increased by 6 per cent during 1997-98 and a further 8 per cent increase is planned for 1999-2000. Nevertheless there remains a great deal to be done. Reliability and punctuality are still not good enough and that is why the Government are developing our plans for a public/private partnership to create a modern underground for London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. However, does he not agree that there has unfortunately been a delay in the setting up of the public/private partnership which could extend for a year or more beyond the original objective of May 2000? The question then arises of what happens to the financing of the London Underground in that interim period. Would it still have--as it has had to do in past years--to adopt a policy of stop-go in its financing in order to accommodate those developments? That would be particularly unfortunate in view of the increased use of the underground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I recognise the increased use of the Underground to which the noble Lord refers. It plays an important part in the improvement of services. As to the situation of the PPP, clearly it is a very complex negotiation. It is intended to raise &#163;7 billion-worth of investment, which involves serious negotiations that we are not prepared to rush. In terms of current investment, the Government have already made available an extra &#163;365 million to London Underground over the next two years which will mobilise up to &#163;1 billion of investment to take the tube system into the <P>


<a name="column_309"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new millennium. I do not think that taking care in getting the PPP into place will be detrimental to London Underground's investment programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister received any information from Railtrack about integrating underground sub-surface routes with Railtrack's network? Can he comment on that? Will he ensure that if such a scheme goes ahead, it will not be to the detriment of Railtrack's expenditure and the commitment of management to its existing network?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, Railtrack has put forward some proposals for integrating the London Underground sub-surface lines into the mainline network, for which infrastructure it is responsible. We are looking at those proposals, but no decisions have been made. Railtrack has not submitted a bid and we are not negotiating indirectly with Railtrack. To imply that that could divert Railtrack from the much-needed investment on the existing mainline rail network is therefore wrong. We would not wish to end up with such a situation. Nevertheless, we are assessing Railtrack's proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I, for one, am amazed at the complacency of his original Answer? When did he last meet travellers on, for example, the Northern line? When did he last travel on the Underground?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I last travelled on the Underground a couple of days ago. As noble Lords will know, I quite frequently use the Underground. As I said in my original Answer, I find that reliability and punctuality are still not good enough. That is one of the reasons why we need to mobilise this new investment and this new approach to the management of the assets of London Underground to take us into the next century. We have already mobilised some PFI money; a &#163;1 billion deal will introduce the Smart card, which will be of great benefit to passengers, and we also have a PFI deal relating to the power distribution network, which again should have the effect of improving service and reliability. I do not think it is appropriate to talk of complacency. Clearly, the Government and London Underground recognise that a lot more needs to be done. The users of London Underground recognise that fact every day.

<A NAME="90428-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the report produced by three distinguished transport experts which was commissioned by the London School of Economics? The report urges the Government to change their plans for the Tube "before it is too late". Will the Government take that report into consideration? The noble Lord has said that the PPP is likely to be delayed. When can we expect it to happen?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of that report and of other comments intended to divert the Government from their intention. However, we are determined to deliver the PPP. We believe it is the best <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>way forward. It will mobilise the resources that we are seeking. Other alternatives, including those put forward by the Opposition, would not meet our objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister confident that he will be able to travel from Westminster by Underground to the Millennium Dome when it is opened?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Yes, my Lords. As noble Lords will know, the Jubilee line extension is due to open in three stages. We are confident that the final stage will be open well in time for the opening of the dome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Moyne: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is a very conspicuous notice in Westminster station which states that the new station will be finished by 1998?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, at one point that matter was drawn to my attention. I had hoped that London Underground would have removed that notice by now. Westminster station is open; the issue is when the Jubilee line extension will be open. We are confident that it will be open by the late autumn, in plenty of time for the millennium celebrations.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask a Question of which I have given private notice, namely:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90428-03_para0"></a>Whether the Welsh Assembly has the power to revoke or amend the beef on the bone regulations?

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90428-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  My Lords, the National Assembly for Wales will have the power to revoke or amend the controls on the sale, use and disposal of beef bones in Wales, including the ban on beef on the bone. The Beef Bones Regulations 1997 are made under the Food Safety Act 1990, which is included in the transfer order made by both Houses. But in considering whether to take such a step no doubt the National Assembly for Wales will take into account the advice of the relevant Chief Medical Officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House warmly for allowing me to ask the Question and the Minister for his reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-03_para1"></a>With some sadness and temerity I must ask the noble Lord why, in Hansard on 2nd June 1998 (in columns 214, 215, 226 and 229) the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, assured the House that the beef on the bone order would not be devolved. The Government opposed an amendment that I and my fellow Back-Benchers supported and won a Division so that it would not be devolved. This was followed on 21st April of this year <P>


<a name="column_311"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by a Statement in the Commons that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, was wrong and that, as we have heard from the noble Lord, the order will be devolved. I am greatly confused. The Minister may or may not know that, as the matter has become a political football in Wales, the Welsh electorate wants to know exactly what Westminster has decreed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for the absence of my noble friend; he is unavoidably abroad. Perhaps I may explain the matter. At the time my noble friend made his Statement to this House in June last year it was indeed the Government's position that this issue would be a joint responsibility between the National Assembly and MAFF. That position was subsequently changed and it was decided that it would be devolved to Wales. That fact was stated to the House of Commons by Alun Michael on 24th February of this year. It was decided that that responsibility would be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales. The matter is explained by the passing of nine months and the evolution of policy. When my noble friend made the Statement, that was the Government's position and their advice to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that what he has just told us is quite amazing? Anyone can make a mistake in making a Statement, I appreciate that, but he is telling us that the National Assembly of Wales will be able to allow Welsh people to eat beef on the bone--presumably it will be the case in Scotland--and yet Welsh and Scottish MPs can come to England and vote to prevent English people from eating beef on the bone. That surely cannot be right. Is it not about time that Ministers took hold of themselves, had some guts and told the medical officers that in their view--I know it is the view of my noble friend--the ban on beef on the bone is absurd and ridiculous? Beef on the bone is of no danger to anyone and the ban should be removed. Why do they not do that?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that before taking any decision on this matter the National Assembly for Wales will take advice from its relevant medical officer and will act accordingly. I should point out to the House that the then Chief Medical Officer for Wales at the time of the decision to ban beef on the bone supported that decision. I am sure that in both areas the evidence will be considered again. We have already stated that the evidence will be considered again in a few months. The risk had declined when it was last assessed but was still considered by the Chief Medical Officer to be such as to justify the ban. That will be considered again in a few months. That advice will influence the decisions we take and I am certain will influence the decisions taken by the National Assembly. I cannot conceive that it will take decisions other than on the best medical advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble Lord understand that the answer he has given raises serious issues, for four reasons? The first is the one <P>


<a name="column_312"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>given by his noble friend Lord Stoddart a moment ago; secondly, because by its decision the Welsh Office seems to have totally undermined the position of his noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, who is a man of the utmost integrity, and indeed of all those Ministers who voted down my noble friend's amendment which would have transferred these powers to the Welsh Assembly; thirdly, because candidates are campaigning in Wales at the moment on the basis that they will use powers that this House was categorically assured they would not be given; and, fourthly, because the Lord Chancellor yesterday asked us to accept that the House of Lords Bill meant what he said it meant. Is it now the Government's position that they can change their mind every 10 months about what they want a Bill to mean?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord with regard to the complete integrity of my noble friend Lord Williams. That is not in question. Policies evolve, as indeed they evolved under previous governments. But we know what the policy is now. This position has been the public position since February. Candidates in the Welsh elections are or could be aware of that. It is certainly being discussed now. Though I have taken my noble friend's advice and have tried to take hold of myself, I do not see the matter in the same light as the noble Lord opposite.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister realise that he has my sympathy in having to come to the Dispatch Box to undo the words used by his noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn when the noble Lord himself should have come to undo the words he used? Those of us who were present for that debate remember that it went on for some time. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, was very, very clear in what he said. Should not the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, have made arrangements to come to the House when this decision was changed in order to inform the House, which was totally misled on that evening? Furthermore, does this Welsh U-turn not open up the interesting position that in Wales beef on the bone will be allowed, in Scotland it will be allowed-- I can assure the noble Lord that it will most assuredly be allowed--whereas in England it will not be allowed? Is this a subtle plot to help Welsh and Scottish beef farmers and disadvantage English ones? Should I get a larger suitcase so that I can bring down beef on the bone every Monday morning for noble Lords here?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all decision-makers will approach that decision responsibly and will take on board the best scientific advice available. As I said, my noble friend Lord Williams is abroad. I have made a Statement on behalf of the Government. My noble friend did not mislead the House. That was the position at the time and that was his advice at the time he made the statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, I had no intention of rising to speak on this issue. That was the last thing on my mind. But is it not the case that one of the misconceptions is that science is about certainty? The <P>


<a name="column_313"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem of course is that science is largely about uncertainty and government have to do the best they can with the uncertainty that science may present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with my noble friend. We were dealing with uncertainty. We have scientific advice that there is risk. The Government's first priority is public health. Forty people have now died in the most horrendous circumstances from the related disease. The Government act, as my noble friend said, in a situation in which there is no certainty but there is risk. We were not prepared to take that risk with public health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, we have had 10 minutes on this Question which, as noble Lords will realise, is the normal practice when taking Starred Questions in an oral form. I think my noble friend has replied to the points which have been substantially made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I have obviously looked up the Companion and taken advice from the Clerks. There is no time limit on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, with respect, I am advised that, except in a case where a Private Notice Question in another place is repeated as a Statement in this House, the normal practice is to follow the conventions which apply to Starred Questions and Oral Questions.

<A NAME="90428-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, in order for us to consider what has happened in the past few minutes, it would be appropriate for there to be a Motion before the House. I therefore beg to move that the House do now adjourn during pleasure for 10 minutes. I have no intention of asking the House to consider that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-04_para4"></a>A very unusual procedure has just taken place. The House has voted on a purely procedural Motion. I understand from those who opposed the Motion that it was done because of the advice given a few moments ago by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House on the Private Notice Question. It must be right for there to be an opportunity to put this matter entirely straight, and for the noble Baroness to explain the position more fully.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-04_para5"></a>The House will know that I have maintained on many occasions that on purely House matters I support the Leader of the House. That was one of the reasons why I did not intervene when she said what she did. However, given the generosity that the noble Baroness had shown in agreeing that the PNQ could take place, I wonder whether she might have been rather hasty in her judgment, considering the tremendous interest on all sides of the House in this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-04_para6"></a>There was a substantial feeling that the House had been misled and that the Minister, for wholly understandable reasons, could not himself be here. There is an election in a few days and the issue has become enormously politicised. One wonders whether the situation could have been better handled either through the usual channels or by the noble Baroness showing the generosity that she had displayed earlier. I move the Motion to give the noble Baroness an opportunity to explain to the House why she reached the decision that she did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely surprised and disappointed by the observations of the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition. As I understood the matter on which we voted, it was a procedural business Motion which had very little to do with the Private Notice Question, except as interpreted by several of his own Back-Benchers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para0"></a>I have always understood that when the Leader of the House offers to the House advice that he or she is given on procedural matters the courtesies of the House are that the Leader of the Opposition supports the Leader of the House. I regret to say that during this Session there have been occasions when that has not occurred and the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and I have then engaged in private conversation and personal exchange of correspondence about situations that have arisen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para1"></a>I am surprised that in this instance he should take the view that he has. The advice I was given was that the PNQ would follow the normal procedure for Oral Questions, not that for PNQs in another place repeated as Statements in this House. If this is a matter of dispute among noble Lords, obviously it is <P>


<a name="column_316"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a subject for the Procedure Committee. My advice to the House is that this kind of procedure should be immediately reported to, and discussed by, the Procedure Committee at an early opportunity. But I do not withdraw my disappointment at the position taken by the noble Lord on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I associate myself with the remarks of my noble friend Lord Strathclyde. The Leader of the House is quite right. Those of us who have had the honour and privilege of being Leader of your Lordships' House have always had the right to expect that the advice we give to your Lordships, with the assistance of the learned Clerks, on matters of procedure should be supported. That is the way in which noble Lords are able to proceed without the intervention of a Speaker as happens in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para2"></a>However, it was clear to me as an observer that there was immense interest on all side of the House in the Private Notice Question tabled by my noble friend Lord Stanley. One wonders whether it might have been possible for the noble Baroness to suggest that the House could have stretched a point in order to accommodate that very obvious interest, noted by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para3"></a>The noble Baroness will be aware, perhaps to a greater extent than anyone else in the Chamber, of the particularly sensitive period through which we are passing where nerves are perhaps nearer the surface than is usual in your Lordships' House. I respectfully suggest to the noble Baroness that it is at moments like these that a little elasticity is welcome. It may be sensible for the House to adjourn for 10 minutes to allow tempers to cool and for us then to proceed to the business of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, we are in danger of making a meal of this on the eve of a number of very important debates. There may have been a misunderstanding. I do not detect one. I believe, however, that the Leader of the House has made a perfectly sensible and widely acceptable suggestion that the matter be sent at an early date to the Procedure Committee which will report back. If the House does not like the report of the Procedure Committee it will reject it. But that is the proper course that the House should take without further delay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, having been the instigator of this fracas--if I may call it that--it is eminently sensible that the rules of procedure should be reviewed as suggested by the noble Baroness. After all, the procedures are designed to serve the House; it is not the House that should serve its procedures. It is perhaps a pity that for want of a little judicial elasticity, which would have held up the business of the House for five minutes or so, we have now delayed business for a considerable time. I have no <P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para6"></a>There was a time when human cloning was regarded as being in the realms of science fiction. It made good reading in books like Boys from Brazil or Brave New World, but it is probable that until the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1997 many of us did not regard this issue as something that we would have to deal with as a matter of public policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para7"></a>Dolly was cloned after 277 attempts, involving nine embryos in the course of the procedures. Yesterday we learnt from the newspapers that in the United States goats had been cloned. The race is very much under way to achieve the cloning of human beings. In a recent "Panorama" programme a Korean scientist, Dr. Lee Bo Yeon, was asked when we might see a cloned baby. His reply was, "Much sooner than you think". That was after his claim--disputed by other scientists--that he had already created and then killed the first human clone. Just before Christmas a document was submitted to the Government by the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. A lot of the preparatory work for that document was carried out by a working party of four people, to which issue I shall return later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para8"></a>Crucial to our understanding of this debate is the distinction that is made between reproductive cloning, which the two authorities considering this issue recommended against, and therapeutic cloning, which they said should be authorised. We are awaiting the response of the Government, and it is for that reason that the debate today is so timely.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para9"></a>Putting the issue into context in one other respect, as we consider our own position it is worth referring to <P>


<a name="column_318"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what other countries are doing at this time. Only a week ago the 19 members of the Council of Europe ruled out any question of human cloning and said that it should not be permitted under any exceptions whatsoever. They have incorporated that protocol into the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. Two countries were absent from signing that protocol. Germany said that in the light of its eugenics history, its own laws, which completely proscribe any experimentation on human embryos, meant that it had already had sufficient provision not to need this protocol. Her Majesty's Government also declined to sign the protocol. Perhaps we may hear from the Minister when she replies why the Government decided not to sign the protocol and where that will lead us as regards the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para10"></a>The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Daniel Tarchys, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At a time when occasional voices are being raised to assert the acceptability of human cloning and even to put it more rapidly into practice, it is important for Europe solemnly to declare its determination to defend human dignity against the abuse of scientific techniques".
Your Lordships will also wish to know that President Chirac, who opened the conference debating this question, added his denunciation of countries which provide a safe haven for those scientists who wish to act outside internationally agreed norms. He said:
<P>
<BR>
"Nothing will be resolved by banning certain practices in one country if scientists and doctors can simply work on them elsewhere".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para11"></a>It is not only in Europe that this issue is a controversial question. In the United States Senate there was a recent debate. Two conflicting Bills were introduced by Senators Bond and Frist, on one side, and Senators Feinstein and Kennedy, on the other. At the end of the stand-off and a filibuster, their Motion to prohibit human cloning was defeated. But I draw to the attention of your Lordships' House a leader from the Washington Post. It said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable. Viewed from one angle this issue can be made to yield endless complexities. What about the suffering of individuals and infertile couples who might be helped by embryo research? What about the status of the brand new embryo? But before you get to these questions there is a simpler one: 'Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific, or other gain, and, if so, what is it?'".
That is the context of today's debate. Is there a bright line which we simply should not cross?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para12"></a>Let us consider our deliberations in the context of the 1967 abortion legislation which we said would be only for difficult cases and that it would not lead to abortion on demand. There have been 5 million abortions since then. Think back to the legislation in 1991, when your Lordships debated the issue of experimentation on human embryos. We were then told that this would only be to help scientists to make progress for what they said would be perfectly legitimate reasons to try to rid the world of terrible degenerative disease or to help infertile couples. I should have thought that even the most enthusiastic supporters of that measure would pause to reflect on the half a million human embryos who have been destroyed or experimented upon since then.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para13"></a>It is perhaps worth considering in this context that every day 600 unborn babies are aborted in Britain but in the whole of the past year only 300 new-born babies were available for adoption. It seems extraordinary that we spend so much energy talking about procedures which often fail. No doubt we shall hear later from one eminent Member of this House about infertility treatments. As the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will know, in up to 70 per cent of cases the infertility treatments still do not work.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para14"></a>I recommend to your Lordships' House an article in the Sunday Telegraph on Sunday last, written by Dominic Lawson, entitled The death of medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para15"></a>The HFEA has permitted scientists in our own country, in Bristol, to inject human sperm to penetrate hamster eggs, and that in Japan, at Tottori University, scientists have grown human sperm in testicles of rats. Is it not again worth asking the question: where is the bright line which we should not cross? In the United Kingdom there have been reports of scientists saying it would be possible to implant a human embryo in a man.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para16"></a>In the Sunday Times on Sunday last, Dr. Paul Rainsbury said he was seeking a licence to split an embryo to create two children, one of whom could then be frozen. Dr. Rainsbury said that the second baby would be an insurance policy. All of that demonstrates how far we have moved from an authentic view of human life--of life as a precious gift from God--to a commodified view in which the language of the market place comes to dominate human procreation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para17"></a>There are dissenting voices. It would be wrong to suggest that all religious views, or for that matter all scientific views, are the same. They are not. Let me draw to your Lordships' attention the words of Dr. John Wyatt, Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics at the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London. He said in a note to me:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I and many of my fellow health professionals share a profound disquiet about the introduction of therapeutic cloning. Many of us are actively involved in research to find novel therapies for life threatening and disabling conditions. However, the creation and manipulation of living human embryos for the sole purpose of generating therapeutic tissue seems incompatible with respect for vulnerable human life. The redefinition of human embryos as mere biological material or 'totipotent stem cells' in order to allay public concerns smacks of semantic trickery rather than responsible debate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para18"></a>I cite these words from the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Basil Hume. He says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Every human embryo is a new human life with the potential to develop into an adult human being. From the moment an embryo is created, we are dealing with a human subject which should always be treated with reverence and respect. It would be morally abhorrent for new human lives to be created simply for harvesting human tissue. Today's development highlights the urgent need for Parliament to amend and restrict the 1990 Act.
<P>
<BR>
It is said that, in the long term, scientific advances in treating disease could be accelerated by the use of this technique. Even if this were true, it cannot justify doing what is wrong: We are dealing with human lives.
<P>
<BR>
This is surely another example of a line which should never be crossed. We may be being clever but are we being wise?".
I repeat: we may be being clever but are we being wise?

<A NAME = "90428-05_para19"></a>Later in the debate we shall hear from my noble friend Lord Jakobovits and from other noble Lords who represent religious and scientific traditions. I was extremely grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich--he cannot be here today--for the letter of support he sent me in the context of our debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para20"></a>That is the context in which contributions will be made today. I turn to some of the principles involved. Human cloning is the production of a genetic copy of another human organism. Cloning would be achieved by embryo splitting or by nuclear transfer. Reproductive cloning would allow the human embryo to develop into a full copy of the donor. But therapeutic cloning would also require the creation of a human embryo. Cell differentiation, leading to continued foetal development, would not be permitted. The purpose would be to grow tissue or perhaps organs for transplant therapies. Both techniques require the manufacture of a human embryo. Growing a human clone for its limbs and organs is technological cannibalism.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para21"></a>Alternatives exist. President Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Committee has stated that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"because of ethical and moral concerns raised by the use of embryos for research purposes it would be far more desirable to explore the direct use of human cells of adult origin to produce specialised cells or tissue for transplantation into patients".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para22"></a>I turn to the process by which we take these decisions. It is extraordinary that this is the first parliamentary debate that we have had in either House about this question. Where has been a committee of the stature of that chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock? Where has been a committee such as that chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, before arriving at these conclusions? Instead we have had four people, all of whom are scientists, and all of whom had expressed previously at some point or another support for human cloning, deliberating on these questions. Just 200 submissions were made as part of their low key consultation and they declined even to place a copy of the responses in the Library of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para23"></a>Earlier this year Sir Colin Campbell resigned as chairman of the Human Genetics Advisory Committee because he said that his commercial interests in an insurance company might lead to a conflict of interest. But if that were right, and it was, how could a man like Dr. George Poste, with his huge interests in Smithkline Beecham, Cerebrus Limited and Dia Dexos, avoid a similar conflict of interest? Other members, too, had interests, and I passionately believe that we need to remove this debate from those who are too close to the industries and who could gain from the procedures in which they are involved. Your Lordships' House is perhaps the one remaining place where these awesome questions may be debated impartially and thoughtfully.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para24"></a>This then is the context, these are the principles and that is the process which led to my tabling today's Motion. Let us be clear what is at stake here. We are witnessing the creation of nightmare kingdoms, populated by a sub-species of human clones. This debate is about nothing less than what it means to be human. We may be on the verge of committing species suicide. A whole range of sociological, psychological and scientific questions arise from this, apart from the <P>


<a name="column_321"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ethical questions which I have raised already. Questions arise about the familial relationships between the cloned individual and the other members of his or her family should reproductive cloning be permitted. There are questions of inheritance, questions of status and so on. We may be committing ourselves to permit something which could have vast consequences, not just for ourselves but for all future generations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para25"></a>Your Lordships will be told in this debate that if we should just permit a little cloning, therapeutic cloning, it could lead to many advances. But this is the bridge across which unethical scientists and pharmaceutical companies will march towards full pregnancy cloning. Our IVF clinics will be awash with cloned human embryos and, sooner rather than later, someone will start implanting them in surrogate mothers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para26"></a>To legalise therapeutic cloning is to render inevitable the onset of human pregnancy cloning. For the Government to give a green light to the former will amount to complicity in the latter. We are hopelessly ill-prepared to answer the complex scientific and sociological questions which are raised by human cloning. Our destiny as a species is the high theme which must engage us today. We will not survive the 21st century with 20th century bio-ethics. We need a moratorium to give us space to think. We need to hear the profoundly important arguments on both sides. Dissenting voices should not be driven out of the committees that consider these matters. One thing is clear: to act in haste will cause us to repent at leisure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para27"></a>My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_time1"></A><H5>3.52 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, the whole House, myself included, will be deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for introducing this interesting debate. It is on what is undoubtedly an issue of importance and one that I agree completely concerns human dignity. I shall return to that a little later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para28"></a>I fear, though, that the noble Lord is confusing a number of different arguments. I was not certain whether he was talking about cloning or about embryo research. They are different issues. He reminds me a little of the noble Lord who points his blunderbuss at a hare and a high pheasant at the same time--and misses both.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para29"></a>The issue is important. The first thing to say very clearly is that it is absolutely certain that British law as it stands prevents, and has prevented, human cloning, and that there is no intention to perform human cloning. Secondly, none of the human cloning experiments to which the noble Lord refers is taking place in this country. This House cannot legislate for what happens in Korea, but I suspect that the statements made by the soi-disant scientist from Korea are not quite as far forward as he might imagine. Certainly, that group has published nothing of scientific merit of which I am aware. The scientific background must be established first.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para30"></a>Perhaps I may knock on the head one theory, the theory that human cloning may be immediately possible. I believe that that is completely untrue. It took a good <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deal more than nine embryos to produce Dolly. In fact, producing one sheep took about 400 embryo experiments. Sheep embryos have an 80 per cent likelihood of implantation in the uterus. Therefore, if one manages to get a clone embryo, one is very likely eventually to get an implantation. With a human it is very different. The best implantation rate that can be expected is well under 20 per cent, so the chances are that to produce one cloned human one would have to do a hundred cloning experiments on women. I do not think there will be many women lining up to have a Saddam Hussein, an Adolf Hitler or indeed a politician in their uterus. I do not see this as a feasible technology.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para31"></a>Moreover, in every experiment involving cloning there have been serious abnormalities in some of the foetuses. It is simply unthinkable that any doctor or scientist would be responsible for an outcome of an animal or human being that was damaged in that sort of way. It is very important that we as doctors and scientists recognise ourselves as the servants of society, not its masters. In this country we are paid through the public sector. We respect the public sector. The scientists here, whom the noble Lord, I fear, tends to impugn with some of his remarks, are deeply conscious of their responsibilities and obey the law absolutely, in every respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para32"></a>Somebody has talked about splitting embryos and making twins. But that is not reproductive or experimental cloning, with all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Alton; it is simply splitting an embryo, which is actually forbidden by law in this country. Anyway, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has refused permission to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para33"></a>In the United Kingdom over the past five years there have probably been some 20,000 clones walking around--all, of course, naturally born twins, identical twins, who as twins are more closely related to each other than would be clones who do not have identical DNA, because the DNA from the egg is different from the DNA of the nucleus.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para34"></a>What is the benefit of this technology, it being agreed that it would be unthinkable to use it in humans? The benefits are very considerable. First--this has never been mentioned--cloning research is capable of producing very important information about the process of ageing, because we do not know at present whether ageing is due to a nuclear change or due to the DNA change in the egg cell. Over time this will help us to study what is of crucial importance to the whole of human medicine. Ageing will be an increasing problem. It is already a major focus of research and development in the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para35"></a>Secondly, we now know that we can reprogramme the nucleus in a cell. This is of colossal importance. I am not making any exaggerated claim when I say that it is of importance in looking, for example, at the mechanisms of cell division, which affect diseases like cancer, and the cell cycle. It is absolutely germane to such researches.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para36"></a>I would add that it is very wrong to confuse the real issue of abortion, about which I know that the noble Lord feels very deeply, with the issue of cloning. They <P>


<a name="column_323"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are not the same issue at all. It may well be possible, using techniques that we are developing, to take tissue from a human embryo without in any way damaging or destroying it, or creating an embryo purposely for the making of tissue. In fact, there are now techniques at our disposal for taking single cells off the inner cell mass of the embryo, and in time they may be grown.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para37"></a>The noble Lord said that there was confusion between human dignity and scientific defects. I would argue that it would be completely unethical not to do this research, given the tools of creation that God has given us. We should be using our God-given intelligence to protect and promote human life. It is absolutely wrong, and counter to human dignity, not to use scientific knowledge for those very reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para38"></a>In the near future, we shall be able to generate from embryonic stem cells, without the destruction of an embryo, skin for burns victims, for children who would otherwise die. We shall be able to grow nervous tissue for people who have neurological deficits. We shall undoubtedly be able to treat leukaemia, from which children and young people are currently dying. We shall be able to treat liver disease, which kills a large number of people each year. We may well be able to replace defective heart muscle by growing it. Already at Hammersmith Hospital my colleagues are growing bone cells from mouse embryos, as I speak. This will be used, I have no doubt, to look at human degenerative disorders. The importance of that work cannot be over-stated.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para39"></a>I should like to ask the noble Lord one final question. When he sums up the debate, will he assure the House that his reasons for introducing the Motion relate purely to cloning and not to the fact that he has a fundamental objection to all in vitro fertilisation techniques which have engendered many tens of thousands of healthy human beings on the surface of this planet?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is with some diffidence that I follow the noble Lord, Lord Winston, because in this House we all know of his expertise in this area. But it is a subject on which I feel strongly and I want to thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for introducing this debate. It is much needed and, like him, I am sorry that there has not been more debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para40"></a>Cellular molecular biology advances at such a rate that it is not only the right but the duty of Parliament to be vigilant, even though the responsibility is onerous and daunting. What is disturbing, especially against the background of the constitutional changes for this House, with the possibility of a much weakened interim Chamber, is the singular lack of discussion of those matters by the House of Commons. Will the Minister tell us whether it is the case that the Government will respond to the recommendations of the working group without a full debate of the issues by the elected Chamber?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para41"></a>Perhaps I may put a question to the noble Lord, Lord Winston. He made the technology sound so futuristic that we are all worrying about nothing. I have <P>


<a name="column_324"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>read this document and it does not speak of the technology as being very futuristic. This is not a purely scientific matter. There are psychological, sociological and theological dimensions which must be given serious consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para42"></a>I found what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said about the working group of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority extremely disturbing. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, is right to question the scientific bias and credibility of the consultation process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para43"></a>Equal prominence should be given to ethical principles in the field of science which is impacting psychologically, sociologically and spiritually on the very fabric of society. I look with hope to the right reverend Prelate to add the voice of the established Church in support of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on the issue of cloning technology.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para44"></a>Those of us who are concerned about unfettered technical scientific advances are often intimidated by the scientists and technocrats. But those who are interested in that area, who understand the wider ramifications and consequences of the new technologies as they unfold, welcome this kind of debate, albeit short, which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has initiated today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para45"></a>My concern is the slippery slope which was warned of many years ago and which fell on so many deaf ears: the incredible number of abortions which are carried out each year; the massive increase in the number of embryos both created and destroyed; and now, cloning, coupled with genetic engineering, is taking place, which is the manipulation of human life on an altogether different plane. It is imperative that much greater and wider consideration should be given to its consequences.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para46"></a>When given the facts about genetic engineering and cloning technological advances, the public display great anxiety and look to the Government to provide a protective legislative framework. I am not impressed by the references to the consultation process in the document. That leaves a great deal to be desired.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para47"></a>In America, scientists have discovered a way of producing completely fatherless children. Some time ago in the county from which I come, a lesbian couple made the media headlines by producing a baby by self-insemination. Their plan was for each of them to have a baby without any physical contact with a man. One child was born to one of the couple and before they could manipulate a second child, the couple split up. Apart from the horror of that so-called "scientific development", what are the social and perhaps even psychological consequences for that child? Some of us believe that playing God in that way is wholly unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para48"></a>The Government must stand firm against such developments in this country. Social instability, breakdown of the family and a high level of insecure children are great issues of our day. But what is the point of wringing our hands about such issues when there appears to be daily incremental acceptance of scientific processes which contribute quite directly to <P>


<a name="column_325"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew8"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for initiating this debate. He is quite right that it is a subject of great consequence and the swift pace of scientific research presents us with some awesome possibilities for the future. Due to the delayed start of the debate, I shall now have to leave before the end as I am due to conduct a confirmation in Oxford.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para49"></a>The Church of England's Board for Social Responsibility, which I chair, is totally opposed to the cloning of embryos for reproductive purposes. That view is shared widely and is reiterated in the report from the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of December last year. The Government therefore have very strong support for their continuing ban.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para50"></a>On research using nuclear replacement technology for therapeutic purposes, there is greater division of opinion. Some are opposed to all research on embryos on the grounds that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of existence, the human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person--among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life".
That is a quotation from the Catechism of the Catholic Church and it is a view shared by a fair number of other Christian people. It is a view I respect deeply but it is not one I share.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para51"></a>I take a developmental view of the human person and believe that the recommendation of the Warnock Report, now enshrined in law, that the formation of the primitive streak 14 days after conception is that clear point beyond which all research should be banned. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, called for a clear line. I believe that that does provide a clear line. Before that point, in the very early cluster of cells, it is not yet clear which will develop into a distinct individual. Furthermore, while the noble Lord emphasises the numbers of embryos which have been kept and then destroyed over recent years, it is a fact that in nature itself as many as three-quarters of the eggs which are fertilised are lost anyway in the normal course of events, most before they implant in their mother's womb about a week after conception.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para52"></a>Although it has been known for centuries that some embryos miscarry spontaneously, the magnitude of very early embryonic loss has been recognised only recently. Nature is amazingly prodigal, not only in the number of acorns produced by each oak and the millions of sperms that are produced but also in the number of fertilised eggs which, in nature, do not come to term.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para53"></a>Reflecting on that prodigality of nature, Professor Gordon Dunstan has written:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Upon this waste, medical intervention imposes an economy. If successful it provides a baby where otherwise there would be none. The genetic information stored in the cells can be read; what is thus learned can be ordered into knowledge; knowledge can be put to beneficial life-saving use. The argument is not that because nature <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_326"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 326</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>is prodigal we may be prodigal; because so much life or potential life is lost, one more does not matter. It is the reverse. It is that nature's prodigality is turned to creative use; natural loss is lessened, albeit to a minute degree".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para54"></a>In the response of the Board for Social Responsibility to the consultation document on Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine, we reflected the fact that the majority opposed the deliberate creation of embryos for experimental purposes but were willing to accept research on spare embryos created as a result of existing infertility treatment. Furthermore, the board believes that nuclear replacement technology should only be used when there are no other ways of doing that particular piece of research.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para55"></a>There are a number of factors that need to be balanced on this issue. First, I believe that we should welcome and celebrate what modern scientific research can achieve. Sometimes, a begrudging spirit can enter into these debates as though the only job of ethicists is to act as policemen and say no. But the capacity to understand the workings of nature and interact with them for human well-being is an aspect of our God-given creativity. It is something to be rejoiced in.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para56"></a>Secondly, it is right to be cautious. There is an accumulated wisdom in the billions of years of evolution. We can rarely predict the full consequences of research. Not everything that can be done should be done. It is the nature of the scientific enterprise always to press on, to think that because it can be done it should be done. It is therefore important that we should have widespread public debate and a proper legal framework for all front-line research. I believe that we can be thankful that we have the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, with its clear mandate and authority for licensing or not licensing particular pieces of research.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para57"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, drew our attention to the many ways in which this research could be beneficial for human well-being and welfare. The report to which reference has been made contains two particular recommendations. One is that in regulations two further purposes should be added to the list of purposes for which the HFEA could authorise a research project. I look forward to hearing anything the Minister is able to say today which might indicate the Government's attitude to the recommendations in the report.

<A NAME="90428-05_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve: </B>   My Lords, I speak in this debate with some diffidence; I am neither a specialist in human reproduction, nor long a Member of your Lordships' House. However, as a member of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission, and since recently its acting chairman, I have had some concern during the past year with the topics we debate today and was involved in the report published by the commission jointly with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. I speak, however, today in my personal capacity and neither for the commission nor as its chairman. I also speak with gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for bringing this important set of subjects to debate.

<A NAME = "90428-05_para58"></a>The frisson which everyone feels at the possibility of the cloning of human beings is understandable. We are only beginning to understand what such reproductive cloning would mean. We have all read of the tremendous scientific difficulties and wastage involved in cloning Dolly. We know that cloning, as at present possible, is not a safe procedure. However, some people think that should reproductive cloning become safe, or at least much safer, then there might be a case for permitting it. I believe that this is doubtful.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para59"></a>However, this is not because cloned persons would lack a unique identity. Having a unique identity is, as has already been said, not a matter of having a unique genetic identity. To have a unique identity is to have a separate body and mind and a life of one's own. That is fundamental to human identity, otherwise we would be speaking of those of us who are monozygotic twins as lacking a unique identity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para60"></a>Reproductive cloning would, I believe, remain a dubious infertility treatment for other reasons, and mainly because if it were adopted it would be intended as a treatment for those for whom other forms of treatment do not work, by which they could have a genetically related child. But, in doing so, they would be taking it upon themselves to bring into the world a child with a genetically ambiguous or confused heritage. For example, if the child is to be a clone of either parent, it will thereby be not only the genetic twin of that parent, but the genetic sibling of its aunts and uncles and the genetic child of its grandparents. We have some knowledge of the additional burdens that ambiguous and confused family relationships may create for children; as, for example, in the case of adoption and step-parents. In this case, however, parents do not plan to put their children into this situation. Would it be right deliberately to plan for children to face quite exceptional levels of ambiguous and confused heritage?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para61"></a>Of course, it may be said that cloning does not have to be of a related person and that if it were of an unrelated person those difficulties would be less. In that case, surely it would be safer, more feasible and ethically more acceptable to have a child by way of adoption--granted that there are great difficulties in that at present. I do not believe that there are any reasons at present to reconsider the ban on reproductive cloning which the 1990 Act sought to impose.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para62"></a>Ethically more difficult concerns raised by cloning technologies do not relate to their use in fertility treatment but to their use in cell nuclear replacement technologies--that is the method by which Dolly was cloned--and the application of those technologies to human eggs. I believe that the considerations which are ethically important for us in this context are those which should govern any use of human tissues, including human reproductive tissues, by which we seek to ensure that human beings are never used as mere means.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para63"></a>Our practice in this area has not been to ban all use of human tissues, but to insist broadly on two ethical conditions. The first is that human tissues be used only for morally valuable and serious purposes, such as curing disease, medical education and research, <P>


<a name="column_328"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>including help for the infertile. The second is that the consent of individuals whose tissue is used should be freely given. These two standards have been used to regulate uses of human tissues from blood transfusion to organ transplantation and in the daily medical practices of retaining pathological specimens for medical follow-up, education and research, as well as in the recent development of IVF.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para64"></a>When we use human tissues as a means to these ends, we do not, I believe, treat the human beings who donate tissues as mere means; we do not instrumentalise them, provided we adhere rigorously to these standards, which are crucial to medical practice that respects human rights and human dignity. These standards will be equally important in regulating any use of cell nuclear replacement technologies in human medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para65"></a>The 1990 Act permits research on human embryos only for 14 days; that is, until the emergence of the primitive streak. Until that stage, the cluster of cells comprising the embryo cannot yet be identified with an individual human being: it is still indeterminate, for example, whether these cells will grow into a single human being or into more than one. While I have the greatest respect for the thought that we become human beings long before we are born, I do not believe that human rights or human dignity can be at issue before there are human individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para66"></a>At present, research on human embryos during the permitted 14-day period is restricted to five specific purposes in Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act. All of those purposes centre on the better understanding of human reproduction. They include advancing the treatment of infertility; increasing knowledge of causes of congenital disease and miscarriage; advancing the techniques of contraception; and developing methods of detecting gene and chromosome abnormality.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para67"></a>The joint report by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Genetic Advisory Commission proposed that two additional purposes might be added to the list by regulation. I shall say nothing about the use of embryonic stem cells. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, spoke about that and I believe that the scientific demands in that area are great.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para68"></a>I wish to comment briefly on therapy for mitochondrial genetic disease because it fits very well into the group of purposes listed in Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act. A woman with mitochondrial genetic disease carries it in all her eggs and will transmit it to all her children. But the mitochondrial DNA is not in the nucleus of the egg. The nucleus of an egg from a woman with such disease might therefore be transferable to a healthy egg donated by another woman and subsequently fertilised in vitro. A healthy child could then be born to a couple, despite the mother's mitochondrial disease. The fertility treatment leading to its birth would involve cell nuclear replacement, but not reproductive cloning, and there would be no ambiguity about the child's heritage.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para69"></a>It may be said that to permit additional purposes for embryo research such as this one and possibly embryonic stem cell research would be to slide down a <P>


<a name="column_329"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>slippery slope. I do not believe that the fear is well founded. Adding these two purposes to the regulations restricting embryo research would not extend the period of permitted research. It would not alter the fundamental ethical standards which would govern research on human beings and human tissues. There is no ethical innovation proposed. There is simply a matter of taking cognisance of scientific developments.

<A NAME="90428-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, it is my very great honour to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve, on her superb maiden speech. Her distinguished background as a philosopher and her role as chairman of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission have equipped her perfectly for this afternoon's subject. We are very much in her debt for her wise words. I am sure her mind will be brought to bear on numerous other subjects in your Lordships' House. In my speech at Second Reading of the House of Lords Bill, I hoped that Members of any future House would be uncommonly able rather than uncommonly privileged. The noble Baroness fits the bill precisely and will greatly strengthen the interim House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para70"></a>I turn to the debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for which I thank him. First, to consider human reproductive cloning rather than "therapeutic" cloning, the HFEA report suggests that the Government
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may ... wish to consider the possibility of introducing primary or secondary legislation explicitly banning reproductive cloning".
I hope very much that the Government will not go down that road despite the strong public opinion which at present is expressed against human reproductive cloning. The report also states:
<P>
<BR>
"The Government has explicitly ruled out reproductive cloning and the HFEA has stated its policy that it will not license the use of nuclear replacement for this purpose".
In other words, it is highly unlikely that reproductive cloning could be allowed under present rules. That is a proper decision because, as other noble Lords have already pointed out, the technique is still imperfectly developed. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, mentioned the 277 attempts before Dolly the sheep was successfully implanted and delivered.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para71"></a>However, there may well be a time in a decade or so when these difficulties will largely be overcome and a strong case for allowing a very small number of cloned individuals may be made. The current reaction to this is one of shock-horror, with visions of regimented identical individuals of servile rank, as in Brave New World, as pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, or of evil nature as in The Boys from Brazil. Current regulations would virtually rule that out. The mad scientist who, having learned the techniques, uses them for malevolent purposes is most unlikely to appear. In any case, if he wanted to do this so strongly, he would disobey any prohibition, however draconian.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para72"></a>The current popular rejection of human reproductive cloning was examined critically by Professor Raanan Gillon, head of the medical ethics unit of the Imperial College School of Medicine in his Stevens Lecture at the Royal Society of Medicine last June. He divides the <P>


<a name="column_330"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opposition to this process into four categories: first, moral repugnance, including gut reactions of "yuk", horror, offence, playing God and so on; secondly, issues of autonomy, dignity and identity; thirdly, issues of psychological harm or benefit to the parent or the individual concerned; and, finally, issues of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para73"></a>In every one of those categories Professor Gillon finds that, cutting through and eliminating purely emotional responses, there is a very plausible case for reproductive cloning as well as one against it. I cannot take the House through his reasoning. The lecture contains 10,000 words which I suggest all concerned with making decisions in this area should read. However, I shall quote one illustrative paragraph which will, perhaps, introduce a slightly lighter note into what is otherwise a rather sombre debate. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An analogy which I like to use concerns medical practice. Doctors, especially surgeons, cut people up quite a lot; they also stick their fingers in people's bottoms. Most of us, I imagine, would feel quite deeply that both of those activities are rather disgusting and not to be done; yet we know, through thought and reflection in our medical studies, that we had better overcome these deep feelings because in some circumstances it is right to cut people and in some circumstances it is right to put our fingers in people's bottoms. Both are extraordinary and counter-intuitive things to do, but on analysis we find that they are sometimes the right thing to do".
Having said that, he does, however, agree with the HFEA that at present we should prohibit human reproductive cloning because it has so many dangers in its present state of development; but, we should not close it off completely for the future. I hope that the Government will accept that the current state of regulations for human reproductive cloning is sufficient.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para74"></a>I intended to say a little about so-called "therapeutic" cloning. However, I see that my time is up. That issue has already been covered by a number of noble Lords so at this point, I shall sit down.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Patel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may break with convention and congratulate my noble friend--truly my friend--Lady O'Neill of Bengarve on an outstanding maiden speech. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, for the opportunity to have the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para75"></a>I am an obstetrician but I do not treat patients with infertility; nor have I been involved in research on embryos or gametes. In my capacity as president of the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists, I have responded on behalf of the college to the consultation document, and I draw now upon those comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para76"></a>Application of cloning techniques is divided into those which may provide therapeutic benefit--therapeutic cloning--and those which are designed to create a human being by asexual reproduction--reproductive cloning. In balancing risks and benefits, the potential positive benefits from therapeutic cloning outweigh the foreseeable risks. We should therefore consider taking those risks after the appropriate research has been carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para77"></a>The benefits from human reproductive cloning, however, are not so apparent and the risks are at present unknown. The purpose and intention of cloning for <P>


<a name="column_331"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>purposes of human reproduction are less clear and the advantages cannot be seen to outweigh the disadvantages.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para78"></a>The present Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act allows for restricted research on human embryos of up to 14 days' development provided the embryos are not replaced into a woman's womb. As long as those conditions are met and there is no attempt to continue to grow experimental embryos artificially in vitro beyond 14 days, there are no obvious new ethical issues raised by embryo splitting or nuclear replacement in relation to the special status of the human embryo or what may be done to it within the 14-day period.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para79"></a>The Act allows research of embryos up to 14 days within certain specified areas directly related to reproduction. As has been mentioned by several noble Lords and the noble Baroness, if research into therapeutic cloning is to take place these areas of research may need to be broadened. There is a basic need to discover how embryological cells differentiate, which may be easier using adult nuclei in embryos created by nuclear replacement rather than naturally fertilised embryos alone. Such research, and its potential therapeutic applications, would not raise any new ethical concerns. The use of a cell line developed from an individual's own cell poses less of an ethical and medical dilemma than using tissue from another individual or foetus.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para80"></a>What about issues related to genetics? A right can be defined as a justifiable claim. It is difficult to know how this can be applied to an individual's genetic identity. There is certainly no legal right to one's genetic identity, and it is difficult to argue that there is a moral right. Genetic identity is a gift. It is no more a right than characteristics such as colour of hair or eyes. All humans should be treated as individuals in their own right and not used to gratify another's wishes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para81"></a>However, reproductive cloning is unlikely to produce identical individuals because of differing effects of the environment, as already mentioned. Embryo splitting is more likely to result in similar individuals but nuclear replacement with adult nuclei would create a person of a different age, subject to different environmental pressures, from that of the individual who has donated the nucleus. The creation of a clone of a human person at present is unethical because the reasons in favour of it are limited and too little is known of the consequences; not simply because cloning is unethical per se.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para82"></a>The lack of knowledge of the risks involved in human reproductive cloning makes it unethical at present. The high risk of failure is no reason for not attempting a new technique as long as the subject understands and accepts those risks. Nuclear replacement could involve super-ovulation induction, with the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation to the egg donor, but risks to the clone are largely unknown.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para83"></a>In concluding, there is a general concern that any form of reproductive cloning in humans should be permitted. Thus any use of cloning and related techniques for reproductive purposes, persuasive <P>


<a name="column_332"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examples of which are also given in the document mentioned, must stop short of implantation: that is, the replacement of the cloned embryo into the uterus. Embryo research and therapeutic cloning for the purpose of developing methods of treatment for mitochondrial diseases and for repairing damaged or diseased cells, tissues and organs are different. Research to provide better understanding of cell differentiation is important before we can develop methods of treatment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para84"></a>I recognise that to many, a clone is a potential human being and the arguments in this respect are similar to those in respect of abortion. But there are many in the population who want us to develop the knowledge to help to treat diseases such as cancer, blood diseases, degenerative diseases and so on. Research into stem cells may lead us to this. Of course, if and when it becomes possible to harvest stem cells from adults and transform them into tissue types, this debate will not be necessary.

<A NAME="90428-05_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, it is an enormous pleasure to me from this side of the House to offer our warm congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, on her maiden speech, which we welcome for its clarity, its knowledge, and if I may so, its charm. We look forward to hearing a great many more speeches from the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para85"></a>Today, thanks to my noble friend Lord Alton, we are debating a subject which could not be more fundamental to the whole of the human race. On this matter there is a wide difference between the views of the scientist and the views of the public. The scientist believes that any and every procedure is justified if it advances treatment or aids knowledge of a disease or a condition, or even if he thinks it might--which is not always so by any manner of means. The public see an ethical and a moral side to this. Broadly they believe that it is wrong to create human beings for the sole purpose of using various parts, either to transplant the material or as a means of experimentation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para86"></a>Scientists justifying cloning seek to blind the public with science. They claim that using the embryo in its early stages is nothing to fuss about: it is only a blob. It is merely a little collection of cells and it fits very nicely into a test tube. All of us in this House listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Winston, had to say. In the first part of his speech he seemed to be telling us that we need not worry because it is not going to happen. He then went on to tell us of the advantages when, or if, it did happen. I must admit there have been times when what the noble Lord has written has rather puzzled me, because in the BMJ in March 1997 he wrote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In human reproduction, cloning techniques could offer prospects to sufferers from intractable infertility."
He was clearly in favour of it. In January 1998 he was rather angry with President Clinton, who had made remarks that were clearly against cloning. The noble Lord said that this was a "knee-jerk" reaction and that cloning technology offered hope to many infertile <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_333"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 333</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>couples. Only four days later, in the Independent he wrote:
<P>
<BR>
"I don't know [if cloning human beings could bring benefits] but I think probably yes."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-05_para87"></a>So it is a little difficult to understand quite where we are going sometimes with this highly technical advice. For instance, the noble Lord said today that one cell could be taken from an embryo without killing it. Surely he should then have gone on to say that the HFEA requires that the remaining embryo is to be killed. Surely that is part of the argument. I find it very difficult to set a time in the development of the miracle which could become a child before which it is quite all right to use it as experimental material and after which it is not.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para88"></a>Of course there is a very strong case for "spare part surgery"--some people will certainly die without it--but to produce a living human being simply to supply the necessary hearts, livers, kidneys, corneas or whatever is needed is morally wrong, and indeed utterly repugnant. Some things are surely sacrosanct, and respect for human life, in spite of what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford said, is one of those things,
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para89"></a>It seems that it would not be against the law to use the same technique which produced Dolly the sheep to produce a human being. The law is very ambivalent about this. We do not quite know what kind of human being that would be except that, if we are to judge from Dolly, it would have all the bits and pieces that surgeons want for transplants. It would have all kinds of other cells as well which could be used for experiments. I am horrified to have heard what my noble friend Lord Alton told us about the make-up of the advisory committee which advises the Government on these matters. Every member of that committee is in favour of cloning.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para90"></a>Such a body cannot give unbiased advice; yet surely this is one subject, above all others, on which we need balanced advice, not biased advice. There are some strong views in this House in favour of the individual and its most basic rights. I believe that the public overwhelmingly share these views. It would be a mockery of Christian ethics and a gross indecency to permit humans to be cloned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-05_para91"></a>To hold that view certainly does not mean that one does not respect and admire the brilliance of doctors and scientists. It does not mean that one has no sympathy for the sick people who need transplants or for women who long to conceive and yet find that they cannot. But to create sub-humans for these purposes would surely be wrong. There are, after all, alternatives to therapeutic cloning. Furthermore, we know that there are many human risks attached to this, which I do not have time to address in this very short speech. The Government have said they are not prepared to allow the cloning of humans, but they will permit the use of cloned embryos as source material for organ transplants. It surprises me that an embryo has organs big enough to transplant. I suppose what happens is that we allow the embryo to go into a test tube where it is developed and fed in some way so that it actually grows the transplant organs. But the mind boggles.

<A NAME="90428-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jakobovits: </B>   My Lords, we are once again indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, for giving us the opportunity to delve into this perhaps most vital--literally, most vital--of all subjects that we could ever hope to discuss.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para0"></a>When the Warnock Committee considered the whole issue of human reproduction in the light of modern scientific and technological advances, it wisely recommended a complete ban on the cloning of human beings. That is the law to the present day, as it was enshrined in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para1"></a>Let me say at once that I am not impressed by the argument so frequently advanced that we are playing God by delving into these mysteries of creation itself. On the contrary, I believe that we as human beings, endowed with a divine soul and intelligence, are meant to use that endowment in the service of mankind, medically or otherwise; and every time we bring human ingenuity to bear on alleviating human suffering, bringing solutions to problems of human reproduction, not only do we not play God, we perform an essential basic duty of man; that is, to be Godlike--imitatio dei.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para2"></a>The specific reference to human cloning may call for some fresh consideration and elucidation, especially in the light of the latest scientific and medical developments. In the debate in 1989 when the Bill was passing through your Lordships' House, I suggested that the line drawn between embryos under and over two weeks old--as was mentioned in two contributions here this afternoon--seemed entirely arbitrary. Because the first signs of the so-called "primitive streak" were not apparent before that, it was suggested that, up to two weeks, one should be able to carry out experiments and that thereafter such experiments should cease. Rather, I suggested then that a distinction ought to be made <P>


<a name="column_335"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between embryos generated for experimental purposes, which ought never to be sanctioned, and between embryos that were potentially viable and others which were in any event destined to die.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para3"></a>Let me explain. There was no reason why an excess of embryos which had to be generated in in-vitro fertilisation procedures in order to produce the one or two possible viable births, and which could not afterwards be re-inserted in the mother because it might lead to multiple births and thereby either endanger the mother or the developing foetuses, should not be used for experiments so long as those experiments were designed to lead to possibly life-saving ends. That seems to make a much more logical division that would not infringe or impinge on the dignity and value of human life, potential or otherwise. The whole subject calls for careful re-examination to ensure that human life is adequately protected as well as promoted and that human intelligence is used to remove, as far as we can, human suffering and deprivation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para4"></a>Let me conclude with one important observation that exercises me constantly as a recipient of an age-old tradition in the pioneering of the moral law and the tremendous infinite esteem for human life that we cherish and wish to share with the rest of the human family. These are subjects that are still far too delicate and weighty and, as we have seen in this debate already, too controversial to warrant a definitive ruling, decision or vote at this early stage--early both scientifically and morally.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para5"></a>Therefore, what is called for is a further moratorium, as President Clinton advocated not so long ago, before we take steps that cannot be reversed which could lead to incalculable disaster. If we make one slight miscalculation, we may produce monsters over the generations that cannot be undone. Therefore, caution is the order of the day. But let us not forget that our ultimate assignment is to bring healing on the one hand and the supreme dignity of man and his reproduction on the other to bear on us as humans in maintaining a divine order; a human order that will preserve the distinctiveness and uniqueness of our task as men and women made in the image of our creator.

I read the Gospels every day and many times Jesus Christ says, "As it is written". I need someone to tell me, and I will come back one day to the noble Lord and ask him, "Where is it written? Where were these famous pronouncements made in the Old Testament?".
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para6"></a>Be that as it may. I usually try to speak--as others do in this Chamber--on subjects to which one has devoted a certain amount of prolonged attention. But one cannot always do that. Sometimes one feels so strongly about a matter that, without having been any kind of expert, one must offer one's conviction. I have no difficulty in offering my conviction in relation to human cloning.

<A NAME = "90428-06_para7"></a>I have studied this subject enough recently to be aware that under human cloning human beings will be produced without a father being involved in the reproduction process. There will be no man in the picture; in other words, it will be the end of marriage and of family life. That is the direction in which the cloning of human beings would take us. The idea is revolting to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para8"></a>These are the ideas of high-minded people, one of whom has just left the Chamber. Such high-minded people are responsible for science, but we must not let our scientists determine our morals. Very often they are as moral as we are; but their science points in one direction and, although morals may sometimes point in the same direction, on other occasions they may not. As far as I am concerned, the moral conclusion must come first. The cloning of human beings might mean the end of family life and of marriage. I detest that thought and I hope that the proposition will be rejected on every possible ground.

<A NAME="90428-06_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Perth: </B>   My Lords, first, like many other speakers, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for tabling this Motion. Secondly, I should like to say that I am always happy to follow the noble Earl, Lord Longford, because I find that he and I so often think the same way. The noble Earl puts it more succinctly than I do and manages to be much shorter. Therefore, I shall try to keep an eye on the clock.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para9"></a>Cloning was not a subject to which I had given very much thought. It seemed to me that although the scientists and the doctors were experimenting and working on the subject, it was likely to be a matter for the coming generations--and not us--to think about moral issues and, generally, about what should be done. Then there came a great shock. I have in mind Dolly. I suddenly realised then that we face the moral issues as regards what might be possible now rather than the future generations. When it could apply to humans, it is a tremendous worry; and we are today debating this very subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para10"></a>If the Western world, the Jewish world and the Christian world were all of a mind--indeed, I thought that they were, but I am less certain after having listened to some of today's debate--it would good if they were to take a stand and say that, for them, it was out of the question to have human cloning. I was encouraged by hearing that Europe, save for two nations, had so subscribed. I think that it would be a great idea if the British Government could participate in this process with the rest of Europe. We should make it clear that we are firmly behind everyone else in the sense of supporting their decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para11"></a>It would be ideal if we could get world opinion together on the matter; in, for example, a United Nations motion. However, I suppose that that is wishing for the impossible. Nevertheless, it is worth a try. After all, if we have got it for Europe, we have already gone some way towards achieving agreement with the rest of the world.

<A NAME = "90428-06_para12"></a>I want to make two particular points. The first is my belief that we should never forget that the human being consists of a body and a soul. The human embryo, as Professor T. F. Torrance puts it, is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an embodied soul and a besouled body".
His pamphlet, The Soul and Person of the Unborn Child, published by the Scottish Order of Christian Unity, is invaluable on that point and should be read by all who care about such matters. The poem at the end of the pamphlet is both tragic and unforgettable.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-06_para13"></a>My second point relates to pain and the unborn foetus. For many years, the Women and Children's Welfare Fund and many other organisations have been at great pains to establish this fact against much opinion. Recently-- I mean two or three years ago--there was a great change in attitudes and I believe that it is now well established that the human foetus can feel pain. Indeed, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued a statement to this effect saying that, at any rate after 26 weeks, one must do all that is possible to avoid causing the unborn pain. That is a great advance, which took many seminars and much publicity in the press to achieve. Indeed, pain is something which has been worried about a great deal in relation to experimentation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para14"></a>I conclude by saying that I believe that what we decide will be the most momentous and frightening decision that any government could face. It is not a party matter, but its implications can be very near to acts of God. Indeed, I remember what the noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, said in this connection. However, I repeat: I think that the Government must go very slowly as regards making any change to the present law. This whole subject needs far more debate with the public, with the Churches and with the media than it has been given. I only hope that that debate will take place before any change in the governing rules is allowed.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on introducing today's debate. I have always admired him and have, in the main, always agreed with his expertise on all matters concerned with these human embryology issues. I know that there is no general agreement in the debate, either here or elsewhere. Indeed, one speaker has already quoted the differences of opinion expressed by my noble friend Lord Winston who, unfortunately, has left the Chamber. However, in the past my noble friend has varied his own opinions about whether or not this was a good idea. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, instanced one or two of his different views. So this is a very complicated subject on which, probably, none of us has firm and fixed views.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para15"></a> I believe it was my noble friend Lord Winston who brought God into the issue. He said that God gave us the brains, the intelligence, and so on, and that we must use them. However, God also laid down a set of rules that we ought to be bearing in mind. He did not say that we could do what we like; indeed, the scriptures do not go that far. There are rules if you accept the scriptures and accept God as the supreme being. If one accepts those things, one also accepts that there are rules. One <P>


<a name="column_338"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not say, "We shall accept that bit but we shall make up our own rules as we go along because God has taught us how to think". That is not how I see the matter. I am simple-minded in this respect. I accept the scriptures and I try to obey them every day. I certainly accept God's will. I do not accept that because God has given us a brain we are entitled to abuse that privilege.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para16"></a>I am not a scientist, as noble Lords will have guessed. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, said that there is a line here which should not be crossed. I could not agree more. If there ever was a line, we have almost reached it. That line should not be crossed. We should not even discuss crossing that line in the way that some people are doing as if different circumstances apply in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para17"></a>I have always taken a keen interest in scientific activities and achievements, of which there are many. I could not enumerate them now. However, this short debate is about cloning. When I first read about the experiments and possibilities in this area in the wake of the cloned sheep that has already been mentioned, my first reaction was one of repugnance. I know that many thousands of people feel that repugnance. That has been revealed in a number of articles and in a poll carried out by the Daily Telegraph just before Christmas. Many people have expressed their opposition to these activities. This has been nicknamed the "yuk" reaction, as when people first hear of this matter their reaction is to say, "yuk". They cannot imagine who has dreamt up such a policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para18"></a>The "yuk" factor is not evidence of an unreasoned reaction. Feelings of repugnance are sometimes an appropriate moral response. We cannot assume that such feelings will lessen upon mature reflection. Two of the leading philosophers of British enlightenment, David Hume and Adam Smith, believed that ethical judgment is rooted in human moral sentiments such as repugnance. There is an argument for and against everything, but what we are witnessing are further signs of public disquiet and repugnance. Scientists should have learnt a lesson from the reaction to genetically modified foods. It was said initially that that was simply a case of the "yuk" factor and that public sentiment would settle down. However, it has not settled down and scientists are having to accept that fact. I suggest that public repugnance will be expressed ever more strongly if the activities we are discussing go ahead. I do not know of anyone who can even contemplate the prospect of creating babies in this way. People always ask about the psychological effects on children who are created in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para19"></a>Those who took part in the poll that I have just mentioned thought that it was unnatural and dangerously self-centred to want to produce a child that was a perfect copy of either the mother or the father. Although such procedures are not yet possible, and would be illegal, some researchers believe that human cloning may be only a few years away. That must frighten all of us. I hope that when my noble friend replies to the debate she will tell us why there has not been a proper parliamentary debate on this matter. Why does it appear that we cannot have an impartial debate on this matter on any television station? A number of debates have taken place but they have all been rigged. No opposing <P>


<a name="column_339"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>point of view has been submitted. The participants in the debates have all been scientists or doctors, or people who have a vested interest in promoting this subject, as is the case with people who support GM foods. Those vested interests have caused many problems. I hope that my noble friend will be able to give us some hope that the Government take a positive view on this matter. That positive view should be that the Government object to and oppose cloning for any purpose.

<A NAME="90428-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ryder of Warsaw: </B>   My Lords, we have now reached 28th April 1999. Who would have imagined--I include myself in this, especially because during the war I served with the highly secret Polish Section of Special Forces (SOE)--that we would be told on the Floor of your Lordships' House about the idea or desire to use human embryos for cloning? This, most sadly, is a proof of our semi-pagan society.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para20"></a>Assurances were given by the then government in 1990 that IVF would be used only for the benefit of infertile couples. Now, IVF is being used for "social" reasons, for example, to allow career women to choose when they want to have their children. We must therefore be extremely suspicious of current proposals that the use of cloning technology will remain under the strictest scrutiny. Frankly, that is just waffle.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para21"></a>The sanctity of marriage and the sacrament of God giving children drifts further and further away from the minds of millions--such, alas, is Britain today. As Christians and believers--and always remembering our Jewish friends--we should express our total shock about that which is against God's law. As a Catholic, I am appalled by these proposals. I also try to represent Poland, where the government, Church and people are horrified to hear what is happening here.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para22"></a>I was witness to what the Germans carried out in the majority of over 7,000 death and concentration camps all over Europe where every variety of experiment, including human cloning, was carried out on people of over 40 nationalities and of all age groups. I believe that those of us who fought in the war realised we were fighting evil in all its worst forms. We did not fight to defeat all the evil deeds of the whole Nazi system between 1933 and 1945 only to sanction, over 50 years later, equal evil to be taxed on humanity in what used to be our proud and united country of Britain. To quote Edmund Burke,

<A NAME="90428-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ashbourne: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for introducing this debate before the Government respond to the review of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority entitled, Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine.
<P>


<a name="column_340"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para23"></a>This review concluded that human reproductive cloning should not be allowed, in line with widespread concern about such a possibility. This would mean that no cloned human baby, child or adult could be created. However, the review recommended that the Government should permit the creation of cloned human embryos by nuclear transfer in order to develop and grow stem cells to produce tissues and cells for transplantation. This would require an amendment to the current law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para24"></a>Those in favour of using embryos argue that it will bring medical benefits such as the possibility of more successful transplants. However, the fact that there seem to be beneficial possibilities to a programme of research does not in itself justify that programme. Given how controversial the whole area of embryo research remains, both in this country and worldwide, it seems surprising that the review did not consider the ethical concerns arising from the creation, manipulation and destruction of cloned human embryos in order to use their cells in other humans. Such use inevitably raises afresh questions about the status of the embryo and the use to which an embryo can be put in scientific research.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para25"></a>Like many others, I believe that life begins at conception. Even those who do not hold that view will generally acknowledge that human embryos have a special status and should not be misused in any way, particularly on the scale necessary for this research. The deliberate destruction of hundreds of thousands more human embryos at 14 days does not seem consistent with the view expressed in the Warnock Report that the,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"embryo of the human species ought to have a special status".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-06_para26"></a>In 1975 the Declaration of Helsinki embodied these words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject".
It continued:
<P>
<BR>
"The doctor can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research is justified by its potential diagnostic and therapeutic value for the patient".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-06_para27"></a>In conclusion, there are significant issues at stake which have not been fully or widely considered and debated. Once human cloning of any type or for any purpose is allowed, it will be very difficult, probably impossible, to recall it. So, while there still remains a technological barrier to the creation of human cloned embryos, I believe that there is a need to fully debate and consider the ethical issues, and the implications inherent in allowing their creation, before heading down the path of human cloning of any kind whatever.

I fully support the role of the HFEA and the way it has proceeded in regulating the Act. I hope that it is now fully clear to the House that if we accept, or had accepted, the fundamentalist position of the noble Lord, Lord Alton--certainly in relation to the 14-day period--none of the benefits of the 1990 Act would have followed.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para28"></a>I am sure that at that time, just as now, the noble Lord was raising the argument that this was the thin end of the wedge. Today we have had, as expected, the "slippery slope" argument, which is right when it is used in the proper context, but it has to be judged in the context under discussion. I have been trying to work out how many of the noble Lord's supporters in the debate today are like-minded and believe that we still should not be able to use the 14-day period specified in the Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para29"></a>Perhaps I may reminisce for a moment. I well remember the seminal key debate in the House at the Committee stage of the 1990 Bill, when there was a free vote according to conscience. The House, in its wisdom, voted by a massive majority of about three to one--the figures were 234 to 80--in favour of keeping the Bill as it was. Obviously, a clear majority was obtained in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para30"></a>In that debate, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, made a key speech, which was extremely influential in this Chamber. I am sorry that he is not able to be here today. He is, unfortunately, on a lecture tour in Canada. The noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, was most instrumental in assembling the support on our side of the debate in that Bill. I know that he would have liked to have spoken in the debate, but unfortunately he is not able to be present today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para31"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked for a clear line to be drawn. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford said that we had drawn a line at 14 days. That is what happened in the House in 1990. I am surprised that we are still continuing to debate the matter in the way that we are. Obviously, we are allowed to revisit old arguments, but the argument was decided then. I see no reason to change the fundamental 14-day period which, in my opinion, has worked very well. I approved of the other points in the speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford when he talked about the prodigality of nature and using the environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para32"></a>The steps taken by the HFEA are the best that we can take. We are talking about what we can do in this country. We have raised the spectre of what happens in America, Mexico and Korea, but we are trying to approve a suitable regulatory framework which can control what happens in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para33"></a>The noble Lord raised the matter of what has been approved under the Council of Europe protocol. He has made quite an issue of it in the Questions he has put down for Written Answer. I am sure that the Minister will tell us the answer, which is very simple and does not reflect on the Government. We have not signed the protocol to the treaty referred to. One simply cannot sign a protocol to a treaty unless one signs the treaty itself. The reason we have not signed the treaty has nothing to do with human cloning and therefore the remarks about the speech of President Chirac are, in my opinion, completely irrelevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para34"></a>The provisions in the original Act have operated well. The two recommendations now before us in the report--to establish procedures which could not have been anticipated at the time--are, after nine years, a reasonable step forward. I find the report well balanced <P>


<a name="column_342"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and moderate. The recommendation that there should be another review in five years' time is not the uncontrolled haste in this field that some people are warning against. The report has clearly and fairly placed before us the possibility of putting the banning of human cloning into primary legislation. It is clear that the Government and the HFEA are against that. All the spectres raised today, which are designed to worry us about what might happen, are very much dreams and ideas for the future. We must concentrate on the immediate years to come.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para35"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked for a proper debate on this subject. I am not sure that the debate today has been the measured and reasoned debate that I should like. Following the Government's response to the HFEA and HGAC report, I understand that there is nothing to stop a debate taking place in the House. I am sure that there will be a debate in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para36"></a>Finally, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that it is not helpful to a reasoned debate in Parliament to raise the spectres of "sub-species of human clones" and "nightmare kingdoms". It does not help to raise by association a farrago of fears about Dolly, goats, and abortion. We have a regulatory system--we are very lucky to have it--through the HFEA. We are making slow progress by slow steps. I hope that that progress will continue.

<A NAME="90428-06_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, the subject of this debate is truly fascinating, involving as it does issues of scientific ethics, religion and morality, human health and the nature of the human person, and the requirement for legislation and government action. I am genuinely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for bringing forward the debate, even though I disagree with much of what he said. It has been a struggle for me to understand the subject of the debate. But the effort has been rewarding and it does us all good to be obliged to think seriously about such issues. I join other noble Lords in welcoming to the Chamber the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve, who made a most distinguished, balanced and calm contribution to the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para37"></a>The remote possibility that humans could be cloned is a typically contemporary issue. Throughout history, "modern thinking" or "science" has challenged accepted truths. The problem in our time is that so many things are changing so fast. The press carries news of potential change, often less than accurately, to every citizen. So criticism of new scientific developments, particularly when they seem to upset not just the settled human order, but the "natural order" itself, is more acute and more widespread than in earlier ages.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para38"></a>Reading the briefings and listening to the debate, the basis for non-acceptance of, or doubts about, human cloning seem to fall into several categories. The approach that it is immoral to take on God's powers or that interference with nature is unacceptable may well be stimulated by comments such as those of Julian <P>


<a name="column_343"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Savulescu of the ethics unit, The Murdoch Institute for Genetic Research, Melbourne, who said recently:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Some people think that human zygotes are special because they have the potential to create people. Cloning has shattered that belief. There is no morally significant difference between a fertilised egg in a petri dish in an IVF clinic ... a cloned cell, and a skin cell: they could all be persons, with the application of modern technology".
That statement can be turned entirely upside down to support the position of the noble Lord, Lord Alton.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-06_para39"></a>There is the fear of the effect cloning could have on the status of the cloned infant or on society at large. The noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, spoke convincingly on that issue. There are doubts about the safety of the technology. There are accusations that cloning could become a source of profit for a few large pharmaceutical companies and that it is being pushed forward by them for that purpose and possibly with inappropriate speed. There are accusations that the whole fertility/cloning area of medicine is just one more example of dominant male science trying to control women's reproductive processes. There are arguments that the techniques of cloning do not offer the only route to more effective therapies and could be more difficult and more expensive than the development of cell culture of neural brain or bone marrow stem cells.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para40"></a>I am a politician and not a moral philosopher or a scientist. Like many others, including the Liberal Democrat working party currently debating these issues, I am hard-pressed to decide on the merits of these arguments. What is more, in a 10-minute speech, I do not have time. I will just say, however, that my sympathies lie rather with the noble Lord, Lord Winston, and the right reverend Prelate than with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, or the noble Baronesses, Lady Blatch and Lady Ryder of Warsaw. In any case what is quite clear is that these arguments give cause for government and legislators to proceed with great caution. Furthermore, history teaches us that the law-making process cannot outrun or lag behind the accepted ethic of the day by too large a margin without causing some level of unrest. Today public opinion is unmistakably opposed to the creation of cloned human beings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para41"></a>Finally, it seems clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, also reminded us, that cloning of animals is accompanied by a very high risk of foetal abnormalities and perinatal mortality. One might say that this renders the process of cloning unacceptable for animals, let alone for human beings. It is in this area that doubts about the motivation of those who are pushing this technology seem most justifiable. The history of the introduction of GM foods gives a vivid example of the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para42"></a>The Government have responded by resolutely setting their face against the creation of full human clones, as a number of recent Answers to the Questions of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, have indicated. The noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, gave other instances of the current policy background to this subject. But if today we reject full cloning of human beings, other options for progressing beyond what is permitted under current legislation exist, options which may or may not be seen as acceptable. That, I believe, is the distinction which the noble Lord, Lord Winston, made earlier.

<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para43"></a>First, there is the culture of cloned cells to provide tissue, such as bone marrow, for patients whose bodies would not reject the tissue because it would be genetically identical to their own. Secondly, there is the transfer of a cell nucleus from one woman's egg to another and its subsequent fertilisation by the intended father's sperm for the purpose of avoiding the transmission from the woman to her offspring of mitochondrial disease. The joint report of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority recommend that these two procedures should be added to the list of subjects, research into which is permitted by the 1990 Act. Their view is that all of this could be done by regulation under the Act. I therefore wish to ask the Minister: when do the Government anticipate responding to that report? Are the Government minded to accept that recommendation?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para44"></a>The question also arises as to other actions the Government should now take in the light of the report itself and of the rapid technological change and public ignorance of that change which in part prompted it. In an interesting article in The Times Educational Supplement of 2nd April this year, the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, whose status in this subject is unimpeachable, broadly supported the suggestion of the establishment of a Royal Commission to study and report back on issues connected with genetic engineering in general. The body could also publish its reports, the minutes of its meetings and the evidence submitted to it. But, sadly, she clearly had doubts about the possibility of such a body today being completely independent or being listened to with respect and confidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para45"></a>In the closing sentences of her article the noble Baroness suggested that the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which is due to publish its report on GM foods in May, could be kept in being as a permanent commission to examine genetic issues as they arise. Such a commission could help to remedy the state of unreadiness to face these issues, to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred in his speech, by monitoring and evaluating the rapid changes in technology which are part of the problem. It could provide a rational, detached source of information to government and public alike. It could assess the risk of genetic technology becoming the private property of individual companies and of such companies driving the law ahead of popular consent in the search for profits, as is the case with GM foods. Have the Government given serious thought to this kind of permanent body and, if so, what are their conclusions?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para46"></a>We have had a long and interesting debate. Some noble Lords took more than their time. I am very willing to sit down with one minute of mine unexpired.

<a name="column_345"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issues arising from the matters that the noble Lord has raised are as complex as they are deep. Yet even amidst a calm and measured discussion such as ours this afternoon, it is all too apparent how divergent views can be and how closely interwoven are the three underlying components of ethical principle, reason and emotion. That is significant when we come to realise that parliamentary debate, invaluable as it may be, is not on its own able to provide a sufficiently robust foundation for government decision-making in a matter such as this. The other vital precondition is surely to have a good measure of public consensus.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para48"></a>If I am conscious of one thing about this particular ethical issue, it is that in many respects it is a new one, and that the public debate, which is only just beginning, has been outpaced by the progress of the science. As we have seen all too clearly with the issue of genetically modified foods, that situation is always a worrying one. Although a good deal of the press coverage on cloning that I have seen has been balanced and informed, at the same time we can discern from some of the language that is used that, if we are not careful, scope exists for over-simplification and the kind of public debate that we decidedly do not want; namely, the kind of media treatment that moves in short order from rational argument to unreasoning hysteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para49"></a>So, informing the public is as important as listening to them. The process must not be unduly rushed. In other words, we want to avoid a situation in which the public feel that the pace of the agenda is being driven by impatient commercial interests. That situation is almost guaranteed to induce a knee-jerk reaction, not a considered one.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para50"></a>That said, the main and very clear message that has emerged from public consultation to date is that so-called reproductive cloning is anathema to most people. The report published last December by the HGAC and the HFEA set out the arguments clearly. The most compelling of those centre around the unacceptability of seeking to create a human being without the interests of that person being uppermost. The other, quite different, issue is that nuclear replacement carries a high risk of congenital malformation and miscarriage. The Government have already said clearly that the legalisation of human cloning for reproductive purposes is not to be countenanced, and I wholeheartedly endorse that position.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para51"></a>The debate therefore centres on whether cloning experiments should be permitted under strictly controlled conditions with a view to establishing what benefits the technique may bring to the treatment of disease. In that context, let me say without further ado that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on a number of matters. I agree that simply because there is widespread agreement about the need to prohibit reproductive human cloning, that is no reason for us to adopt an unquestioning approach to the morality of what is known as CNR--the replacement of a cell nucleus--for therapeutic purposes. The word "therapeutic" must not distract us. The ethical case for CNR has to be made. I am very far from clear that that case was made by the HGAC and HFEA in their report.
<P>


<a name="column_346"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para52"></a>I also profoundly agree with the noble Lord that moral values which espouse the sanctity of all human life should not be overridden in the name of expediency or the inexorable march of science. Those who proclaim such values uphold the best and most precious features of a civilised society, and if we depart from them, we must never do so lightly. Now, in the same breath, we also need to recognise that although many individuals adhere in their personal lives to a code of moral absolutes--or try to, our legal system, in so far as it attempts to balance different interests in society, cannot do that. Yet even a code founded on moral relativism ought to take as a starting-point that amidst the sometimes conflicting values of a society, certain values, such as the inherent worth of a human individual, should enjoy a status that is pre-eminent.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para53"></a>But if our aim is to inform the public, one of the issues about which we ought to be clear is the need to distinguish between the separate strands of what might be termed the "ethical backdrop". One strand is the issue of cloning; another is the issue of using human embryos for the purpose of research. If, like the noble Lord, Lord Alton, you believe that the use of embryos for scientific experiments is unacceptable on absolute moral grounds, you are not likely to be persuaded that the use of a cloned embryo is any the less repugnant, whatever its intended purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para54"></a>Nevertheless, the strands need to be separated. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 established, as a result of decisive parliamentary majorities in both Houses, that there were limited sets of circumstances when research on the human embryo up to 14 days was permissible. That decision may not be to the liking of everyone. There is, indeed, a case for asking Parliament to revisit such legislation at intervals to ensure that it still holds good. But I respectfully suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that it was not illogical or irresponsible of the joint committee of the HGAC/HFEA to have examined the issue of cloning as a discrete matter within the context of the existing law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para55"></a>One criticism advanced against the current proposal for therapeutic cloning is that it treats the creation of an embryo as a means to an end and not an end in itself. But, like it or not, that is what the law already allows. The purpose proposed is indeed new; but I suggest that the moral Rubicon of embryo usage is one that has already been crossed. The point at issue, therefore, is whether the intended purpose is ethically acceptable or not, and whether cloning, per se, presents us with a real moral difficulty.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para56"></a>To take the second of those issues first, I have heard no argument that convinces me that replicating the genome of a living individual is of itself a morally dubious course of action. However, I am of course open-minded on this. As to the new intended purpose of embryo usage, I am hesitant. That there may be medical benefits in prospect, albeit some way down the road, I have little doubt. What I am not clear about, however, is whether the claims that are made are well founded, or whether experiments involving human cloning provide the only possible route to securing those benefits. If they do, the proposal deserves a fair and dispassionate hearing. If they do not, and there is an alternative on the <P>


<a name="column_347"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>horizon, as some reports suggest there is, I do not think that the case has been made. We ought to start from the position that if research using embryos can be avoided, we have a moral duty to avoid it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para57"></a>So I come back to the point at which I started. Science should be accountable to the public for what it does. In my view, the Warnock report was well handled by the previous government; it was allowed to gestate and gain support before any attempt was made to legislate. The same process is needed here. Parliamentarians should not propose to crystallise the issue in statute or regulation without deep reflection or in isolation from informed public opinion. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for providing the opportunity to debate these issues. There was a widespread view when the noble Lord recently asked a Starred Question on the subject that such a debate should take place. The debate provoked by the noble Lord has been wide-ranging, well-informed and deeply felt. We have heard a wide variety of views, ranging from ethical nightmares to scientific dreams--sometimes posing false dichotomies between the two. None of the contributions has lacked understanding of the need for respect for the issues of human dignity that are entailed in these considerations, or the need for the ethical debate to keep pace with the scientific debate when we make far-reaching decisions in these areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para58"></a>We have also had contributions that, in the noble Lord's terminology, have been both clever and wise. One was the very distinguished maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve. She brought to this debate particular knowledge and expertise, not least from her role as a member and now acting chair of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission. I am sure that everyone in this House welcomes the noble Baroness and her contribution today. Perhaps those of us who are alumnae of Newnham take particular pleasure in having the principal of their old college as a Member of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para59"></a>When considering these issues it is important to do so in the broadest of contexts, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. We should also do so without any unnecessary stereotyping or assumption that scientists have no sense of responsibility of the enormity of some of the ethical dilemmas produced by their creativity. The need to welcome and celebrate what science can achieve was very well described by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford. The noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, also reminded us of the duty to explore creativity and potential advances that contribute to human wellbeing. We should not assume that scientific advances are necessarily bad, any more than we should assume that simply because something can be done it should be done or that the implications in the widest social, moral and ethical setting should not be well considered.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para60"></a>I hope, therefore, that noble Lords will understand if I do not answer the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. The noble Baroness asked what the Government were minded to do in this area. There were enough calls this afternoon for a wide-ranging and well considered debate to indicate that the Government should move very carefully and slowly in response to the recommendations of the report. I should like to take the comments made in your Lordships' House and feed them into the consideration of the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para61"></a>I have also taken careful note of the calls by the Benches opposite and my noble friend Lord Stallard for a debate in another place on these issues. However, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was quite right to suggest that it is not only in Parliament that these issues need to be debated. I shall certainly pass on those comments to the business managers in another place. I am not responsible for business management in another place; nor am I responsible for the editorial policy of television companies as to the coverage that they give to these issues. However, those who have suggested that we would all benefit from a well informed public in these areas are absolutely right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para62"></a>Before I turn to the question of cloning, like other noble Lords perhaps I may set the scene in respect of embryo research generally. Many who have spoken today are clearly familiar with the workings of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. However, it bears repeating because there may be some misunderstanding about the extent to which the Act controls the use of human embryos in infertility treatment and research. These issues were first considered by the committee led by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, to whom tributes have been paid today. That committee reported in 1984. Following considerable public consultation, that committee concluded that embryo research should be permitted subject to strict safeguards, not least that such research should be limited to very early embryos; that is, only up to the 14th day after fertilisation. As has been pointed out, after further public consultation by the then government the majority of the report's recommendations were introduced into Parliament, debated at considerable length and approved in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para63"></a>Some noble Lords have put forward the "slippery slope" argument and said that we should not embark on any of these issues at all. Perhaps I should declare an interest. I first became involved in consideration of these ethical issues when the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists set up an ethics committee to consider what its response should be to the Warnock Committee, on which I served as a lay member. Certainly, the "slippery slope" argument was put forward then. When one is on a slippery slope perhaps one should have some strong, trusty and reliable boots. Those boots may take the form of a moral and ethical framework in which one considers the issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para64"></a>The framework created by the 1990 Act is very well respected and has made the United Kingdom one of the world leaders, having the most comprehensive regulation and oversight of developments in these areas. It is also one in which the benefits that we have seen <P>


<a name="column_349"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 349</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have not been accompanied by some of the worst fears as to what may happen. Although I respect the view of some noble Lords that ab initio the recommendations were not correct and breached an ethical and moral rule with which they were not comfortable, in the main the Act has been considered to work very well.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-06_para65"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Longford that between 1991 and 1997 27,777 children were born as a result of IVF techniques. That has been a very considerable contribution to strengthening the family and marriage and is one that we should not undervalue in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-07_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend deny that if cloning proceeds it is possible to have children without fathers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, very soon I shall turn to the position of the Government on reproductive cloning which is very much the same as that of my noble friend; namely, that we do not envisage that possibility or find it ethically acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para0"></a>Perhaps I may refer to the suggested profligacy in the use of embryos, particularly very early ones. Of the total of just over 600,000 embryos created in the six years between 1991 and March 1997, which is the latest date for which verified figures are available, nearly half have been used in treatment; one-quarter stored for future treatment and some 43,000 used in research. Therefore, we are not talking about hundreds of thousands of wasted embryos.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para1"></a>Much of the debate today has centred on the joint Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and Human Genetics Advisory Commission report Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine. The Government received that report in December last year and are considering its recommendations. Perhaps I may seek to clarify what we mean when we talk about human cloning. Human reproductive cloning would involve the birth of a baby who had an identical genetic makeup to another individual, which is the situation to which my noble friend refers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Stallard asked for a clear statement as to where the Government stand on such techniques. I can give him that. It has been made clear in another place and in your Lordships' House, but I make no apology for repeating what we have said before. Our position on human reproductive cloning remains firmly that such cloning is ethically unacceptable and will not be permitted within the United Kingdom. There is recognition of this in the joint HFEA/HGAC report, and the public support given in response to the consultation on that report demonstrated that public consensus to which the noble Earl referred. There is no ambiguity in the Government's position.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para3"></a>I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, of that lack of ambiguity. Nothing sinister should be inferred from the fact that we have not signed the cloning protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. Perhaps I may add to what the noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, said on this point. The Government played an active role in the development of this protocol, which was opened for <P>


<a name="column_350"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 350</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>signature on 12th January 1998, and we fully support the principle it enshrines. However, a member state of the Council of Europe can sign a protocol only if it has previously signed the relevant convention under which the protocol was developed. In this case that is the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. That convention contains a wide range of complex ethical and legal provisions. In particular, the provisions on research on persons not able to give consent have aroused some public concern. As noble Lords will be aware, the Government have therefore undertaken a wide public consultation on these provisions as part of the wider consultation on decision-making for people who are mentally incapacitated.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para4"></a>We have to consider the responses to this consultation before we can address the question of signing the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. But that is the reason for that position rather than any issue on cloning. As the noble Earl, Lord Perth, suggested, a broader international community beyond Europe is also addressing the issue of human cloning. In November 1997 the member states of UNESCO unanimously agreed the declaration of human rights and the human genome which includes a prohibition on human reproductive cloning. I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para5"></a>I wish also to reassure him that there is nothing sinister in the fact that the report was placed in the Library of the House, and that, in accordance with usual practice, individual responses to consultation were not placed in the Library. It has been made clear that, in line with normal practice and where respondents have not asked for confidentiality, individual submissions to the consultation may be viewed by arrangement with the HGAC secretariat.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para6"></a>Some doubts have been cast on the membership of the working party which undertook some of the preliminary work for the report. I stress that Ministers make appointments to the bodies fully in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The report is a report of the two bodies, not simply of the working group. If noble Lords look at the lists included in the report, they will note that membership of those bodies represents a wide range of knowledge, background and experience. It brings together people from many different areas, adding expertise to the subject, and ensures transparency in further consultations which take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para7"></a>While I speak of reassurance, reference has been made to an article in the Sunday Times about a doctor who said that he wishes to clone embryos in order to store a back-up embryo to recreate a child to ease the parents' grief in the event of the first child's death. I shall clarify the position. While one form of cloning is specifically banned by the 1990 Act, as regards embryo splitting a licence would be required from the HFEA. The authority has made crystal clear that it will not licence cloning by embryo splitting for treatment purposes. I should make clear that the authority has received no such application, as reported in the Sunday Times.
<P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para8"></a>The recommendations made by the report would require changes to the regulations under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and would require careful consideration. The use of cloning techniques for research into therapy or treatment is a very different issue to that of human reproductive cloning. I have made the position clear on that. These techniques, which involve the replication of individual cells, have long been used in medical research and treatment--for example, in the development and use of vaccines, and for producing skin grafts for burn victims. We would not wish to disturb the long-existing arrangements in medical research and treatment which have brought and continue to bring so many benefits to so many people.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para9"></a>I emphasise that any decision to extend the currently permitted purposes of research involving human embryos requires the most careful consideration. I believe that the tenor of today's debate has been that the Government should not be rushed into giving their response on such a sensitive and wide-ranging issue. The HFEA and HGAC consulted widely before making their recommendations. It is right that we take full account of the views expressed in the course of that consultation. The Government's response will be made in due course. Today's debate has been a timely occasion for Members of your Lordships' House to put their views.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para10"></a>These are exciting times in terms of potential developments in science, technology and medicine. We hear regularly of advances; for example, research into treatments for cancer, heart disease and other serious debilitating illnesses. The human genome project, which is close to completion, offers literally amazing potential for better understanding of the genetic contribution to many diseases and the developments of safer medicines. We must not be carried away on a tide of enthusiasm for what might be and allow it to undermine the basic need for a clear-sighted ethical, moral and social evaluation of the consequences of these potential changes. Neither should we be so frightened that we do not make advances which have enormous potential benefits for medicine and humanity.

<A NAME="90428-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, it is customary for those winding up these short debates to be brief. I intend to abide by that custom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para11"></a>I thank the Minister for her remarks about the debate with which I entirely concur. It has been balanced and measured. It has been a timely contribution to the debate about whether cloning of human beings should be permitted. The noble Baroness said that there should be proper access to, and transparency of, all the arguments. I agree. She will be concerned, as I was, that when my research assistant sought to see the submissions he was told that he could do so only under supervision for a period of two hours and could take written notes but could not photocopy the documents. When I requested that the documents be placed in the Library of your Lordships' House, I was told that that would not be <P>


<a name="column_352"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible. I believe that it should be possible for us to have access to those documents so that we can reach balanced conclusions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para12"></a>I believe also that just as the Government were right recently to replace their advisers on environmental matters because they were seen in the wake of the controversy over GM food to be too close to the industry, they should think carefully also about those who have been advising them on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para13"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will want me to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve, on a magnificent maiden speech. We have a mutual friend who is an academic at St Andrew's University where I am a visiting Fellow. He told me that we could expect erudite contributions from the noble Baroness. We have not been disappointed today. Hers was an authoritative contribution which I know will be weighed by your Lordships. I was especially struck by what she said about the ambiguous and confused heritage which might be the fate of clones were we to proceed down that path. We look forward to her future contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para14"></a>Today, we have heard voices from all parts of the House ranging across many different traditions, ideologies and religions. I was struck by the speeches of my noble friend Lady Ryder of Warsaw; the noble Earls, Lord Longford and Lord Perth; my noble friend Lord Jakobovits and the noble Lord, Lord Stallard. Those voices speak to us out of the din of the hard lessons of the 20th century. They embody wisdom gleaned from this, the bloodiest of centuries. I hope that Members of your Lordships' House who were unable to be present today will read those contributions and ponder their wise advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, told us that we should at all times be prepared to think again and to exercise caution. He called for a moratorium, which I am sure all of us who have spoken today will take to heart and, it is to be hoped, agree with.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashbourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, raised many moral questions embodied in the debate. My noble friend Lady Knight--she is my noble friend for the purpose of these debates--with whom I co-operated in another place on many such issues, has often been vilified for raising them. She was one of 29 who in 1967 voted against the Abortion Act. Four years ago in another place, we worked together when there was an attempt by scientists at the Rosslyn Institute to take embryos from aborted baby girls to use in fertility treatments. What an extraordinary way that would have been to have come into this world if your Lordships and Members of another place had not decided to use the Criminal Justice Bill to outlaw such a proposal. What a way to come into the world, to have an aborted foetus as your mother, her life having been taken by your grandmother. Just because something may be scientifically possible does not make it right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-07_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, who I admire enormously and with whom I am often a combatant on these questions, both here and outside, inevitably disagreed with me today. But that does not diminish my respect for him. Indeed, his is a voice to which people will listen and I hope that he will weigh the awesome <P>


<a name="column_353"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibilities that scientists have in such matters. I am not against science--far from it. I agree with my noble friend Lord Jakobovits that science must be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. It is an important profession. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, accused me of using a blunderbuss and missing my target. He will forgive me if I tease him for sometimes being a moving target. Today he told us that it would not happen, but he has also said that it could happen and be beneficial. In The Times of 24th February 1997, he said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no medical reason for cloning humans and there are obvious risks. I don't think that anyone seriously believes that there would be any benefit to cloning humans".
I agree with that entirely, but in the Independent of Monday 12th January 1998, he said:

<A NAME = "90428-08_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood; the noble Earl, Lord Howe; and the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, speaking from their Front Benches and on behalf of their parties, dealt with great political questions which will be increasingly important to their parties in the future. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford made a speech which I found extremely disappointing. But there are first-class Anglican theologians such as Oliver O'Donovan, Professor Torrance and Michael Banner to whom I would refer him. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, said that cloning human beings would be unethical and carry risks. I agree with him.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath </B>   rose to call attention to the current arrangements for the protection of hedgerows; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to debate an issue which is interesting to many Members of your Lordships' House and to not a few million people concerned about our natural inheritance and landscape. It will give my noble friend Lady Farrington the opportunity to explain the Government's position and to indicate the improvement which must be made to the flawed 1996 hedgerow regulations. It would be useful to have an indication of the Government's thinking on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para5"></a>My interest in conservation and hedgerows extends over a long period. I served as chairman of the Natural Environment Sub-Committee and the Environment Committee of the Council of Europe. I was frequently rapporteur--on one occasion before the Council of Europe Convention on Wildlife and Habitat. I welcome the fact that the Government swiftly acceded to that convention. I was delighted when they sought to put their obligations into practice by the introduction of the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Bill. It was a measure of considerable importance, but it offered no advantage to hedgerows.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para6"></a>Therefore, in 1982, with the invaluable assistance of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and with support from parties across the Commons, I presented the Hedgerows Bill. The Government blocked it and used as their reason their belief that the destruction of hedgerows had virtually ended. That was not so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para7"></a>At about the same time I realised that enclosure awards in South Yorkshire, where I live, usually provided protection for hedgerows in former common land. The South Yorkshire enclosure awards spelt out that the fields formed from the common land should be perpetually surrounded by fences, in most cases fences protected by oak palings. I could see no reason to doubt that that legal perpetual obligation continued to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para8"></a>I was advised by Mr. Colin Seymour, who lived in West Yorkshire and whom I shall mention again, that the same conditions applied there. I found enclosure awards in East Anglia covering thousands of acres. All of them had the requirement that hedgerows or other field boundaries--walls or dykes--had to be maintained forever as an obligation and condition of the possession of the land. I may be accused of making a revolutionary proposal if I say that if the individual who possesses the land breaches the conditions on which that possession is based it might not be a bad idea to suggest that he should lose possession. However, perhaps your Lordships would not go quite so far as that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para9"></a>When I realised that such protective arrangements were relatively comprehensive, I wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for confirmation that the law still existed. I suggested that substantial sums of taxpayers' money might have been spent on grants to encourage grubbing out of hedgerows. I suggested too that the Ministry had taken no steps to ensure that grant <P>


<a name="column_355"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was not paid where the hedgerow was required to be perpetually maintained. The response was that if that had happened the Ministry would have to recover the grants that had been paid. I do not think any such grants were recovered.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para10"></a>However, one continued to press for progress. The Government made it clear in the following years that they did not want another Bill, but in 1987 I received some encouragement. At that time I was serving on the Council of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It was celebrating its centenary. The celebration commenced at King's Cross Station, where the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, as Prime Minister, was the guest speaker. It was an important occasion for the RSPB, a very large body with more members than all the political parties in England put together.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para11"></a>I was not an enthusiastic fan of the then Prime Minister. I was delighted, however, that she made a splendid speech calling specifically and clearly for the protection of hedgerows and urging us to act as guardians and trustees of our natural heritage. It was a slight disappointment to me that I could not join in the rest of the celebrations. I was on my way to the House of Commons to present the 1987 Hedgerows Bill, which met the wishes passed to me of the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners' Association. I amended the 1982 Bill to meet their requirement that they should have the right to demolish part of a hedgerow for reasons of access. That seemed to me entirely reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para12"></a>The Bill was supported across the Floor of the House, but on the Friday when we hoped to secure Second Reading it was blocked. I do not blame the Government Whips who blocked it; they were doing their job having been ordered to do so by the Government and by No. 10, Downing Street. The noble Baroness said, in some rather acrimonious correspondence, that the Government had other things to think of as well as conservation. Some of us have been thinking of conservation since then, as we did before.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para13"></a>I suggested that the national conservation bodies should seek to pursue the matter by bringing a test case to protect the enclosure hedgerows, but they were very slow to do so. However, our Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, a splendid regional trust, maintained a keen interest and protected hedgerows in some areas under threat. In some instances it was successful in stopping destruction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para14"></a>Mr. Colin Seymour, who by then had moved to Flamborough, raised the proposed destruction of an enclosure hedgerow by Flamborough Parish Council. With the support of our trust and my own express support, the matter proceeded to court in 1996. The court accepted that the case was good. I advised the Government, who were then preparing the hedgerow regulations in fulfilment of a clear 1992 manifesto promise, that it would be wise for them to ensure that nothing in the regulations would embarrass or imperil the decisions that might accrue from the Flamborough judgment or indeed any other.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para15"></a>But the Government went ahead and inserted into the regulations the words, "important hedgerow". The enclosure awards covering virtually the whole of <P>


<a name="column_356"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lowland England did not differentiate between one kind of field boundary and another, and the law did not say that the perpetual obligation was only for those hedgerows that someone might think important. It said that that protection was absolute and perpetual. The phrase "important hedgerow" requires subjective judgments from all kinds of people who may be in permanent disagreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para16"></a>The regulations placed local authorities in an impossible position. If someone wishes to pull down a hedgerow the local authority in effect has four weeks to carry out a very detailed ecological assessment. It needs to count the plants in the hedgerow. I do not suppose it occurred to Ministers of the day, or even to some civil servants, who should know better, that during the winter months many of the plants which might grow in the hedgerow and which the local authority is supposed to count cannot be seen. In any case, in the winter months--although perhaps less so in the more salubrious south--snow is frequently encountered. Even with global warming, snow can last for quite a few days, especially if it drifts along hedgerows in hilly areas. It is not possible for a local government officer to count plants in a hedgerow which might have a couple of feet of snow upon it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para17"></a>More foolish, and what annoyed me most, was the attempt by the Ministry to say which plants were native English species. Someone must have delved deep into pre-history to ascertain how long plants had been growing in this country. Some plants that we regard as an essential part of the English scene were not approved in the Government's regulations, which were badly flawed. Since it is now two years since the Government took office, I hope that it will not be long before we have the improvements that are so greatly needed. Those improvements should in no way weaken the protection by which so much of British land is possessed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para18"></a>I had taken the view that protection under the enclosure awards applied to the 4,000 Acts of enclosure enacted before 1840. I understand that the splendid recent work of the House of Commons Environment Select Committee on field boundaries has established that the protection may have come much more recently than 1840. For example, many measures, such as the turnpike measures, passed after that time require large areas of hedgerows to be perpetually maintained. Unfortunately, turnpikes have served their social purpose. The obligations placed upon those responsible for them have passed to the local authorities, some of which appear to have been unaware of the responsibilities devolved upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para19"></a>It is a very complex area, but the value of our landscape and the importance of our habitat are issues to which conservationists will be giving much greater attention at as the years pass. My noble friend the Minister will be aware that there are two cases before the courts which may well extend the protective cloak of law provided by the Flamborough judgment. That judgment was a masterly piece of historic and legal work. I remember feeling somewhat restive because the judge seemed to be taking a long time. However, when the judgment appeared it was obvious that it had been reached on the basis of a very skilled, highly <P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>professional and masterly study of the historic position. That has given the conservation bodies in Britain a great deal of hope and a very substantial opportunity to pursue protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para20"></a>I hope that in many cases that will not be necessary, but I should like my noble friend to confirm that the parish councils and all other local authorities have obligations in this matter. Parish councils may be very small. They may not have much money and they may not have many responsibilities, but they have an obligation to look after the local interest, and if there is a measure in their area which protects the landscape it is reasonable to suggest that they have an obligation to have regard for that particular matter. It could be seen as a duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para21"></a>The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust has recently raised another matter. If a hedgerow lies between fields owned by two different people, one may protect the hedge. If the hedge is by the side of a road, the local highways authority is responsible for one side of the hedge and can ensure that the hedge is protected. That is an obligation of which local authorities need to be reminded because sometimes they have neglected to ensure that they act properly in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para22"></a>It is a great deal more complicated than the approach which I adopted in 1982 because the Hedgerows Bill which I proposed, at a time of vast and rapid destruction, was extremely simple. I proposed that the Government should protect and that Parliament should enact the protection of hedgerows forming the boundary of farm and parish and those beside highways, footpaths and bridleways. That is a much smaller degree of protection than the Government may now like but it would have taken us a considerable way forward and it is a pity that it was not enacted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para23"></a>I hope that we can have not merely good sense but also the imaginative approach now required. I urge the Government to adopt the reassuring approach adopted in the last manifesto. I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="90428-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, some 26 years ago, I made my maiden speech on fencing and hedgerows while my noble friend Lord Ferrers was sitting on the Front Bench as Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture. Shortly after that, a fencing grant was introduced which also gave grants for removing hedgerows, to which the noble Lord has just referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para24"></a>I admit, with no sense of guilt whatever, to removing quite a few hedgerows, but I admit also, with a certain amount of embarrassment, I am sorry to say, that I have won two awards for my remaining hedges.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para25"></a>I make that introduction to point out the difficult decision as regards what should and should not be an important hedgerow; who is to make that judgment; and on what grounds it should be made. I must tell your Lordships that I am fed up to the back teeth with being told how to manage my farm by those who have no practical experience of having to make a living from farming. Indeed, it is my view that those who like to order my--our--affairs, be they various quangos or voluntary green organisations, consist of members who <P>


<a name="column_358"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have little experience of having to farm for a profit in order to support a family; or, if they do have that experience, they are privileged in that they have inherited the farm free of mortgage or with no rent to pay, which inevitably means that they look on farming in a totally different light from those, such as myself, who have had to make those payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para26"></a>I raised objection to the hedgerows legislation in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and again in a classically humorous yet very serious debate on the laying of the order, in which I had to divert the wrath of my noble friend Lord Ferrers on to my noble and green friend Lord Marlesford. In company with others, he criticised my noble friend Lord Ferrers for bringing forward regulations which were pathetic and weak. I, of course, criticised my noble friend because his regulations were too severe.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para27"></a>The problem is that it is extremely difficult to try to legislate on what is or is not an important hedgerow. I am glad to say that that difficulty is illustrated by the fact that the Government, although promising to bring forward a revised order in the autumn of 1997, have not yet done that. I congratulate the Government on that. It is, indeed, strange for the Government to think before they act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para28"></a>Your Lordships will no doubt say that I am an arch farmer--I am--driven by greed and thoughtlessness. In mitigation, I say that it is only when one becomes deeply involved in the day-to-day practical work of running a farm, which I have done for 50 years, rather than viewing it from the comfort of some quango boardroom et al that one realises that nature forces itself upon one. As the right reverend Prelate is in his place, perhaps I may be so bold to say that "Nature" is God. One must reconcile one's efforts to her ways. But that certainly does not mean submission--God never meant that--to her, or, more importantly, to stupid legislation. I am sure that the noble Baroness will make sure that it is not stupid.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para29"></a>Perhaps I may say a few words to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, about the ruling. As I understand it, the legal case in relation to the enclosure matter to which he referred was a very narrow ruling on an entirely geographical matter. Therefore, it is not nationwide.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para30"></a>I suppose that today, if I am going to be hung for a lamb, I may as well be hung for a sheep. Perhaps it is the other way round, but as a sheep is worth nothing, it must be for a lamb! Whatever happens, the farmer's view really must be paramount. If it is not, no regulation will work. Non-co-operation is the worst scenario, for there are many more ways of destroying a hedgerow than using a bulldozer. Keeping stock is one of them.

I first got to know him when we were both on the Council of Europe together. That is now an admirable body celebrating its 50th year. The work which he did then was extremely valuable. I congratulate him on that and on what he has been doing ever since in this field.

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para31"></a>There is obviously a need for farm boundaries and for boundaries in the countryside, for obvious reasons, the most obvious being the keeping in or out of various livestock, although that is less and less important these days as there is less and less livestock mixed farming in the countryside.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para32"></a>However, it is important that there should be appropriate boundaries. Barbed wire will not always do. It is not always the most appropriate option. It is not at all sightly, but that is not necessarily the main point. There is a need to resist soil loss by wind blow, and with climate change that may become much more important than it is at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para33"></a>There is a need for boundaries to provide homes for wildlife, and with the growing loss of wildlife, particularly of birds, in the countryside that becomes more and more important. There is also a need for boundaries which do not provide hazards to either wildlife or human beings. I draw attention to the Unstarred Question which is being asked this evening by my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford about the fate of the capercaillie. To a certain extent, that is governed by the fact that enormous losses are caused because that stupid bird flies into deer fences and injures or kills itself. We therefore have a need to produce not only field boundaries but appropriate field boundaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para34"></a>We have at last stopped paying people to grub out hedges; we now even pay them to plant them. There is one major point I should like to make. Although I do not go a very great deal of the way with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Stanley, as noble Lords can imagine, nevertheless I join with him on this matter, as I think he will with me. I refer to the fact that we must be aware of the need to subsidise the continuing care of field boundaries. Money is not just needed to plant them; it is needed in order to look after them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para35"></a>I know people who are members of the Family Farms Association or the Small Farms Alliance who would very much like to plant more hedges and to look after them. They do not complain at the amount of subsidy they receive for planting hedges, but say they cannot afford to look after them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para36"></a>We all know that looking after a hedge by staking and binding it, or by cutting and laying it, is heavily labour-costed. The same is true of dry-stone walls in appropriate areas. Help must be given. In the present appalling state of farm finances--here, I entirely sympathise with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Stanley--we cannot expect the very people who would willingly look after farm boundaries to plant more unless they know that they will not incur great losses by so doing. That is not the case at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para37"></a>In certain areas it is much easier. I have the honour to be on the governing body, as vice president, of National Parks, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary. That organisation manages to maintain the skills needed for the preservation of field boundaries and is to be congratulated on so doing. The Government need to consider this whole matter. They need to provide money to enable those farmers who really want to do their duty in this particular area--I entirely agree with <P>


<a name="column_360"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 360</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, as to what their duty is--to do it without serious monetary loss at a time when farming is going through a very difficult period.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-08_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, first, perhaps I may declare an interest in so far as I have been involved with agriculture all my life. Like my noble friend Lord Stanley, I have also pulled up hedges and, like him, I do not regret having done so because that was in the nature of the farming enterprise.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para38"></a>Secondly, and possibly more importantly, perhaps I may apologise to your Lordships, and in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, for the fact that I was not in my place for the earlier part of his speech. I am afraid to say that I was stuck in traffic and could not get here.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para39"></a>The subject of hedgerows is always a deeply sensitive matter because people have wildly differing views. Sometimes it does not do any harm to remember that in the days before enclosures there were not many hedges. Then we had the enclosures, and we had lots of hedges. As the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley stated, they are the habitat for wildlife.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para40"></a>As agriculture has increased and changed its methods, as has every other industry during the past 50 years, it has been necessary to make fields larger. Similarly, people now want to go to great big supermarkets and those have squeezed out the village shops. That is a great sorrow. In the same way, so I believe large farms have, up to a point, tended to make small fields a thing of the past. At any rate, small fields have become uneconomical. Therefore, it is perfectly justifiable to make them more economical. Curiously, many people do not realise that, despite all the row about pulling up hedges, more hedges are planted each year than are pulled up. Folk do not always get the credit for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para41"></a>There is a great move to try to regulate everything, which I believe is a great mistake. Many people say that they are conservationists. This debate is almost the conservationist versus the agriculturist argument; but it should not be so. The majority of farmers and agriculturists are also great conservationists. It is they who have the responsibility of trying to look after the land, which means looking after the hedges and everything else that goes on the land.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para42"></a>However, there has been a great move to try to have some form of regulation for hedges. The great conservation bodies are great pressure groups, and pressure was put on the previous government, as I have no doubt that it is being put on this Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para43"></a>I had the privilege of serving in the Department of the Environment when the subject of hedgerows came up. Perhaps I can let your Lordships into a little secret. When you are a Minister in a department, some issues are at the top of the list of things you are keen on and some are at the bottom. The implementing of hedgerow regulations was at the bottom of my list of priorities. I was not at all enamoured with the idea and I tried to persuade my colleagues of that; but, as they say in the current jargon, "You lose some and you win some". I did not find that I won very many.
<P>


<a name="column_361"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para44"></a>At any rate, it was determined that there should be regulations. These blessed regulations had to come through my patch. I was disturbed about that. I thought that they were deeply bureaucratic and almost unintelligible. I said to those with whom I had the privilege of working that I thought it embarrassing to put on the statute book something that you could not understand. I said that if I, as a Minister with the privilege of civil servants to draft regulations, could not understand them, I wondered how others would do so. I am not, I hope, being at all condemnatory of the officials who did wonderful work. However, it is a complicated subject. The trouble with any regulations is that as soon as you try to make them easier, you are taken down further paths and they become more complicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para45"></a>Eventually, some 15 pages of regulations were produced on how one should or should not pull out hedgerows. Suddenly, the election was called. "Hurray, hurrah" some of us said because all business was guillotined. If certain Bills were not passed by the time of the election, they were dropped--and the regulations were to be dropped. I had the greatest sympathy for other Ministers in my department who were keen on this issue, but I thought, "Thank goodness. These regulations will now fall". However, much to my horror, they appeared like a big whale, leaping out of the water. The day before Parliament was dissolved I was told that I had to take the regulations through your Lordships' House. They were my last piece of business ever from the Front Bench in your Lordships' House. I was disturbed at that prospect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-08_para46"></a>However, the regulations were passed. Your Lordships charmingly approved them and we are now lumbered with those 15 pages of regulations. The upshot of all this, as I hope that your Lordships will understand, is not that I intend to be disloyal to my colleagues or to the officials who worked wonderfully on this issue, but, to return to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, these regulations are very complicated. If the noble Baroness can do anything within her department to stop people making regulations, she should do it; it does not matter what they are about. For goodness sake, let us not have any more. They make life too complicated.

He then said, "They can say that and they can mean it, but it will be the civil servants who will badger the thing to death". That was said about nationalisation.

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, I want to express my warm welcome to this debate and my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, for initiating it. I should also like to thank the Government for being willing to review the 1997 regulations. I believe that those regulations have achieved a good deal. They have saved considerable lengths of historically and ecologically important hedgerows; but they are too complicated and, I believe that in some respects they are not strong enough. The criteria by which a hedge is judged to be important are complex and narrowly drawn. I warmly approve of the attempt to define what is important, and I think one has to acknowledge that the authorities have tried to operate these regulations in a responsible and conscientious way.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para0"></a>I want to speak particularly of Herefordshire, which I know best. The success of the unitary authority in Herefordshire has been quite encouraging. Fifty-five per cent of hedges proposed for removal have been protected--3.6 kilometres out of 5.3 kilometres, for which application was made--but the planning authority itself greatly regrets the lack of a landscape criterion. Again and again important hedges have been lost. They are important in landscape terms because the critical need to retain a rich and diverse beautiful network of small fields in certain special areas has not been supported in any sense by the regulations. In particular, the requirements of a specific number of woody species to define the length of a hedge is very complicated and too demanding and, as has already been said, in winter you cannot tell which is which.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para1"></a>I suggest that it could at least be simplified by, say, five woody species in 100 metres or less of hedge, with no reference to the associated features, which complicate the present arrangements. So I would add my voice to the many asking for a landscape value criterion which would complement the proper emphasis on ecology and history in the existing regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para2"></a>I want to draw particular attention to one aspect of hedgerow destruction which receives very little publicity. It is not well understood, I believe, and in fact is encouraged by the present agricultural support system for hill farmers. Of course the origin of the problem, if one wants to call it a problem, of hedgerow destruction was, and still is, in arable country. The demands of farmers for larger acreages on which ever larger machinery can operate has been part of the desire for greater efficiency. In many ways that is entirely laudable and necessary, although the price in terms of the transformation of the landscape is one which needs to be carefully weighed. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stanley, and others who have said that farming is an important industry and it has to be taken seriously; but it is a case of balance between the needs of the farmer and the needs of the community which values the landscape and may be prepared to pay for it.

<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para3"></a>I am acutely aware of a particular problem in rural Herefordshire and Shropshire, in the hill country of the Welsh Marches. Here it is not a question of farmers applying to remove hedges, but of the progressive and relentless degradation of hedges by grazing patterns, which are themselves the direct result of the policy of subsidies designed to give those hill farmers a precarious living. It is precarious, but it is some kind of living. For 35 years I have known and loved the walk up Black Hill, the Cat's Back, a protruding spine of the Black Mountains, from which point you can look west into the remote and beautiful Olchon Valley or east towards the lush pastures of the Wye Valley. Westwards, this view has hardly changed in hundreds of years. Eastwards, for the first mile or so there are still the small steep fields; and then the further you go the larger the fields become, many of them at this time of year hideous with oil seed rape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para4"></a>Eastwards a lot of hedges have been removed, but not as many as in other parts of England. However, it is the Olchon Valley itself, and many similar upland landscapes, which are under a new threat. This is the structure of agricultural support. The system of paying farmers for production units, that is headage payments on each ewe, coupled with the low cost of purchasing those production units, at the moment increases the number of sheep grazing the land. The headage payment is &#163;8.88 per ewe for "specially qualified ewes". A further upland subsidy of &#163;4.09 is claimable. Ewes of this type are very cheap to buy, and quota, which confers the entitlement to both payments, can be bought or leased. This encourages the farmer to acquire more sheep and to bid high for "keep" in upland areas, far above their real values as grazing land.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para5"></a>A farmer can buy a ewe for &#163;8 and be paid nearly &#163;13 per year for keeping it, and so he keeps too many. By contrast, the countryside stewardship scheme requires farmers to observe strict stocking limits, refrain from using fertiliser and maintain hedges. These restrictions preclude revenue from letting grazing, but the CSS pays only &#163;35 an acre on species-rich meadows, and nothing at all on rye grass and clover leys. So there is no incentive for these farmers to enter into a stewardship agreement when they can reap subsidies for extensive sheep grazing, either themselves or by the price they can charge for the grass keep.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para6"></a>It is a sad fact that government policy is exacerbating the decline of upland hedgerows. The present legislation has to be welcomed, but I would suggest two further measures which I hope may stem from this review. First, I believe we should decouple the land management and the hedgerow management components of the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, so that farmers who are currently discouraged from using the scheme because it imposes such demands on them in terms of land management could still subscribe to the hedgerow management measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para7"></a>Secondly, and more importantly, we should institute area payments heavily weighted in favour of environmental criteria. This is the single best change to protect our landscape and, incidentally, the family farm. Headage payments on production units are illogical in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>a world where red meat is over-supplied. They simply encourage high numbers, poor husbandry and landscape dereliction. This is a nonsensical way to spend public money, helping to destroy what we want to protect and producing what we do not want or need.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para8"></a>The over-production, of course, does depress prices and further distorts the market, and so, while I would urge an imaginative and wide-ranging review of the present legislation, I hope that the noble Baroness may be able to give your Lordships some indication that the Government recognise this particular unwelcome and undesirable aspect of our farm support system. I hope she will be able to give a firm indication that funds can be redirected in a more environmentally beneficial direction. It would be very warmly welcomed by those who care about both our upland hedges and our family farms.

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, the more I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, the more I thought that his opening comment was not quite accurate. He said he had always been interested in the conservation of hedgerows. I thought it was more the preservation of hedgerows that interested him. I would not have been at all surprised, had the noble Lord been alive when the enclosure Acts were put before Parliament, that he would have been the first to vote against them because they would have altered the countryside as he knew it then.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para9"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Ferrers, I am against regulations and I was sad that the government I supported introduced the regulations when they did. Regulations should be introduced only when they are absolutely necessary, and I do not believe them to be necessary for hedgerows. What saddens me more is that it is absolutely instinctive for any Labour Party to ratchet up and increase regulation and put a further burden on individuals. If we are going to continue to have these regulations, I make a plea to the noble Baroness that they should be transparent, equitable and objective. It should be vital that every farmer should be able to understand clearly, whether he farms in the uplands or the lowlands, what the purport of the regulations is and to implement them to the best of his ability without additional costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para10"></a>I thoroughly support the protection of hedgerows and their conservation, but it is not only the protection of hedgerows that I support. It is equally important to preserve the dry-stone walls of Oxfordshire, where I have spent so much of my life, and the slate walls of Caithness, in the right circumstances. Again, it comes back to balance, and there must be balance in the regulations between the environmental and aesthetic aspects and the needs of the farmer to continue to farm into the next millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para11"></a>It is quite clear that this Labour Government are no great friend of the countryside. This Labour Government will reduce the support given to farmers and, given that, the farmers must have the flexibility to be able to continue to farm profitably on the land. We cannot put the countryside into a glass case and preserve <P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it as it is now. That has never worked in the past and will never work in the future. The countryside is a place where people live and work; they struggle for an existence. Many farmers are having a really tough time at the moment and the more regulations one imposes on them that they cannot sustain, the more the countryside will deteriorate. Farmers will be reluctant to pursue their traditional role as custodians of the countryside.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para12"></a>It is management of the countryside that is important. It is only through good management that one will be able to preserve the things that we like to see so much. And I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, if I were still a land agent and read his speech, I regret that I would be tempted to go to my clients--my farmers, tenant farmers and landowners--and say, "Look, this is only going to get worse for you. My advice is to get on and reshape your farm as quickly as possible before they make it harder for you to take out hedgerows with any flexibility". I am sad to say that. I would not like to give that advice; but if I were to go back to my old job as a land agent, that is the advice I would have to give, because it seems to me that matters are going to get worse.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para13"></a>Let me move on quickly to a topic that has not yet been raised. I refer to the question of genetic engineering and farming. Sir Robert May, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, gave advice to a Select Committee in another place. Sadly, that advice has not yet been printed and I shall therefore have to rely on press reports. I do not like relying on press reports; I have never found them accurate in the past but it is the best I can do today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para14"></a>The press report claims that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sir Robert did, however, also warn the committee that commercial genetically modified crops could ruin wildlife unless there was tight regulation...they could intensify the dramatic postwar decline in songbirds, insects, wild flowers and hedgerows".
Here we have a new aspect of farming to hit us hard in the next millenium that could destroy the very thing we are debating tonight. Could the noble Baroness update me as to exactly what the position is on this? If the farmer next door to my noble friend Lord Stanley plants genetically engineered crops and destroys the hedgerows that he wishes to maintain, who is at fault? Where is the liability on that? Will the regulations have anything to say on that matter?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para15"></a>Finally, I wish to reiterate just one matter. Will the noble Baroness please concentrate on the management of the countryside, not on further regulation?

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Grantchester: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Hardy for raising this debate tonight. I declare an interest as a dairy farmer in Cheshire who can claim to have laid and planted probably more than double the length of hedges than he has removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para16"></a>It is little more than a year since the 1997 hedgerow regulations came into force. That is hardly long enough to draw too many hard conclusions about the effects of this measure. While removals and plantings around town or road developments may occur at any time, farm <P>


<a name="column_366"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>operations would tend to be concentrated during spring or autumn cultivations. Statistically, this would be a small sample on which to base conclusions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para17"></a>The 1997 regulations require a person wanting to remove a hedgerow to seek prior approval from the local planning authority, which decides whether it is important in terms of its wildlife, historical or landscape value and whether it should be protected. At the time these regulations became law, it was considered that only 20 per cent of hedgerows were likely to be deemed important. From the information provided by the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) in its excellent booklet, Hedging Your Bets, experience since seems to bear out that figure. On page 7, the CPRE claims that only 20 per cent of hedgerows are being protected, ranging from around 10 per cent in the North East and West, to around 39 per cent in East Anglia and 33 per cent in the South West. The booklet goes on to claim that that is woefully inadequate. I am not so convinced. Perhaps the Minister tonight can indicate whether the Government are still content with that 20 per cent figure, or whether they would like to see that figure increased.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para18"></a>It must not be forgotten that hedgerows are natural boundary fences. It would not be unexpected that they would change following changes in the area they enclose. Losses arise from many causes, including development, roads and neglect. It would be helpful if a review could indicate how important each of those regions is, and portray the differing regional trends in hedgerow loss and standards of management. That could prove instructive in developing the criteria for assessing the importance of a hedgerow; for example, hedgerows which qualify for protection by all other criteria are excluded if they border gardens or are in an urban area. Furthermore, it is important that the implications of any change in the criteria are fully assessed before any changes are made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para19"></a>The amount of hedgerows at any one time will also depend on the rate of new plantings. It is my understanding that in the last recorded period, 1990-93, new plantings exceeded removal. More diverse species can often be used in new plantings; blackthorn, the bane of many a hedge to a livestock farmer, can be reduced. In conducting its survey, it would have proved instructive if the CPRE had recorded details of new plantings to provide a picture regarding the development of our hedgerow landscape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para20"></a>The CPRE questionnaire dealt only with the hedgerow protection regulations and was directed at local authorities. It would prove extremely beneficial in this debate to have the input of the advice of information agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group. Any review must also take into account how hedgerows have benefited under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, environmentally sensitive areas and Tir Cymen, with its successor Tir Gofal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para21"></a>The FWAG, which I understand is the only organisation to implement biodiversity on farms, operates on the principle of "no net loss of hedges". In <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other words, where hedges have to be removed, new ones should always be planted to at least the length that was removed. In the last available FWAG advisory statistics for England for the year April 1997 to March 1998, of approximately 4,500 advisory visits, 69 per cent included advice on hedge management, 55 per cent on field margins and 37 per cent included direct advice on hedge planting.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para22"></a>The rural landscape must not be simply frozen in protection legislation, but its development enhanced by positive schemes. Hedgerow legislation needs to be administered via a regional and local framework. If administered in the planning department of local authorities, local knowledge and expertise must be drawn upon to assess hedgerows and allow greater liaison with other departments and environmental agencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para23"></a>Local authority biodiversity plans and farmers' habitat action plans have the potential to sustain the environmental value of hedgerows in a more meaningful way and to work alongside protection. Management options could be more widely promoted in renovating boundary hedges, including stone walls and ditches. Additional resources will be needed for this purpose, but should not be found at the expense of other activities supported by the agri-environmental schemes. A real increase in the funds available for agri-environmental schemes is needed. Those schemes are already over-subscribed. Funds should be sought through urgent reforms to the common agricultural policy (CAP) by changing this into a rural development policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para24"></a>As a side issue, I should like to stress that "cross-compliance" is not the way forward. It will bring an added costly level of bureaucracy that, once enacted, will become entrenched and will prop up unwanted production support. Funds must be targeted on what they seek to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para25"></a>The conclusion to be drawn from the CPRE booklet, Hedging Your Bets, is that experience of the hedgerow regulations 1997 has shown the difficulties of establishing a simple regulatory regime that properly reflects the changing needs of land management while safeguarding the environmental values associated with boundaries. Time, further analysis and consideration of alternative initiatives is needed before the extension of protection to hedgerows and, indeed, other field, road or urban boundaries is embarked upon.

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Middleton: </B>   My Lords, any discussion about hedgerows has to take into account the fact that their agricultural functions differ widely within the UK. Their functions in the livestock farms west of the Pennines, in the South West and in Wales are largely different from those in the arable East of England where their chief function was to mark the boundaries of fields and holdings fixed during the enclosures. In the drained fen lands of south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, there never were any hedges. To grow them on that land would have been a gross misuse of that very fertile soil.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para26"></a>The environmental importance of hedgerows is a different matter. It gives rise to public concern and a call for orders and regulations, hence the hedgerow regulations 1997. As a farmer, I understand the functions--and sometimes lack of any function--of hedges. I understand why many miles of hedgerows were grubbed up in the post-war years. At the same time, I am on the side of the conservationists in wishing to preserve hedges which are environmentally important and which enhance the landscape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para27"></a>As has been said, on purely practical grounds hedgerows can prevent erosion; but, more importantly, if insects and grubs are not kept under control by other insects and by birds which depend upon the hedgerows, disaster threatens. However, it goes deeper than that: there is a love of our countryside that animates all of us, from town and country alike. None of us wants to see a landscape like that of Oklahoma.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para28"></a>What do you see now if you drive around England and Wales? You do see farms, especially in East Anglia and the East Midlands and, I am sorry to say, in some parts of the North of England where I come from, where hedges have been removed, yet the greater part of rural England and Wales is, to all appearances, untouched.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para29"></a>Hedge removal in some areas was overdone, giving farmers a bad name. But although I do not have up-to-date removal statistics, I guess from what I see that the pattern of the countryside has stabilised. I know of many farms where new hedges have been planted and it is evident that farmers are now well aware of their responsibility for the appearance and ecology of the land that they occupy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para30"></a>The hedgerow regulations 1997 now provide a regulatory floor to protect important hedgerows. As we have heard, they may need tidying up. But do we need more regulation to govern the activities of the harassed farmers of the millennium? As the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, reminded us, planners are already faced with the most difficult task in assessing which hedges are important in terms of historical, landscape and wildlife value. The first involves laborious research and the second and third, as the noble Lord reminded us, require difficult subjective judgments before permission for removal can be granted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para31"></a>I believe that the carrot is a more effective instrument than the stick of tighter regulations. One form of incentive of which I am not in favour is "cross-compliance", whereby grants and subsidies to farmers are dependent upon certain prescribed activities; for example, the maintenance of hedges. While I was serving on Sub-Committee D, I heard many witnesses to our inquiries recommending cross-compliance, yet I never heard a satisfactory answer to the question: "Well, what happens when a grant or subsidy is phased out as the common agricultural policy undergoes reform?"
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para32"></a>Had this debate been held before March of this year, I would have said that the environmental payments recommended by the Commission in Agenda 2000 should be used to provide incentives for such things as hedgerow management. However, these Agenda 2000 proposals were considerably watered down as a result of <P>


<a name="column_369"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Berlin meeting of the Heads of State on 26th March. Nevertheless, it will now be mandatory for member states to run environmental programmes--these may include cross-compliance requirements--but, as I understand it, there is a discretion for member states to make environmental payments decoupled from farm support payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para33"></a>While funding will be considerably less than generous, it is still available for separate agri- environmental measures. It is in this area that I believe Her Majesty's Government should be delving in order to produce incentives rather than going further down the regulatory road. It will need great ingenuity to find the money to do it.

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gladwyn: </B>   My Lords, hedgerow protection was first introduced only two years ago. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, has frankly told us that even that was a bit of a fluke. However, I am one of those who believe that some legislation was necessary following that introduced regarding trees. After all, in the past half century the total length of hedgerows has diminished by nearly half, and at a pretty constant rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para34"></a>We have to accept that the greater part of the destruction had to happen. No one could reasonably suggest that the field patterns of pre-mechanical farming, whose intricacies were fortuitously photographed by the Luftwaffe over southern England in 1940, could have remained unchanged if British agriculture was to flourish. The governments of the day provided grants for the grubbing up of hedgerows. Urban development, airfield construction and highway improvement also played their part. But it was also excessive and, in many cases, particularly in the cornlands of eastern England, ruthlessly executed to maximise farm incomes without any regard for ecological considerations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para35"></a>It has to be said that during this period members of the public were altogether unconcerned about hedgerow destruction, just as they had been about the destruction of ancient buildings before the 1960s. Until the 1980s it was not a political issue. Most land managers now share the general disquiet about what has happened. Many are prepared to help to rectify the loss, assisted by Countryside Stewardship and other schemes. During the three years from 1990-93 a greater mileage of new hedgerows was planted than was destroyed. It was probably of an even higher proportion in subsequent years. We hear from the noble Lords, Lord Stanley and Lord Grantchester, and indeed the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, how they have been planting new hedges in great lengths. I see also that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is in his place. He has shown me long distances of new hedges planted on his estate in Suffolk.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para36"></a>However, it is the continuing destruction that exercises us today. It continues despite the new regulations which anyway only affect about a fifth of the total remaining hedgerows. The main thrust of the Government's review of last year is that clearer criteria should be set for the importance of hedgerows in respect of landscape and wildlife and that notification of <P>


<a name="column_370"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 370</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hedgerow removal should be lengthened. It is expected that the Government will shortly issue changes to the regulations which should substantially increase the proportion of preservable hedgerows. At a later stage, the Government may introduce primary legislation to grant local authorities the right to determine whether a particular hedgerow is of importance. I believe that such measures can be desirable so long as they simplify rather than complicate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para37"></a>The urgency of the need to stiffen the regulations is powerfully emphasised by the new report published by the CPRE, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester. The report demonstrates effectively wide regional variations in terms of the proportion of protectable hedgerows and in terms of the particularities of the landscape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para38"></a>The CPRE report also raises the further question of hedgerow maintenance, pointing out that neglect rather than wanton destruction is now the main threat. It suggests that incentives should be given for hedge repair. That seems eminently sensible. However, the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, who is to be commended for providing us with today's debate, has put forward the idea that the provisions of the ancient enclosure Acts should be invoked requiring farmers to keep their hedges in good condition. As many old hedgerows are in such a state that they would have to be completely relaid, I presume that the cost would be enormous. Bearing in mind the extensive planting of new hedges, which is such an encouraging feature of the countryside today, enforcement of this ancient legislation would, in my opinion, be most uncalled for and unfortunate. I hope that the court cases will not lead to a general move to enforce it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para39"></a>The fact is that most of the hedgerows of today exist because they enhance the look of the countryside, demarcate boundaries, and act as sanctuaries for wildlife. Only a minority provide an economic benefit, and most livestock is now controlled by electric fencing. Consequently, most hedgerows, no longer cropped or ditched, have expanded from close cropped barriers which a horse could easily jump into wide bushes along lines of trees.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para40"></a>It can be argued that in some ways the appearance of the landscape has actually been improved compared with a century ago when hedges were small and treeless except for pollarded stumps and when there were far fewer mature trees. William Cobbett, during his travels in eastern England, painted a not very attractive picture of some of the agricultural countryside in that respect. It is fascinating to walk in Dedham Vale to the precise points where Constable painted his canvases and to observe how hedge-trees have altered the scene. From the side of the valley the scene appears largely wooded, although in fact it is pastoral. Old straggly hedgerows can thus enhance the landscape, even if they sometimes provide a diminished habitat for natural life.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para41"></a>There are several pleasant ironies in the changes in public attitude towards hedgerows. When first introduced, the hedges and ditches with which farmers bounded their fields were always hated by the peasantry who thereby lost their common pastures and were <P>


<a name="column_371"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restricted to farm labour. But today these symbols of human exploitation are regarded as the adornments of the landscape and the sanctuaries of natural life. Likewise, in our own lifetime, when hedgerows generally have ceased to be beneficial to farmers, they have often been preserved for the purposes of hunting and shooting--sports which are despised by many people today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para42"></a>But one central fact remains above all others. Hedgerows are merely the boundaries of fields. Fields exist because of agriculture. If agriculture declines, fields will themselves deteriorate into areas of rough ground, ultimately growing into woods. When this happens, the hedge will no longer be a hedge. An awful warning of what might happen is apparent to anyone who has travelled through New England. There are endless square miles of grim secondary woodland growth. If one walks beneath it, one can discern the desolate stone walls of former fields. Let us ensure that old England never goes the same way.

All the fields around were bounded by hedgerows and it was a joy to look out from our raised position on to this marvellous patchwork. The farmer described his methods as traditional; we would now say they were organic. He loved wildlife, birds and butterflies and taught my children, who were young at the time, how to spot and identify the different creatures, many of which either lived in the hedgerows or sheltered under them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para45"></a>County councils, as the traffic authority, are responsible for maintaining the hedgerows along the roadside. Safety is one of the most important factors and so these hedgerows are trimmed but not destroyed. It is the hedgerows within the fields that are at risk, and those who aim, by destruction of the ancient hedgerows, to convert English fields into American-style prairies are very shortsighted. I have seen the devastating effect in Australia where severe soil erosion has been the result of over-ambitious clearing of the land.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para46"></a>In Oxfordshire last week the hedgerows were alight with hawthorn blossoms. The very sight of them lifted my spirits. I strongly support the retention of hedgerows of native species in rural situations. However, an <P>


<a name="column_372"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 372</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>entirely different situation exists where--usually in urban areas--unsuitable "foreign" boundary hedges are planted. I think it is very important for the Government and the public to appreciate the difference and I hope that in the DETR review of the 1997 hedgerow regulations, maintaining this distinction will not be overlooked.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para47"></a>I know that Members of Parliament are increasingly encountering such cases in their constituencies, and Hedgeline is having a major meeting in the Grand Committee Room tomorrow. Hedgeline is an organisation which advises and helps those who suffer loss of light, damage to buildings through subsidence, and loss of the proper use of their gardens for plant growing and recreation due to dense, evergreen conifers planted on, or close to, garden boundaries. The culprits in these unneighbourly situations are not British native trees but Lawson cypress introduced from Canada or Leyland cypress, a relatively new hybrid with an amazing speed of growth. These trees rapidly reach up to 100 feet in height. Planted along boundaries between gardens, they have been a great cause of at least annoyance and even major nuisance between neighbours. It is interesting that if a person wishes to erect a garden wall between houses planning permission is required for anything higher than two metres. Yet a densely planted row of trees can grow without control and destroy a neighbour's amenity and sometimes cause great loss of light.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para48"></a>One district council not far from London, in an area beset by many of these problems already, has, in granting full planning permission for a new building, included conditions that a landscaping scheme must be agreed with the council. The type of hedge to be planted must be of a species agreed in writing with the council and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"thereafter maintained at a height between 2 and 4 metres to the satisfaction of the District Planning Authority".
The same planning consent also covers the point that,
<P>
<BR>
"no other new hedge shall be planted within five metres of that boundary without approval in writing of the District Planning Authority".
I commend this considerate and far-sighted approach. It seems clear to me that the council has been aware of the Birmingham case of Michael Jones on the Bournville Estate in Birmingham where neighbours fell out over hedge heights about 20 years ago. The court decision confirmed that Mr. Jones could trim the intervening hedge and he did so. The neighbour then planted a further parallel hedge inside the first hedge. The Bournville Village estate was established by George Cadbury as the prototype of an urban village almost 100 years ago. The trust which manages the properties confirmed to me yesterday that on 15th April it served a writ requiring the owners to maintain the inner hedge.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-09_para49"></a>Hedgeline wrote to English Nature to explain its aims and to seek common ground. In the reply, headed "Problem Hedgerows", English Nature set out its three interests: first, the appropriate management of hedgerows of native species on SSSIs; secondly, its role as part of the steering group of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for Ancient and Species Rich Hedgerows <P>


<a name="column_373"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and, thirdly, its involvement in the group chaired by the DETR reviewing the 1997 hedgerow regulations. Its final paragraph states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we have no involvement in disputes over unsuitable boundary hedgerows".
My contribution to this debate today is to make clear that Hedgeline is supportive of the aims of English Nature, and also to ensure that those involved in the review of the 1997 regulations should be fully aware of the different situation in urban areas and to draw attention to the wording in Regulation 3(3) of the present regulations which reads,
<P>
<BR>
"These Regulations do not apply to any hedgerow within the curtilage of, or marking a boundary of the curtilage of, a dwelling house".
This is an important point and should not be changed. Urban and rural hedges each require appropriate controls but the present clear distinction between the two should continue. I hope that the Minister is able to reassure me that, whatever other changes are proposed to the 1997 regulations on hedgerows, this unambiguous paragraph will remain.

<A NAME="90428-09_spnew8"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, for keeping before the House both the significance of our hedgerows and what is happening to them. Most people simply take hedgerows and, indeed, other field boundaries for granted. They see them as a God-given part of the landscape. They admire them and are inspired by their variety and colour, but perhaps rarely think about who maintains them and at what cost. They are simply there; we expect them to remain; but in reality, in some areas at least, they are slowly but surely disappearing. Indeed, I heard of a farmer in the West Midlands who last year lodged an application to remove nine kilometres of hedgerow from his land--virtually every hedgerow on his farm--and withdrew that application only after a local outcry. But he could well resubmit that application.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para50"></a>As we have heard, the picture differs from area to area, as the CPRE's recent report, Hedging our Bets, reveals. I take no pleasure that under current criteria in the north-west of England the protection is less than 10 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para51"></a>One of the main causes for this decline in maintenance and loss of our field boundaries is quite simply, but sadly, neglect. That is not very surprising since they are now less justified in agronomic terms and the cost of maintaining them, as we have heard, often brings little benefit to the farmers and landowners at a time when much of agriculture, in spite of increased government subsidy, is in a very real and serious depression. It is clear that there is a strong case for public support to recognise the benefits we all gain from the hedgerows and without which the decline will continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para52"></a>I must declare an interest--and with it my real concern--as a member of the former Countryside Commission for England and now of the new Countryside Agency. The Government are to be <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commended for, soon after their election, establishing the review group on how the existing regulations might be strengthened to provide more effective protection. The Countryside Commission was represented on that group and pressed strongly, as one might expect, for landscape considerations to be taken more adequately into account. As a result, as your Lordships may know, the commission commissioned land use consultants to identify locally distinctive hedgerows, which is an important part of the necessary detailed work. This work is now complete, I understand, and the agency hopes to receive its draft report next month.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para53"></a>In view of what is happening in the countryside to this valuable asset, I can do no more than to urge Her Majesty's Government to consider most carefully the appropriate way to allow further and appropriate protection. The matter is serious if all types of traditional field boundaries are to be protected before it is too late. I hope that consideration will be extended to include those dykes and ditches, banks and walls, which are the equivalent of hedgerows in some distinctive parts of our country. It would be a real shame if, having protected the hedgerows, other distinctive features of the landscape and important wildlife habitats were lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para54"></a>For reasons which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, eloquently suggested, this matter cannot be allowed to drag on. There is every evidence from recent history to suggest that if something is in the offing, people will take serious and dilatory action beforehand. I know of a case in Warwickshire where between the passing of the 1995 Act and the regulations coming into force a kilometre of 18th-century hedgerow was removed to create a 283-hectare field.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para55"></a>However, that said, we must be realistic. The result of such protective legislation will cost money to farmers and landowners who, although many are hard-pressed at the present time, are the stewards of our countryside, both to the Creator and to ourselves. There is, therefore, a further need to examine the potential for providing greater funding for such field boundaries currently under agro-environmental schemes. I would go further--in the light of the debate, I think I have support--and ask the Government to consider the potential for introducing a simple, stand-alone, agro-environmental scheme, the purpose of which would focus solely on field boundary protection, maintenance and development. I hope that the Minister will be able to give cause for hope that the Government will not delay but will continue with the good work they have begun in this area.

I wonder how many noble Lords speaking today have planted, cut or laid hedges.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para56"></a>When the enclosure Act came into being and fields were enclosed with stone walls and hedges, there was quite an outcry. Today the opposite tends to be true. As a land manager I look for the practical purposes of <P>


<a name="column_375"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>having hedgerows as well as the value to the landscape. One should not focus on just one item in our landscape but look at the landscape as a whole, including woodlands, copses, trees, hedges and grassy banks.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para57"></a>The purpose of a hedge is to be a boundary, a palisade and a shelter for stock. More recently, we believe it is also an important reservoir of wildlife and can often be beneficial to our crops. For it to be of any use as a stop barrier, the composition of a hedge should not include such things as elder, but thorn and the like, which is hardy and strong, and enables laying. Advisory groups such as FWAG, RSPB and ADAS give invaluable advice on this conservation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para58"></a>A farm is a commercial enterprise producing high quality foodstuffs that are sold in a very competitive world market. We have to bear that in mind when we consider what we want from hedges on our farms. I have a medium-sized farm. I believe that in an ideal world a field should be big enough to allow one or two combines to harvest it in a day--it should be, say, 20 to 40 hectares--but certainly bigger than in the days when ploughs were drawn by horses. Fields should be of a sensible size so that our high-tech equipment can travel in straight lines and reduce spray overlaps, thus ensuring that excesses of pesticides and fertilisers are minimised. Too many hedges on a farm lead to too much costly work and, consequently, poor quality hedging. Surely it must be correct to have one large field with a well-nurtured hedge on a good, wide, grassy boundary than several small fields with poor hedges, poor habitat for wildlife and more detrimental areas of spray overlaps.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para59"></a>There is much misunderstanding about the conservation of the landscape. For instance, from a wildlife point of view, trees in hedgerows are not necessarily a good thing. The natural predator of an English partridge is the goshawk, and goshawks live in trees. Thus, any wise partridge will never go near a tree in a hedgerow for fear of its natural predator. Over the past 25 years, grey partridges have declined by 78 per cent. It would be too simplistic to say that this decline would be halted or reversed by strengthening the hedgerow regulations. In fact, the number of hedgerows increased during part of that time. Sportsmen tend to prefer the more easily managed French variety. Most importantly, there has been a large rise in the grey partridge's natural predators. Another example is that of the barn owl, which flourishes on grassy banks where its prey lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para60"></a>I am a land manager who has planted, renovated and laid hedges as well as removing some hedges. At the end of the day, my aim is to enhance the landscape of our countryside in a beneficial way and to ensure that our landscape is not a decaying museum piece but a working, evolving landscape. I believe that land managers who live on their property and, most importantly, operate profitably, best do this. Subsidies given for conservation do not necessarily make land managers begin conservation work, but they do enable them to do considerably more than they would have done in the first place. Cross-compliance is not the way forward.

<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para61"></a>If the public wish further to enhance the landscape, then surely the public must bear some of the finance. I therefore question whether any more bureaucratic and expensive protection is necessary. Land managers require more advice, training and incentive and better farm profitability. I am sure that the Government will tell us when they intend to come forward with their conclusions on the 1997 hedgerow consultations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para62"></a>I should like to go over one or two points that were made in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Hardy, suggested that local authorities are responsible for the inside of hedges next to highways. I believe that the land beneath these hedges belongs to the farmer. I suggest that the hedges are the responsibility of the farmer. However, if that is not the case, one must surely ask whether those local authorities will help to finance the maintenance and laying of those hedges. I rather suspect that they will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para63"></a>Finally, on a more interesting point, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford referred to hideous oilseed rape. I have to agree with him because it is not really a conservative colour. It reminds me too much of the Liberal Democrats. It looks like they are canvassing around the countryside. However, I should like to point out that oilseed rape is an important crop. It produces oils not only for animal consumption but for human consumption. Most importantly, it produces extremely high quality oils used in cars which replace those unfriendly oils that are produced from minerals. It can also be used most advantageously for producing diesel.

<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para64"></a>I took over a bankrupt estate at the beginning of the 1970s. Had it not been for the grants available at that time, the turn-around of that estate into a viable farming operation would have been nigh on impossible and I could not have fulfilled the call for "more food from our own resources". I admit that with those grants of between 40 and 60 per cent, whether they were in the form of the earlier farm capital grant or the later farm and horticultural grant scheme of the European Union era, huge changes were made to the farm; not only in terms of providing drainage to nearly all the land, but also with regard to the realignment of hedges and the scrubbing of hedges to create the needed efficiencies of modern farming methods. Farmers were paid to remove hedges and increase production.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para65"></a>Where some farmers can be blamed is for the neglect of thousands of miles of hedges, or of stone walls, or of fencing generally. It is true that much grassland has been lost to cereal production, but farmers, whether tenants or landlords, should be caring guardians and trustees of that land for future generations. Farming is going through an extraordinarily difficult time, but hedges have been degenerating since the Second World War. It is interesting to note that one hectare of land is equivalent to six kilometres of hedge.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para66"></a>Not all, but many, hedgerows are being lost through neglect and poor management. Neglect is considered to be one of the primary causes of hedgerow destruction, <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with more than 110,000 kilometres of hedge apparently lost through neglect between 1984 and 1993 and 61 per cent of that neglect taking place since 1990. However, I agree that losses arise from the development of dwellings and industry, and from quarrying and road building too. Moreover, as my noble friend Lord Ferrers said, the rate of new planting in the latest recorded period, 1990-1993, exceeds removal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para67"></a>It is true, too, that more diverse species can be used in new planting. This will help to reverse the decline of tree sparrows, grey partridge, turtle doves and red bunting, to name but a few birds that specifically use hedgerows. Those hedgerow birds have had the highest percentage rate of decline, ranging from minus 64 per cent to a staggering minus 87 per cent loss between 1971 and 1996. Those figures come from the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para68"></a>The work carried out by the Council for the Protection of Rural England to review the impact and effectiveness of the hedgerow legislation has shown some interesting trends. The snapshot created by its work shows the relationship between hedgerow legislation, which uses a centrally determined definition of importance, and the great diversity of hedgerows across the country. It presents the first regional view of how the hedgerow regulations are being implemented across England, illustrating significant differences in the regional distribution of hedgerow removal. The information gathered highlights the lack of effective protection afforded to local hedgerows by the hedgerow regulations and reinforces the need for a wholesale revision of their operation to ensure that decisions regarding hedgerow removal are sensitive to local character and distinctiveness.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-09_para69"></a>So what are needed are clearer environmental objectives, supported by sensible advice, information and incentives, with farmers and managers being involved in habitat action plans and Agenda 21 local biodiversity plans.

<A NAME = "90428-09_para70"></a>National parks provide an example of inadequate protection. I declare an interest as a vice-president of National Parks. Hedgerows and stone walls must be seen in a broader context, taking in the landscape, of which they are, and should be, an integral part. I heard the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, mention the 25th anniversary of the national parks. In fact, it is the 50th anniversary.

<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para4"></a>We are mostly agreed that hedges are extremely important for the many reasons noble Lords have so eloquently explained. How can it be that we have such a clear understanding of what makes hedgerows important while we have criteria that are very complicated and dwell so extensively on the historical aspect alone? Birds certainly do not choose to live in a hedge because it is 300 rather than 150 years old, although I accept that the number of woody species will vary according to age. Certainly, stoats, weasels, and voles do not live under a hedge because it is a parish boundary.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para5"></a>Noble Lords agree that the regulations are over complicated. Any reform must make them less complicated so that we develop a much less narrow view of what constitutes an "important" hedgerow. The regulations reflect a centralist view of what is important. The current criteria therefore exclude so many sorts of hedgerow that they end up protecting only 20 per cent. They are most ill-equipped to take any local considerations into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Beaumont and the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, mentioned national parks. I find it extraordinary that neither areas of outstanding natural beauty nor national parks can do anything to protect the hedgerows in their landscapes. For example, in my area, Somerset, there are the distinctive local hedgerows of Exmoor. But they are single species hedgerows--beech--so they fall outside protection. We have a local planning system that should deliver preservation and take into account both national planning policy guidance and local views. It is quite a well-developed system. Good local authorities have <P>


<a name="column_379"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 379</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developed methods of consulting parish councils, appropriate agencies and organisations, and indeed applicants. That should be of some comfort to those who are worried that we try to over-regulate farmers. In my area, quite a number of parish, district and county councillors are farmers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para7"></a>I was interested to read the account of the debate that took place when the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, moved the regulations in this House in March 1997. The noble Earl said, at col. 1170 of the Official Report of 20th March 1997:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The countryside cannot be fossilised. It changes; indeed, it always will".
Of course he was right. But in terms of wildlife and landscape, public opinion is that matters have changed dramatically for the worse over past decades. To retain what is by common agreement extremely important, we need (the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, stole my words) to apply both stick and carrot. Our reference so far has been mainly to application of the stick, in the form of regulations, but the idea of the carrot was mentioned by several speakers. Most of the work of preserving, managing and replanting hedgerows falls on farmers. They are the ones who are being asked to sacrifice time and efficiency; and that costs money.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-10_para8"></a>Many of the reasons given by noble Lords for trying to retain more hedgerows are of no direct benefit to the farmer, and will sometimes prove a disbenefit. The benefits to wildlife and landscape are, equally, benefits to the local pub owner, the child, the pensioner, indeed anyone who lives in or visits a particular locality. So we should be willing to see that agri-environment measures recognise the "public good" element of a farmer's work. I am extremely disappointed that reform of the CAP is unlikely to recognise the wider role of the farmer as manager of the countryside and not simply as food producer. We must encourage the Government to address this matter wherever they can. The recent increase, for example, in the organic aid scheme is a positive step. And the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford had some good ideas on how to progress hedge conserving measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para9"></a>Several noble Lords mentioned the question of hedges as habitat and the phenomenal fall in the numbers of many farmland bird species. That fall has been much less marked where traditional patterns of agriculture have led to well-maintained hedgerows. The sterling work of the British Trust for Ornithology and of the RSPB has made sure that the effect on the bird population is widely known. But the effect on other dependants on the hedgerows is less well known. I refer, for example, to mammals and wild flowers. The margins around a hedgerow are often the only place to find wild flowers in an intensively agricultural area. Those of your Lordships who spent last weekend in the countryside might have seen pink campion, cow parsley, cowslips and bluebells, but those are now mostly to be found underneath hedgerows and not all over the fields. They are the kinds of flowers that make the English countryside memorable, distinctive and special. <P>


<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, they are not regarded as especially important. The revised regulations must be complementary to the biodiversity action plan and the habitats directive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para10"></a>Several noble Lords mentioned the question of soil erosion. A couple of years ago we were asked, as councillors in Somerset, to approve a sum of money for filter fences to prevent soil being washed on to the highway, thereby blocking drains and causing flooding to local houses. We visited the area and found that all the hedges had been removed or neglected. In addition, the pattern of ploughing had changed, so that where the earth had previously been retained by ploughing across the slope, and by hedges across the bottom of fields, those natural methods were no more. Instead, the council tax payer was expected to fund filter fences, which, being long strips of unsightly plastic which do not last for very long, are a far less effective and desirable method of soil retention than is a hedge. We are therefore looking closely at the economic arguments for the replacement of hedges.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para11"></a>One of the worst aspects of the 1997 regulations is the lack of emphasis given to the importance that hedgerows have in defining the character of a region. It is sometimes easy to tell where you are merely from the boundary system. I have mentioned the beech hedges of Exmoor, and noble Lords will be able to produce other examples. The hedges on high banks in Devon are fundamental to local distinctiveness. They are as much a part of the value of the landscape as the building materials that are used in the houses. Local authorities must produce local plans and policies that reflect local distinctiveness, and their residents may wish them to do so. But they may still not decide that a hedge is important simply because of its value as a landscape feature. The present national criteria do not empower local authorities to resist the breaking up of a traditional landscape of small fields; and many hedgerows do not fall into the important criteria as defined by the hedgerow regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para12"></a>What a strange set of criteria they are. If a hedge marks the boundary of a pre-1600 estate or manor, it is important; if it marks the boundary of a mid-18th century estate, possibly not. If it includes at least seven woody species, it is important; if it includes only five, possibly not--and so on. I support the view that the criteria should be simplified. Defining nationally what is important locally is not conducive to creating regulations that are coherent, easy to understand and easy to regulate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para13"></a>Because the previous government wished to remove any meaningful power from local authorities, they denied them the right to decide, preferring instead for Ministers to impose a set of regulations which, by common agreement in this debate, left much to be desired. If we compare them with what happens in the built environment, the Countryside Commission, now the Countryside Agency, promotes village design statements which enable local residents, in consultation with their local authority, to draw up a plan of exactly what they want to happen in their locality. That is a good way of ascertaining local views, and it could be widened to include local landscape.

<A NAME = "90428-10_para14"></a>Perhaps I may now turn to the subject of deterrence for those who fail to abide by the regulations. Again, the complicated nature of the regulations makes it extremely difficult for a local authority to bring a case. I commend Herefordshire County Council which was the first to discover a blatant act of destruction when a farmer, under cover of darkness, grubbed out half a mile of medieval hedge. He was heavily fined, and replacement costs for the hedgerow made the fine even greater. That might be termed a success. But the extremely detailed and painstaking work required by legal and conservation officers of that authority bear out the fact that local authorities may not always be able to consider pursuing a prosecution. The regulations must be made less complex so that flouting them becomes easier to discourage. Incidentally, hedgerows are the poor relation to trees. If you destroy a hedgerow, you pay a maximum fine of &#163;5,000, as opposed to &#163;20,000 for a tree. I therefore call on the Government to simplify the regulations and bring them into line with other planning procedures so that local people can be consulted and local authorities can make decisions that are in line with the wishes of local residents.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, no one, apart perhaps from the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, disputes that the existing legislation for ancient hedgerows is better than no legislation at all. Taken in conjunction with the amount of new planting that is going on, it may well be encouraging an approach that will benefit our countryside greatly over time. However, there seems little doubt that it could be improved. The NFU has stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"criteria that identify important hedgerows should be transparent, equitable and objective".
The problems that have been drawn to my attention by, for example, the Countryside Restoration Trust, the RSPB, the CLA, the NFU and the CPRE, suggest that further work is needed before "transparent, equitable and objective" legislation is introduced.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-10_para15"></a>Anyone who wishes to remove a hedge must notify the local authority. The local authority has six weeks in which to refuse permission. It has six weeks in which to examine the hedge, check its history and call for evidence of its importance. In particular, if the six weeks begin in the autumn just when furry mammals retire to sleep away the winter, perhaps when foliage is dying and many farmers and landowners give their hedges a short back and sides, it can be difficult to establish what a particular hedge shelters in the normal course of events.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para16"></a>I understand that the main study is usually a species count that is carried out on hedge lengths of 30 metres. If the hedge is less than 30 metres in length, the whole hedge is examined; if it is between 30 metres and 100 metres in length, the central 30 metres, which may include gaps such as gateways, are examined; if the hedge is between 100 metres and 200 metres in length, and is divided into two equal parts, the count is based on the central 30 metres in each part, the results being added together and divided by two; or, if it is over 200 metres in length, the hedge is divided into three <P>


<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>equal parts and the central 30 metres of each part are counted and averaged. It is no wonder that there is deep confusion about the present application of the regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para17"></a>It is possible for these counts to be made so that particular lengths are not examined. It is also possible to apply for permission to remove more than is intended, thereby weakening the result. Will the Minister consider extending the regulations so that the full length of hedgerow is involved in the count? Will she also consider amending the timetable so that applications to remove hedges must be made before, say, 1st April in any year, with the local authority having until 1st September to decide?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para18"></a>Historical data can save a hedge, but if that information is not already on file it must be adduced from sightings in the hedgerow at the time of the species count. Here, all the drawbacks of the suitability of the season and shortage of inspection time also apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para19"></a>No account is taken of the visual impact of the hedge, although I understand that for other purposes it is possible to commission a formal landscape assessment. Will the Minister consider changing the legislation to incorporate these assessments at least in areas of outstanding natural beauty?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para20"></a>I refer next to survey work carried out by Dr. Joe Crocker for an article in the Central Scientific Laboratory Science Review which implies that, at least in Herefordshire, the state of health of the bird population in cider orchards is more dependent on hedgerows than on pesticides and their application--the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, referred to this--and that the more overgrown the hedge, the greater the number of birds that it can sustain. Will the Minister take a close look at this research, perhaps with a view to restricting the frequency of hedge cutting?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para21"></a>Having said that, it is hardly fair to expect farmers to bear the continual cost of managing hedgerows and maintaining field boundaries--mention has also been made of dry stone walls--if they have no right at the same time to remove them when necessary. This becomes particularly important in those areas of the country where the Government propose to assert the right to roam or to institute new green open spaces. Will the Minister give earnest consideration to incorporating in the right to roam and the green spaces legislation a clause that requires the relevant authorities to pay the costs of maintaining boundaries in those designated areas? Such boundaries were devised originally to keep stock in and/or people out. On heath and moorland, it was mainly the latter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para22"></a>Many noble Lords have spoken today about wanting to look after hedgerows. However, as my noble friend Lord Stanley and other noble Lords have pointed out, it comes down to cost and profit. Noble Lords have debated farming in this House on many occasions and are aware that farmers are going through a tremendously difficult time. To impose upon them extra burdens and regulations, as the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, seeks to do, may be the very straw that breaks their back. If we want the kind of countryside of which the noble Lord speaks, the farming community must make a profit and compete <P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the global market, not just with other farmers in the UK. In earlier debates in this House we have considered animal welfare and "gold-plated" measures, the responsibility for which is placed on farmers by the Government. If we are not careful, the very things that the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, wants to do may well prove to be too much. That burden will make many of our farmers uncompetitive and therefore they will go to the wall.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para23"></a>My noble friend Lord Caithness referred to the general public's chocolate-box perception of the countryside. That perception of our countryside exists only because farmers farm the land. If that were not so, that perception would not exist. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn quite rightly pointed out that there could be more and better effective protection of our countryside if it included dykes, ditches, hedges and banks. I am sure all noble Lords in this House would agree with that. However, in the end, it comes back to money. In the past week in this House we had a very important debate on trade sanctions between the EU and the US. I was disappointed that the Government and the European Union had failed to come to grips with CAP reforms. I believe that we have missed a great opportunity and that this will pose difficulties for us in the future. Other noble Lords have pointed out that those who farm the countryside are stewards, but that they need to trade commercially in the world market.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para24"></a>Finally, I turn to another aspect of hedgerow protection that concerns me. My noble friend Lady Gardner has already touched on one aspect of this. Most hedgerows disappear through neglect, but a portion are dug up by property developers, demolished at the edge of rural land by keen gardeners or are destroyed by the former public utilities digging holes in the roads. No sooner have they finished than they return and dig up the road again. There is also the debilitating effect of the installation of cable television. All of those activities place a great strain on urban hedgerows. My noble friend Lady Gardner referred to leylandii. Will the Minister give consideration to the scope for regulations that bind the operations of some of the bodies to which I have referred in order to conserve one of the prime factors in the make-up of our green and pleasant land?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para25"></a>In conclusion, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, for giving us this opportunity to debate a subject that is so beneficial. We all want to see greater protection of hedgerows, but the money must come from somewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_time2"></A><H5>7.58 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Hardy of Wath for initiating this debate and drawing attention to the current arrangements for the protection of hedgerows. We have benefited from his longstanding interest and experience in the subject both here and in the Council of Europe. The noble Lord and others who have spoken today have expressed concern that the current arrangements may not be adequate to protect these defining features of our <P>


<a name="column_384"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>country's landscape which also serve as a habitat for animals and plants and provide important evidence as to the historic development of the landscape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para26"></a>As noble Lords have said, there are two main strands to the current arrangements. First, there are statutory controls on hedgerow removal in England and Wales under the Hedgerows Regulations 1997. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, presented the regulations to your Lordships' House for approval, admitting--the appropriate term, I think, having heard his views--that they were the last piece of business transacted under the previous administration. The noble Earl need not feel ashamed. Many noble Lords who have spoken are glad that he carried out that action.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para27"></a>Secondly, we encourage the planting, management and restoration of hedgerows through financial incentives which are available throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para28"></a>I must make clear at the outset that the Government are committed to providing strong and effective protection for hedgerows. To that end, we have taken positive steps to strengthen both the statutory framework and the management incentive schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para29"></a>As regards the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, the Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, announced in May 1997 that the system of protection in the regulations which were about to come into force would be subject to immediate review. The Government believed that early attention should be paid to those regulations because of concerns that the criteria, which local authorities must use to determine whether a hedgerow is important and therefore worthy of protection, were too complicated--a point raised in the debate--and did not protect enough hedgerows. At that time it was estimated that the regulations would catch only about one in five hedgerows. The period allowed for local authorities to respond was also raised. I shall refer to the issue of timing later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para30"></a>The review was carried out by a group which included the statutory agencies, local authorities and the main farming and conservation bodies. Its report, published in July last year, demonstrated a thorough investigation of the complex issues and careful analysis of possible options. Key recommendations included simpler criteria representing the landscape and the historic and wildlife importance of hedgerows. The review also proposed an increase in time allowed for response to a hedgerow removal notice from six to eight weeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-10_para31"></a>Before final decisions were taken on the group's proposals, however, it was recommended that research should be commissioned into the new criteria. In particular that would provide an estimate of the percentage of hedgerows the regulations would be likely to protect. We are currently studying the results of that research and expect to publish revised draft regulations for statutory consultation after the evaluation has been completed. Our deliberations will be informed by the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-11_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, when is that expected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I shall come to that in a moment. We hope by the summer. The law alone cannot provide full protection. For example, much hedgerow loss is due to hedges becoming derelict. It is difficult to legislate to prevent that. Incentive schemes, advice and information have a key role to play in encouraging active management of hedgerows. That is why, as a result of the comprehensive spending review, the Government have increased provision for agri-environment schemes in England. The sums available for the major schemes will be increased by &#163;40 million over the next three years,
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para0"></a>New funding of &#163;12.4 million (including running costs) will also be made available during the same period for Tir Gofal in Wales. That will be of enormous importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Hardy of Wath referred to the importance of hedgerows and their management. We agree that there is a problem with the over-management of hedgerows and neglect. We believe that the issue is addressed in part through free initial on-farm consultation advice and incentive schemes. The noble Lord, Lord Stanley, and the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, referred to the importance of the agricultural voice and the needs of the farming industry. Organisations such as ADAS, the farming wildlife advisory group and the countryside and agricultural information advisory service give advice on sympathetic management of field boundaries; and MAFF is also funding research into the attitudes of farmers and contractors to see how best we can deal with the issue of inappropriate management of the resource.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Middleton, and others raised the issue of cross-compliance, We agree that cross-compliance may be useful where environmental problems are directly related to agricultural activity, such as over-grazing. But our experience to date has been that such provisions can be costly and difficult to administer on a significant scale. Any further use of cross-compliance would need to take account of that earlier experience. We are considering all the options, including cross-compliance, in the light of the overall CAP agreement and the responses to the Minister of Agriculture's consultation exercise on Agenda 2000. Interested parties will have an opportunity to contribute their views on that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para3"></a>The possibility of new primary legislation on hedgerows was raised by my noble friend Lord Hardy and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn. We have not ruled out new primary legislation to secure stronger protection for important hedgerows in England and Wales. We shall reflect on the review group's suggestions that further consideration be given to altering Section 97 of the Environment Act 1995. My noble friend Lord Grantchester and other noble Lords referred to the CPRE report, Hedging Your Bets. We <P>


<a name="column_386"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have read with interest the results of the CPRE survey of local authorities on the operation of the current hedgerows regulations. It is important that we continue to work with the CPRE and other bodies which share our concern in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para4"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn, and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, referred to experience of the existing regulations. We believe that the hedgerows regulations need revising to provide stronger protection. Therefore we have not gathered data on how they are working in practice at present. The review group has worked with the Local Government Association on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, referred to the protection of hedgerows. Section 97 of the Environment Act contains the powers enabling Ministers to introduce regulations to protect important hedgerows in England and Wales. In particular, it confers on Ministers the responsibility for prescribing criteria which define what makes hedgerows important. Any approach which allows local authorities to determine which hedgerows in their area are important and worthy of protection would require amendment of the primary legislation. However, the noble Baroness's points are extremely valid and we shall consider them in detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para6"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Addison, referred to the valuable work undertaken by the national parks. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, spoke of the diversity of stone walls and hedgerows in our national parks. The point was well made. The Government will consider the need for legislative protection of all field boundaries in the light of forthcoming research, including up-to-date information on the state of field boundaries, when we receive the Countryside Survey 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para7"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop or Hereford and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, spoke in detail and with great knowledge about landscape value criterion and its importance. The review group spent some time grappling with that issue and found it difficult to identify a specific criterion to cover it but put forward some proposals such as a separate list of locally distinctive hedgerows. However, that tends to militate against the simple system which many speakers today stressed they would prefer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stanley, and the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, spoke of regulatory burdens on farmers. We shall seek to keep them to the necessary minimum, proportionate to the need to take account of research and consultation with other interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Hardy, and the noble Lords, Lord Stanley and Lord Middleton, spoke of the enclosure Acts. The Flamborough case suggested that obligations arising under the old enclosure Acts and awards may still be enforceable. It is extremely important for me to make the point that the obligations contained in the enclosure Acts and awards are enforceable as between private persons and are civil disputes. Neither the Government nor local authorities have a power to intervene or enforce on these matters. However, should there be further detailed information, I shall write to noble Lords.
<P>


<a name="column_387"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para10"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford and my noble friend Lord Grantchester spoke of the effect of the CAP subsidy on the environment. We are committed to pressing for radical reform of the subsidy system. We argued for a progressive reduction in production subsidy and in compensation paid to farmers and a switch towards paying for environmental goods. The reform measures agreed in Birmingham did not go as far as we would wish. We are currently consulting widely on how to implement the reforms and will take careful account of noble Lords' views, in particular those of the right reverend Prelate. We are working on a draft code of good agricultural practice for conservation. It would include advice and guidance on the protection of the environment in hedgerows.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para11"></a>In response to the issue of finance, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, among others, for England the additional &#163;40 million for the agri-environment fund is an important part of the Government's approach. It is the Government's clear objective to increase targeted payments for environmental projects.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, referred to the overall impression of the countryside. The Countryside Survey 2000 will provide the information we need to be aware of any changes, removal, planting, construction, replacement and dereliction. That is important. She also raised the issue of leylandii and other high hedges. We know that many people are affected by the problems which they can cause and feel strongly about the issue. We are sympathetic to those who suffer and are considering whether there is anything we should do to address the matter. We have not yet concluded whether any form of legislative action is to be taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para13"></a>As regards urban hedges and the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, the review group supported inclusion within the scope of the regulations garden hedges which adjoin countryside land uses. That would extend protection to potentially important hedgerows which mark historic boundaries between villages and open countryside. They are currently excluded under paragraph 3(3).
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para14"></a>I was asked about genetically modified crops and the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation is to address the concerns raised by English Nature and other bodies that the widespread introduction of some types of genetically modified crops could bring changes to the agricultural environment which could be damaging to farm life. The process will include an assessment of the impact of GM crops on field margins, including hedgerows. If there is evidence of harm the Government can act accordingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para15"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about local discretion over which hedges are important and the penalties. The maximum &#163;5,000 penalty refers only to cases brought before magistrates. For those heard in higher courts the fine is unlimited.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para16"></a>Progress is being made on hedgerow diversity action plans. The steering group set up to take forward the UK biodiversity action plan for ancient and/or species rich <P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>hedgerows met for a third time on 22nd April. All actions set out in the plan are being addressed. We will use on-going data to continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para17"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, with his introduction of the capercaillie, managed to worry me considerably by making me believe that I would have to answer two debates. However, his point was important because there is a connection. The deer fences to protect the woodland, which are being demanded by some environmentalists, are creating the problem for the capercaillie. I was reminded of previous Questions asked in your Lordships' House on red squirrels and the kind of trees they like.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para18"></a>The debate has shown the strength of feeling that the subject of hedgerow protection arouses as well as the complexity of the issues involved. Noble Lords from a strong farming and agricultural background, in particular the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, referred to the need for those involved in agriculture to act quickly and the possible destruction of things which are of value in order to prevent future problems. My limited experience of those whose lives and work centre around agriculture is that they are too committed to the environment to behave as vandals on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para19"></a>I conclude by saying that I shall write to all noble Lords who asked detailed questions to which I have been unable to reply in the time available. Like the noble Lord, Lord Stanley, I do not understand the changing language in agriculture. Whatever happened to mutton? I picked up his point about animals and, yes, sheep and lambs end up in butchers. But where has mutton gone? Again, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend the Minister. I shall read her substantial speech with interest tomorrow. I am sure that other noble Lords will also do so, and will recognise that she covered a substantial number of points very thoroughly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para20"></a>I shall not take long; indeed, I do not have long. But a number of points need to be made. First, I was particularly grateful to both right reverend Prelates. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford gave me great encouragement when I learnt of the efficiency of his local authority. I very much agreed with his comment about the need to support agriculture on an acreage rather than a headage basis. I first made a speech calling for that in the House of Commons 15 years ago. I hope, too, that my noble friend the Minister will pay particular attention to the approach made by her fellow Lancastrian, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para21"></a>I should like to make one or two points in my own defence in response to the noble Lord, Lord Stanley. He seemed to think that anyone with an interest in natural history and the countryside would be a townie who ought not to interfere in agriculture, but I should like to interfere in agriculture on behalf of many of the small farmers whom I represented for a very long time in the other place and who did not like the fact that a very tiny <P>


<a name="column_389"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proportion of farmers received a huge proportion of the very substantial sums that agriculture received from the public purse. They cannot be subsidised as heavily as they have been and be completely exempt from the consideration of the rest of the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para22"></a>The noble Lord seemed to be objecting to my point that people who own land were given the land on certain conditions, broke the conditions, may have been given subsidy by the taxpayer to act illegally in breaking those conditions, and then perhaps expect to receive grants to put right the wrong-doing for which they were subsidised. That is completely illogical.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para23"></a>I know that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, could not give way because of pressure of time, but he asked me a question, in effect. He seemed to suggest that I would have voted against the Enclosure Acts in the 18th and 19th centuries, if I had had the choice. No one with any knowledge of history could have objected to the enclosure Acts, because they were designed to ensure that food production massively increased in order to feed the burgeoning population in the industrial areas. The difference between that and hedgerow removal is that in the past 25 years we have been grubbing out hedgerows not to produce food to feed people, but to build surpluses at great cost. We have been destroying the natural history of Britain for no useful purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para24"></a>I also accept the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, that the hedgerow regulations were ridiculously complicated. I hope that the call for simplicity, which has been echoed throughout the debate, will receive proper attention from the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para25"></a>I was particularly grateful for comments from my noble friend Lord Grantchester and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, which reminded me of a grave omission from my speech. I should have declared an interest, being president of the Sheffield, South Yorkshire and Peak District branch of the CPRE, an honour that I accepted last year. I should have referred to it, although, apart from planting hedges in what was once upon a time my constituency, I have not been involved in its tremendous work on hedgerows, which has been proceeding for some time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para26"></a>As regards my own credentials, the noble Lord, Lord Stanley, may like to note that I come from the same community as the late Lord Williams of Barnburgh. He was a far better Minister of Agriculture than any of the distinguished Ministers of Agriculture produced from the other side. As a young man, I received enormous assistance from him, to the point that many of my constituents felt that I spent rather a disproportionate time seeking to assist and be on good terms with the farmers in the constituency that I was proud to represent.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-11_para27"></a>I may have lived in and represented a metropolitan area, but it was rich in fields, woods and natural features. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, referred to the inspiration that this provides. It is essential that that inspiration be available for future generations. I hope that the present Government will earn the regard not only of the present generation, but of many more as a result of their commitment to the green priorities which seem to be clear within the manifesto. I beg leave to withdraw my Motion for Papers.

<A NAME="90428-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para0"></a>This is a short Bill, and therefore this will be a short speech. The history of the Bill dates from when my noble friend Lord Addison asked an Unstarred Question on motorcycle parking places, on 2nd March 1998. The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, answered for the Government, saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"secure parking is a key concern ... The Government have declared that they will change the law when an opportunity arises to put beyond doubt the ability of local authorities to provide devices on the highways to which motorcycles can be attached."--[Official Report, 2/3/98; col. 953.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-12_para1"></a>The Government have been immensely helpful in enabling me to bring the Bill forward. I would be Machiavellian if I mentioned the need for more powered two-wheeler (PTW) places, or PTWs in bus lanes. That would be very rude of me, so I shall refrain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para2"></a>The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions said in A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone in 1998 that it would consider specific measures to assist motorcyclists, such as secure parking on public transport interchange sites--that is, park-and-ride. The Welsh Office guidance for local transport plans 1999 stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Another key factor for encouraging the use of powered two-wheelers is the provision of safe parking".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-12_para3"></a>There has been a considerable increase in sales of powered two-wheelers over recent years. In 1992 a survey of 400 motorcyclists in Bristol found that the lack of secure parking facilities was the issue of greatest concern to riders. Ninety-eight per cent said that they would be encouraged to use a lock if anchor points were available. A further survey in Sandwell, West Midlands, in 1998 found similar results. In 1991, against a backdrop of escalating levels of PTW thefts, the insurance companies raised motorcycle premiums by a high percentage.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para4"></a>There can be little doubt about the need for secure parking, and its incentive effect. Before Christmas last year I was fortunate enough to listen to a talk by the national association Bikers with Disability. One of the many support services it offers is engineering solutions to aid disabled bikers to modify PTWs to allow them to enjoy their freedom again. Imagine the severe disappointment that a disabled biker would suffer on the theft of his or her specially modified PTW. I apologise at this stage to the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, because I know how much he dislikes the term "PTW".
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para5"></a>Figures issued in January this year show once again a rise in thefts since 1997. It is estimated that around 25,000 motorcycles are stolen annually, with a recovery rate of 14 per cent, compared with the overall vehicle recovery rate of 65 per cent. I must declare an interest, for somewhere in those figures are two PTWs of mine that were "half-inched"--perhaps in your Lordships' House I should say "purloined".
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para6"></a>One of the most stunning of a plethora of ghastly PTW figures is the fact that PTW theft is seven times greater here than in Germany. London is the capital of PTW theft, with double the problem of any other country. These gloomy stories have a financial impact on us all. The extra cost in insurance premiums, police investigation costs and criminal justice fees is borne by us all. As I have said, I have had two PTWs stolen in London in the past four years. I am sure that the financial impact was not borne just by me.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para7"></a>I understand that all parties pledged support for PTWs in their general election manifestos and there is strong support on all sides for the Bill which I bring forward for its Second Reading today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para8"></a>Many local authorities are beginning to install PTW parking facilities and this Bill is designed to minimise the red tape and financial cost incurred by that red tape involved in installing secure PTW facilities. It seeks to clarify that grey area of the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para9"></a>This Bill amends Section 63 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 by merely authorising local authorities not only to provide stands and racks for bicycles but also for motorcycles. It does not interfere with any arrangements already made for bicycles.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para10"></a>It is as simple as that. The effect of the Bill is to give a small enlargement of existing powers to local authorities, but those new powers would be discretionary and there would be no obligation on the authorities to exercise them. The total expenditure of local authorities in consequence of the Bill is likely to be minimal. No effects are expected on public service manpower and it is expected that there will be a negligible impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies. I am extremely hopeful that this Bill will enable more PTWs to be secured successfully. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para11"></a>Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.--(Lord Rotherwick.)

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's Bill is concerned mainly with secure parking places for motorcycles, but bicycles are also slightly involved in the Bill and I want to make sure that cyclists' interests are not overlooked. I must declare an interest as someone who cycles between 2,000 and 3,000 miles per year, many of them on a tandem.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para12"></a>I half-support the Bill because, as regards congestion and pollution, motorcycles come half-way between cars and bicycles. The noble Lord will be aware that under the 1984 Act, authorities responsible for roads already have powers to provide racks and stands for bicycles. This Bill permits them to add securing devices.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para13"></a>There are some 15 million bicycles in this country and I welcome anything which encourages people to use them more. Identified and secure parking places are an additional encouragement. They remove the hassle of having to find a safe place. What is more, the bike is there when you get back and you are glad about that, because it is your only means of transport. Proper parking places are so much better than just leaving the <P>


<a name="column_392"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bicycle leaning up against a wall or a fence where it becomes both an obstacle and an eyesore. Proper parking places look much neater.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para14"></a>Therefore, I welcome the parts of the Bill which encourage cycling. The Government too are moving towards a pro-cycling culture. The White Paper on transport contains a policy commitment to double cycling by 2002 against a 1996 baseline. It is right that they should do so for two main reasons: first, less congestion and pollution, which directly aids the economy; and secondly, better health.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para15"></a>Indeed, in 1993, the Cyclists Touring Club, in its study Costing the Benefits estimated that the annual cost savings to the economy by increasing the level of cycle use by 10 per cent was more than &#163;1 billion. Therefore, substantial benefits are to be gained purely by using our cars less and our bicycles more.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para16"></a>I realise that an increase of 10 per cent bucks the national trend. However, the City of York increased bicycle use by 10 per cent in 1998 and at the same time reduced road deaths. Much of that was achieved by implementing the road safety strategy. So it is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para17"></a>Central to encouraging the greater use of bicycles is safety on the roads. For cyclists and pedestrians, our roads are some of the most dangerous in Europe. So I welcome the steps that are being taken to encourage speed reduction and reallocating carriageway space. The introduction of cycle lanes is welcome but, speaking personally, I believe that cyclists would feel far safer if they were separated from the rest of the traffic, not just by a white line or a different coloured surface but by a kerb raised from the road.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para18"></a>I turn now to the health aspects of cycling. First, health is not just the absence of disease; it is also the presence of vigour, fitness and the ability to work. You perform better if you are fitter and you are less likely to be ill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para19"></a>The Health Education Council recommends physical activity because research has determined that there is a relationship between physical activity and a reduced risk of a number of diseases. For example, cycling for between six and eight hours per week can bring about an important reduction in the risk of fatal heart disease which is the nation's biggest killer. People are aware of that. That is why many people go to health clubs three times per week and sit on a stationary cycle, often watching television. How much more creative and constructive it must be to use that time to actually cycle to and from work or to and from the station or to and from the shops or to visit friends and family.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para20"></a>Incidentally, I find that one of the major advantages of using a bicycle in an urban environment is that you know exactly how long a journey will take. On a bicycle, you are hardly affected by roadworks or traffic jams, so you can be more certain of your journey time. Cycling does not require any arrangements. You do not have to think about where to park the car. Cycling to and from places takes quite a lot of hassle out of life. Anything which takes stress out of life is to be welcomed.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para21"></a>My main point is that travelling in that way makes exercise part of your lifestyle. Regular exercise then just happens as a part of your normal way of life. That is why I support the Bill: because it is good for the economy and good for health. Who would not want to help the economy and to improve their health at the same time?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para22"></a>I have known the Minister for many years. I know him to be entirely reasonable. How can any reasonable person fail to be influenced by the force of those arguments? Who could not be in favour of improving the economy and improving their health? So I can envisage the Minister cycling from his home in London to his office in Victoria, which is not very far, and then cycling from his office in Victoria to Westminster, which is an even shorter distance. What is more, there are no hills on either journey.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para23"></a>The Chancellor is also encouraging the Minister to use his bicycle as he has raised the tax-free allowance for cyclists on business to 12p per mile. The Minister's department could provide him with a bicycle tax free. That is some encouragement to use the ministerial car less.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para24"></a>I hope that the Minister will support the Bill. I hope that he will ensure that local authorities are offered the appropriate funding to deliver on the Government's policy commitments regarding cycling. I hope, too, that his department will use its influence to ensure that cycling arrangements are incorporated into the plans of public transport providers and that cycling becomes part of the integrated transport system. In that way, cycling will become a real travel option for us all, and we shall all enjoy the benefits.

<A NAME="90428-12_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, I am strongly in favour of this modest proposal. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for bringing it forward. This afternoon I have come from a meeting of West Midlands bishops at a retreat in Worcestershire. Today I travelled from Hereford to Worcester and on to London by train. But yesterday, I made the journey from Hereford to the meeting and back again on my Honda VFR 750, and very exhilarating and quick it was. However, I parked the bike with some misgiving in the car park of the retreat house. I threw it a lingering and affectionate look as I walked into the house because I did not know whether I would see it again. Nowhere, not even on such hallowed ground, is a bike safe. The statistics are appalling. Like the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, I have been a victim. I fear the debate will be rather anecdotal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para25"></a>Four years ago, for a few heady months, I was the proud owner of a Suzuki GSXR 750. It was double locked in the palace garage and was stolen, together with my daughter's boyfriend's Honda, in broad daylight at 5 o'clock on a weekday afternoon. The thieves had planned their raid very cleverly, bringing in their anonymous van at a time when numbers of plumbers and carpenters were moving in and out and one more Transit van would go unnoticed. I never saw or heard anything more of my beloved bike. I suppose <P>


<a name="column_394"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should have seen it as some kind of judgment on me, at my advanced years and in my serious calling, wanting what is an archetypal hooligan bike. The fact is, I still feel it, like a bereavement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para26"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, two-wheelers are altogether desirable. Bicycles are healthy and non-polluting. Motorcycles are quick, convenient and cause amazingly little congestion. Eight motorcycles can be parked in the same space as one motorcar. However, worries about security are a serious problem. They are a significant deterrent to many who would otherwise use a two-wheeler.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para27"></a>For pedal cycles, the need is for cycle racks to be in a prominent place in full view, easily visible. I believe that most cyclists are perfectly happy to carry a chain and lock, but those are inevitably not very sophisticated devices. Bicycles can easily be dismembered even if the frame is locked to the rack. I remember going to Hereford station recently on my own bicycle and being slightly alarmed to find, in the next rack to where I was putting my bike, a frame chained to the rack. Every other component had been removed. So, I caught the train with some sense of misgiving. Mercifully, my bike was intact when I returned. It seems to me that what matters is that if we are providing bicycle racks for pedal cycles, they should be in an obvious place and not like the one at Hereford station tucked away where no one can see it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para28"></a>Motorcycles require rather different treatment. Ground anchors of some kind are the only answer to the ruthless, highly-organised gangs of thieves. Many forms of suitable anchor are available from the high-tech Bikesafe bollard operated by a smart card and requiring payment per hour to the simpler, cheaper but equally effective steel rails, bars or loops to which a motorcycle can be secured. This requires the motorcyclist to carry a very substantial heavy-duty chain or locking device. With a sizeable bike, that is probably not a difficulty, but for riders of small, lightweight bikes it may be quite impractical to carry a suitable locking device. Therefore, I believe we urgently need, in every town and city, some secure parking of the Bikesafe/smart card kind which provides all the necessary equipment on site.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para29"></a>I hope the message will go very clearly from this brief debate and that the security interests of motorcyclists will be taken much more seriously for the benefit of those of us who are bikers and because of the environmental benefit for the common good.

<A NAME="90428-12_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may declare an interest, as a motorcycle licence-holder, an owner of a motorcycle and subscriber of annual funds to a motorcycle insurance company for the privilege. I am also a member of the All Party Motorcycle Group. Perhaps I may add that I have had my motor cycle knocked over while parked in the Palace of Westminster. That set up a concertina effect, damaging not only my own motorcycle but also that of my noble friend Lord Rotherwick. I am pleased, therefore, that the Bill gives powers to authorities to provide, among other measures, stands or racks to enable the bicycle to be held in a stable, upright position while it is parked.
<P>


<a name="column_395"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para30"></a>To be serious, this Bill is long overdue. We have heard of the numbers of motorcycles stolen, literally picked up off the streets. Any measure that helps to secure a motorcycle to its surroundings must be of benefit to all, except the thief. Lately, I have been interested to note that motorcycle magazines have published a kind of Which report on locking and securing equipment for motorcycles. Those useful reports have highlighted the various strengths and weaknesses of available restraints, which is helpful to both owners and insurance companies alike.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para31"></a>Many insurance companies offer discounts if certain alarms or devices are fitted, but there is not much to beat the heavy-duty lug in the road through which a serious section of chain can be passed. I trust that the Bill will enable authorities to be helpful to motorcycle owners who have no garage or garden frontage at home and that they will allow some flexibility in providing or supporting the fitting of lugs in suitable places outside the owner's home. Perhaps the Minister would respond to that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para32"></a>Also, I should like to see flexibility in car parks, such as NCP car parks, to accept motorcycles. We have heard the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford speak about the fact that eight motorcycles can be parked in one car parking place. I do not see why the NCP car parks or other car parks feel that they losing revenue by allowing motorcycles to be parked there or why they cannot provide bays for motorcycles. Many owners would be only too pleased to pay for covered accommodation for their motorcycles and thereby reduce the risk of theft.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para33"></a>I commend the Bill to the House and support my noble friend Lord Rotherwick.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-12_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, this is a useful Bill which provides a very simple aid to those who ride pedal cycles as well as motorcycles. I should, of course, declare an interest like everybody else. I am the rider of a motor scooter, and therefore the provision of racks, stands and devices for securing bicycles or motorcycles at the roadside would be of benefit to me. Scooters provide a cost-effective and convenient means of transport and are becoming more popular as traffic densities worsen. I shall listen with some care to how the Minister replies to his noble friend Lord Haskel as to what he proposes to do with his ministerial car on his way home.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para34"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, outlined in introducing the Bill, it is the ability to secure a bicycle, or particularly a motorcycle, to something solid that is absent in most instances. I wish to concentrate this evening on problems connected with motorcycles. Local authorities in London have provided a good number of spaces for the parking of solo motorcycles at the roadside and they are very well used. However, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford identified, there are problems with security. The most helpful <P>


<a name="column_396"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Explanatory Notes which accompany the Bill go right to the heart of the matter. Page 2 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "motor cycles are vulnerable to theft by persons who can lift the whole vehicle and remove it in a van or lorry. The Bill thus provides for devices that secure motor cycles."
It continues:
<P>
<BR>
"these devices could be in the form of a bar to which a motor cycle could be chained or tethered".
There you have it--simple and very cost-effective. The motorcycle trade reports a substantial increase in the number of motor cycles, especially scooters, sold this year and so the Bill is very timely.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-12_para35"></a>The cost of installing such devices would not be substantial but would have to be covered from the general rate. The concept of individual meters or some form of parking ticket is not practical for a motorcycle for on-street parking. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, that some arrangements could be made for charging for off-street parking. As the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, stated, the new powers contained in the Bill are discretionary and local authorities must judge for themselves the need for these devices.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para36"></a>The Explanatory Notes recognise that the cost to local authorities would be minimal. Motorcyclists would benefit from reduced insurance premiums if these bars were fitted in the pavement, particularly in residential areas where motorcycles are parked overnight or over a weekend. Some scooters even have a built-in safety chain for that purpose. It could be seen as a useful crime prevention exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para37"></a>What would also be most useful to motorcyclists is the provision of some form of map that would show where the parking places for solo motorcycles are located. Not every street has them and therefore it often requires driving up and down streets in the neighbourhood of one's destination in order to happen on a parking place. They are often tucked away in side streets, and not obvious from a glance up the street.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para38"></a>If the local authority goes to the expense of providing the security bars in the pavement it would be very convenient if they could also provide a map of where they are. I am sure that sponsorship would pay for the printing of the map in any local authority area, and perhaps the noble Lord the Minister could say whether he would encourage local authorities to provide this information in the way that I have suggested. I realise, of course, that the demand for the maps would be relatively small, but I am sure it would assist the air quality of the area by reducing the amount of time spent driving around looking for these spaces. All in all, this is a useful modification to Section 63 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, and I believe that your Lordships should give this Bill a fair wind.

<A NAME="90428-12_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, I should like to join in the congratulations paid to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, on originating this small and modest Bill, and to those offered to the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, who, together with the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, was responsible for raising the subject in your Lordships' House originally.

<A NAME = "90428-12_para39"></a>I must declare an interest, as chairman of the Motorcycle Industry Theft Action Group, which has been in existence now for seven or eight years and which was set up to address the problem of motorcycle theft. Motorcycle theft at that time had reached such proportions that insurers were no longer willing to write policies for motorcycle riders; certainly not new policies. The effect that that would have had on motorcycle sales would have been dire indeed; so something had to be done about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para40"></a>We drew into the Motorcycle Industry Theft Action Group all those who had some interest or some expertise in this matter. They included, obviously, the Home Office, the police, the insurers, various motorcycle groups and others. I think that we can claim to have been successful in quite a short time, not only by bringing in the help of, in particular, the Metropolitan Police Stolen Vehicles Squad, which worked very closely with us, but also by involving the Association of Chief Police Officers and creating some kind of awareness of the danger faced by motorcyclists if they are not properly protected. They have to be made aware of the dangers of leaving motorcycles where they could be stolen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para41"></a>Of course, if you are like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford and you choose a bike that thieves find most desirable, you have a particular problem. I would say to the right reverend Prelate that there are some quite simple measures that one can take in addition to locking up motorcycles, even when there are not the kinds of parking places that we are discussing. Perhaps I may suggest to him that a very old canvas cover could be used. Thieves, by their very nature, are lazy people and they tend not to look under covers. However, if they have targeted your motorcycle beforehand and have made an organised effort, your cover will not protect it. But, generally speaking, I have discovered that an old cover is very effective, in addition to all the other devices that we put on to motor cycles.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para42"></a>The parking situation at the moment is very worrying indeed. The Bill provides for local authorities to provide further encouragement, although I do not think it is any more than that. Perhaps when the Minister replies he will tell us more precisely what effect this Bill will have--because I do hope that it has a chance of getting on the statute book--in terms of ensuing local authority action.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para43"></a>Even in the London area it is necessary, if you wish to avoid the unpleasant surprise of finding a parking ticket on your motorcycle, to find out what particular local authority laws apply to motorcycles. I think it is fair to say that in the past some criticism has been extended, from both sides of your Lordships' House, to the local borough of Wandsworth. However, in one way it is a model in this area. It provides excellent motorcycle parking; just the thing that is suggested by the noble Lord in this Bill. In addition, it allows motorcyclists to park on spaces, whether they are spaces for residents or spaces with meters. However, it will not, of course, allow motorcyclists to park on yellow lines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para44"></a>If you are a new motorcyclist and you move down the road to the borough of Lambeth, let us say, or to Wimbledon, you may think that the same thing would <P>


<a name="column_398"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>apply; but it does not. It is necessary to find a friendly parking warden. They are often friendly to motorcyclists because they themselves more often than not use what are known as powered two-wheelers. Incidentally, I prefer the term "powered two-wheelers" to the acronym "PTWs", but perhaps both are slightly offensive and rather long-winded. However, most parking wardens have had some contact with motorcyclists and are willing to explain what the local regulations are.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para45"></a>Indeed, I was told in Wimbledon--this is a strange one--that in that authority one was not permitted to park a motorcycle unless it was parallel to the kerb because it provided no obstruction to traffic in that way. That is an odd one and I have never heard of it anywhere else. It is a curious thing, but there is no standard approach taken by local authorities, either as to what is permissible by way of motorcycle parking or what is supplied for motorcyclists by way of "fixings", as is suggested in this modest Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para46"></a>If you go to other countries in Europe, and to France in particular, people are not so fussy about where you park a motorcycle. The police will not interfere; nor will parking wardens, if motorcycles are not causing an obstruction. They also provide very high-quality fixings, should you choose to use them. In this country, there has always been an underlying attitude about motorcyclists which does not exist in other European countries. In some local authorities, certain engineers, who are responsible after all for some of the decisions taken with regard to motorcycles, may to some extent be anti-motorcycle. They consider them to be a nuisance. That is not unknown in Britain. Motorcyclists are either seen as ruffians or eccentrics--certainly, Peers are seen as eccentrics--and so there is a kind of cultural attitude to be overcome. I hope that with motorcycles, including scooters, increasingly being used on the roads, that attitude will be broken down.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para47"></a>The advent of large numbers of scooters has aggravated the parking problem of motorcycles considerably. It is very difficult now, if you have a big motorcycle, to get on to one of the designated spaces, of which there are not nearly enough. Also, people are rather selfish about where they park. They often park obliquely in a space which might otherwise allow a motorcycle to be parked there also. Some motorists park rather carelessly, something of which motorcyclists must become aware.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para48"></a>Some innovative thinking will be required from local authorities with regard to paying for parking space improvements. Not only could they advertise in the area concerned in order to generate some income--that should not be difficult because, for a modest fee, garages selling motorcycle spares and clothing would be glad to advertise--but, in addition, they could provide helpful advice on parking, which would introduce good manners; and good manners are very much needed in our society in many areas. I shall say no more about motorcyclists except that I welcome the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para49"></a>On cyclists, I was interested in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, particularly because I am a cyclist as well as a motorcyclist. In recent weeks I have become <P>


<a name="column_399"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more of a cyclist because my doctor told me that I had to lose weight. I take doctors very seriously because I do not see them often, and I have been cycling around London and losing weight very quickly. I feel a lot better for it. I am sure that everything my doctor said was absolutely right and that people should be encouraged to cycle.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para50"></a>But cycling in London is a very exciting business. I get more thrills cycling in London than I ever got on a motorcycle. I cannot understand how some people are so brave and foolhardy as to wear things like Sony Walkmans when they are on cycles, which means they cannot hear the traffic around them. I am amazed by the bravery of young women in particular, who cross the road on cycles with verve and flair with scarcely a look around them. It is an extraordinary experience and I am enjoying it very much. We should do more cycling.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para51"></a>Today I encountered just the kind of situation which was pointed out earlier. It was extremely difficult to find a space to park my cycle in Holborn where there are cycle spaces, but not nearly enough. I had to park my cycle on a post which told people about the length of time they are allowed to park cars. When I came back, the cycle was where I had left it. It did not have a ticket on it, but I had felt uneasy leaving it there when I went to my meeting. One is terribly inhibited on a cycle and is often left to fasten it to railings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para52"></a>When the Minister replies, perhaps he can tell us something about the position of cyclists who use railings, posts and other fixings on which to attach their cycles. There are some alarming notices around. One read, "If you put your cycle against these railings, it will be removed or destroyed". What is so special about railings? Why are people so worried about cycles on their railings? I do not understand that. The cycles are often more attractive than the railings. But it is perhaps one of our British traits to say: "We do not like cyclists. We do not like their clothes, their lycra shorts" and so forth--and that has a knock-on effect on the way we view our railings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para53"></a>Life is as difficult for cyclists as it is for motorcyclists. There is a kind of war between the two groups and I find myself in the middle. When I am on a cycle, I dislike motorcyclists and when I am on a motorcycle, I dislike cyclists. But again, that is a British trait. We are all members of groups, clubs or parties and we hate everybody who is not part of our group. As I get older, I am trying to be more fair and even-handed with everybody and I hope that everybody will follow my example. I hope that I do not lose my temper tomorrow with a cyclist when I am on my motorcycle!
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para54"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, gave an excellent speech and I hope that it is reproduced elsewhere. That will encourage more people to use cycles and to improve their health. I look forward to what the Minister has to say and hope that he will be able to tell us that this Bill will have a fair wind. We all know that it is difficult to get Private Member's Bills on to the statute book, but this Bill would provide enormous encouragement for people and local authorities. It would also have a knock-on effect. It would start to break down the cultural attitudes against motorcycles in particular. <P>


<a name="column_400"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The orderly parking of motorcycles would make motorcyclists themselves more orderly and more acceptable. Many things could be achieved. I look forward to the Minister's remarks.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I shall not attempt to repeat the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. On a modest Bill like this 13 minutes was a triumph!
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para55"></a>We welcome this Bill from these Benches. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Rotherwick on having introduced it. I find it hard to understand why it is necessary. After all, it has very modest aims. As far as I can see, practically speaking, it merely requires local authorities to put up rather stronger posts than they do at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para56"></a>I take note of what the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said; that is, that it also improves the situation of cyclists. I am the first speaker so far--perhaps the Minister will be another--who has no interest to declare. I am not a cyclist, nor a motorcyclist. I do possess a motorcycle licence which I obtained when I was 16--one was allowed to have one in those days, which is quite a long time ago--but I do not now drive a motorcycle and do not ride a pedal cycle either.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para57"></a>I am a pedestrian in London; I am a user of the Tube and the bus and I am a motorist. As the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, said, one has to change one's allegiance as one uses the different forms of transport. As a pedestrian I dislike cyclists intensely. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, is an exception to the rule, but mostly they ride on the pavements; they go on the wrong side of traffic bollards; they nearly knock you down as you are crossing the road; they disregard pedestrian crossings; they go the wrong way up one-way streets, and do all sorts of other things which, as a pedestrian, one finds thoroughly objectionable. As a motorist, of course, I make it my business to try and knock over as many of them as I possibly can--or at least I think I should do that but I never get around to doing it. However, that is what is in the back of my mind and, I hope, will never come to the front of my mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para58"></a>Motorcyclists in London, unfortunately, are somewhat tarnished by the reputation of the couriers who behave in much the same way as cyclists. I am sure no noble Lord would be tempted to behave in that way, but noble Lords who are cyclists must agree that they taint the reputation of bikers generally. I use the word "biker"; I am glad that the Bill says, "motorcycles". It does not say, "powered two-wheelers" or "PTWs", otherwise I could not support the Bill, unlike the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para59"></a>However, the courier fraternity could be taught a lot, and not only the courier fraternity who generally tend to ride the larger bikes, but the pizza delivery fraternity. They tend to ride the smaller bikes around London and look extremely perilous. I suppose it is mostly their own fault that they get knocked over, but it is not something one would wish to emulate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-12_para60"></a>However, having said that, I noted that the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, described bikers as generally either "ruffians" or "eccentrics". I am sure that that is <P>


<a name="column_401"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not the case. Moreover, I believe that my noble friend Lord Rotherwick said that 25,000 motorbikes are stolen each year. To my mind, that means that there are 25,000 motorbikers out there who have bought stolen vehicles. So, presumably, not all motorcyclists are perfect in that sense. Perhaps the fraternity should look to itself to a certain extent. I give way to the noble Viscount.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-13_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is most gracious to give way. There are, of course, many stolen motorcycles, or indeed parts of them, which get into circulation. However, in all fairness to motorcyclists, I think that those who buy motorcycles with "pirated" parts, if I may put it that way, are often unaware that that is the case. As with motorcars, it is very difficult to check whether the vehicle or parts of it have been stolen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I certainly take the noble Viscount's point, but there must be some vehicles which are recirculated by unscrupulous buyers who know that they are stolen. Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister will be able to give it a fair wind.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may first thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for introducing the Bill. It will tackle a gap in the regulations and I believe that it will be of great benefit to all of us if passed. I am delighted to say to the noble Viscount and others that the Government support the Bill and were able to agree that parliamentary counsel should help the noble Lord produce the legislation. However, I fear that the basic workload will still fall upon the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. The noble Lord has shown great energy and commitment in bringing forward the Bill. I am very much appreciative of his effort.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para0"></a>The Government hope very much that the Bill will succeed. If, by some mischance, it fails, either in this or the other place, I reiterate the Government's commitment to ensure that legislation along similar lines will be pursued. Therefore, we are fully in favour of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para1"></a>I have nevertheless to address a few problems. A cultural issue seems to be involved, which was perhaps best explained by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. There are images, reality, and behavioural and safety problems involved with motorcyclists and indeed with cyclists. I have often found it necessary to remark that similar bad behaviour is quite frequent among car drivers who in fact cause the vast majority of accidents. It is true, however, that cyclists and motorcyclists are vulnerable. Motorcycling is often not a very safe means of transport. But it is part of our transport system and one which many people prefer, especially in crowded urban areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para2"></a>I should declare a complete non-interest in the sense that I have never been up front on a motorcycle; indeed, I have been utterly terrified as a pillion passenger on such a vehicle. I do not intend to alter that position. Moreover, I am rarely a cyclist. I shall respond in a moment to my noble friend Lord Haskel.
<P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para3"></a>There are other cultural problems. But motorcycling is an important part of our urban transport system and indeed of our long distance transport system. It should be catered for better. Drivers of all modes of transport should demonstrate the kind of tolerance and reasonableness mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. Some of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, reminded me that I am the Minister with responsibility for road safety and that I should deeply deplore what he said. However, he did pull back from the implications of his attitude when driving certain modes of transport.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para4"></a>The Bill builds upon the White Paper which we produced and to which my noble friend Lord Haskel referred in relation to cycling. However, a big chunk of that integrated transport policy related to motorcycling. We recognise that motorcycling can, in many circumstances, make a contribution to the objectives of integrated transport. We have been persuading local authorities to consider introducing in their local transport plans facilities for encouraging motorcycling, in particular by providing secure parking.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para5"></a>Before I continue further in the motorcycling direction, I believe that I need to respond to my noble friend Lord Haskel; indeed, I have been pondering on how to do so, especially as regards his more pointed remarks. I agree with my noble friend's general points, but when his remarks became directed at me I began to feel slightly uncomfortable. I can assure him that the Government are absolutely dedicated to increasing the degree of cycling.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para6"></a>I travel around the country pointing out to people that many car journeys comprise less than two miles and that most able-bodied people could quite easily walk or cycle such distances. That is an important part of our policy. Indeed, we have endorsed the aim of the national cycling strategy of reversing the decline in cycling and doubling the number of cycle trips by the year 2002--and doubling them again by the year 2012. It is a pretty ambitious aim. However, that kind of turnaround has already been achieved in one or two urban areas. We have supported cycling bodies in that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para7"></a>To achieve those targets, it might be incumbent upon Ministers to make some contribution. I am sure that the whole House will be sympathetic to my following remarks. Ministers are not averse to more healthy forms of transport but, unfortunately, the electronic age has not yet arrived for us. We are therefore obliged to carry huge boxes of mail from your Lordships and others around with us at all times. I try to walk to my office in the mornings and my driver follows me around with the red boxes. Therefore I contribute to my own health but not to the health of some others in the community. That matter should be addressed, but I cannot give a clear answer tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para8"></a>There are serious aspects. The noble Viscounts, Lord Ullswater and Lord Falkland, referred to motorcycle crime. As the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, pointed out, there are victims of such crime in this House. It is estimated that 25,000 motorcycles are stolen annually. Some 86 per cent of them are not recovered. As has been said, many are cannibalised, resulting in illegal motorcycles being on the streets. That poses problems for law enforcement and road safety.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para9"></a>Safer, more secure parking would make a major contribution not only in encouraging motorcyclists to use their machines responsibly, but also in making them feel secure in so doing. The lack of secure parking facilities for motorcycles is probably a major factor in the high level of motorcycle theft. This Bill addresses the issue and gives local authorities new powers. Until now they have not had such powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, asked why the Bill is necessary. It is necessary because local authorities require powers before they can do anything. At present they do not have those powers. Clause 1 of the Bill seeks to address that problem and to amend Section 63 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 which deals only with stands and racks for pedal cycles. We are now extending the provision to motorcycles. I refer in this regard to the ground anchors mentioned by the right reverend Prelate and to the more sophisticated devices which we hope to see provided in the future. Certainly, we shall encourage local authorities to use these powers and to provide such facilities in their own car parks. I say to the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, that only local authorities will have this power under the Bill. But in a sense it is only local authorities' lack of such a power that we have to address. Clearly, private operators can already provide such facilities on their own land.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para11"></a>However on-street parking facilities are the responsibility of local authorities. As regards individuals parking outside their own homes, local authorities would need to introduce an order on motorcycle parking under the regulations. That would enable them to install secure parking devices. However, that does not apply to an individual in regard to providing his own off-street parking facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para12"></a>We have given much support to local authorities to develop their policies for motorcyclists. The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, said that, by and large, the motorcycling fraternity does not believe that local authorities are particularly helpful to it. Many local authorities have provided facilities for motorcyclists but more could be provided for both cyclists and motorcyclists.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para13"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, asked about providing maps. We are happy to encourage local authorities to do that and to encourage a public/private partnership as commercial map makers may also be interested. Cycling and motorcycling organisations may be interested in distributing such information to their members. In some cities information is already made available. Exeter, Cambridge, Gloucester and York provide such information, together with other facilities, for motorised and non-motorised two-wheeled vehicles.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para14"></a>I should make clear that the Bill is an enabling measure. There is no obligation on local authorities to provide secure parking.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para15"></a>We are devolving responsibilities in other areas of transport policy, and indeed other policies, to local authorities. The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, indicated a lack of common approach between local authorities. That will continue to be the case. We are simply giving local authorities powers which they can now use. <P>


<a name="column_404"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nevertheless, I suspect that both the facilities and the by-laws will continue to be different where they are part of devolved local democracy. We are trying to remove barriers in order that local authorities may provide the facilities dealt with in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para16"></a>The noble Viscount raised the question of whether cyclists should be discouraged, as they occasionally are, from chaining their bikes to railings. It varies from area to area but, by and large, railings are the property of the landowner. An additional problem in the Westminster area, one has to admit in this day and age, is that of security. Many of the heavy notices relate to security problems in the Metropolis.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para17"></a>The Bill may result in a relatively small increase in expenditure for authorities which take advantage of its powers. In general it will be a small installation cost, which they may be able to recover by charging for parking. However, that is very much a matter for the local authorities themselves. The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure more secure parking for both cyclists and motorcyclists.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para18"></a>I wish to thank all noble Lords who have spoken. If I have missed any points I shall write to noble Lords in the normal way. I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for producing the Bill. I assure him, once again, of government support. We have bikers and cyclists around the House of all parties--including a biking Bishop. There is truly cross-party and ecumenical support for the provisions of the Bill. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, once again and thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken and especially for the kind and supportive words that I have heard this evening. I am aware that the Bill is not guaranteed of success and I shall continue to canvass for it in another place. I am sympathetic to the noble Lord, Lord Haskel. As an ex-biker I can quite understand his excitement about bicycling, although I am not quite sure whether I misheard him when he said he thought that bicycling takes the "Haskel" out of life. On the other hand, I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, about the thrills that I can remember as a bicyclist.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para19"></a>If it is of any help to my noble friend Lord Brabazon, some time ago we listened to the Courier Association, which has a very strong code of practice that it imposes upon all its motorcycling members. I should also tell him that the stolen vehicle statistics I received from the Metropolitan Police state that in 10 years 1.5 million unrecovered stolen vehicles will be used on our roads either as complete vehicles or as part or parts of other vehicles. That is quite an astounding statistic.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para20"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, would like to accept a lift from me, I would be very happy to drive him around London while his red boxes follow closely behind, if they can keep up. Finally, I ask that the House give the Bill a Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-13_para21"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burlison </B>   rose to move, That the draft laid before the House on 25th March be approved [16th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the alterations is to add additional injury descriptions to the tariff of injuries set out in the criminal injuries compensation scheme. This would enable the body which administers the scheme--the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority--to settle some 240 outstanding claims for compensation whose injuries are not currently listed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para1"></a>By way of background, I should explain briefly that the scheme provides payment from public funds to blameless victims of crimes of violence and those injured in trying to apprehend criminals or prevent crime. The original scheme was introduced in 1964. It was non-statutory. Compensation was assessed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board on the basis of common law damages.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para2"></a>The terms of the original scheme were modified from time to time. But the scheme was changed more fundamentally with effect from 1st April 1996, when it was placed on a statutory footing following the passage of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para3"></a>The new scheme broke the link with common law damages. It moved away from payment based on individual assessment and provided for payment to be made on the basis of a tariff of awards that grouped together injuries of comparable severity and allocated a financial value to them. The new tariff-based scheme is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Appeals against decisions made by the authority are considered by an independent appellate body, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para4"></a>Applications lodged before 1st April 1996 are being cleared by the board under the rules of the old scheme. Nearly 110,000 cases were outstanding at that time. That figure has now been reduced to around 12,000, most of them appeals cases. The target is to clear these cases by 31st March 2000, when the board will be wound up. Until then the old and new schemes will continue to run in parallel.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para5"></a>It might be helpful if I reminded your Lordships that the tariff was set by reference to some 20,000 awards made previously by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. There are some 330 injury descriptions in the tariff of injuries, ranked against 25 levels of awards, ranging from &#163;1,000 to &#163;250,000. All successful claimants get an award from the tariff. However, victims who are more seriously affected by their injury can receive additional payment for loss of earnings and the costs of special care. And, in fatal cases, additional payment can also be made to those who were dependent on the victim's income and for the cost of replacing a deceased parent's services.
<P>


<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para6"></a>Since the tariff scheme was introduced in 1996, more than 140,000 claims have been settled under its terms. But some 240 claims cannot be settled because, although the injuries are serious enough to qualify for at least the minimum award, the injuries are not currently listed in the tariff. It was, of course, always recognised that the original tariff could not hope to be fully comprehensive. It was inevitable that some less common injuries would be inadvertently omitted, or that some injury descriptions would need to be changed or modified in the light of experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para7"></a>The tariff scheme accordingly provides for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to consult the appeals panel and then to propose to the Secretary of State a new injury description and corresponding award level. If the Secretary of State is content, he then invites Parliament to approve the necessary changes to the scheme by the affirmative resolution procedure. That is the process we are following here today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para8"></a>In the meantime, the scheme also provides that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority can pay an interim award of up to half the amount recommended. It has done so in 230 of the 240 outstanding cases. Having consulted the appeals panel, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority has recommended to the Secretary of State the addition of 49 injury descriptions to the tariff of injuries. To facilitate identification, these are highlighted in bold in the tariff appended to the explanatory note, which is otherwise identical to the augmented tariff for which approval is being sought. In our view, all the additions proposed are justified and necessary and the recommended award levels are appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para9"></a>Given the need to augment the tariff in this way, and mindful of pressures on the parliamentary timetable, we have also taken this opportunity to invite Parliament to approve some other, minor changes to the tariff of awards. The changes would make the tariff more consistent in its use of language and punctuation. These are minimalist changes. They are purely presentational and have no other effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para10"></a>No other changes have been made to the tariff of awards. All existing injury descriptions and award levels have been left unaltered. The rules of the scheme have also been left unchanged. That only serves to emphasise the very limited nature of this exercise. Our sole aim is to enable the 240 outstanding claims to be settled.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para11"></a>The changes that we are proposing would, if approved by this House, come into effect tomorrow, having already received approval in another place. They would apply to applications whenever made, provided that no final award had been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para12"></a>I could well understand it if some noble Lords wanted to take this opportunity to suggest that other changes might be made to the scheme. We should, of course, always be interested to hear views on this. However, this is not the time to debate such matters or, indeed, any other points relating to the scheme. As some of your Lordships will know, the Government launched a public consultation exercise on the scheme on 25th March, when they issued a consultation paper. We very much hope that all those with an interest in the scheme will <P>


<a name="column_407"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>find the time to read that document and submit whatever comments they consider appropriate. When we have had the chance to consider all the responses carefully, we shall be better placed to see whether further changes to the scheme would be desirable and, if so, to seek the necessary parliamentary approval.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para13"></a>The draft alterations before the House are being recommended without prejudice to the consultation exercise. We should like to think that we have got these limited changes about right, but we accept that others could take a different view. The important point to bear in mind is that these changes, like the rest of the scheme, are not cast in stone. Appropriate corrections can always be made at a later date, should that be Parliament's wish.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para14"></a>I hope it will be clear from my remarks that these changes are necessary and, I hope the House will agree, non-contentious. Their sole purpose is to enable the authority to settle a number of outstanding claims. I accordingly commend the draft alterations to your Lordships. I beg to move.

<A NAME="90428-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I am not here to declare an interest in respect of an injury sustained on Saturday, as I am unable to pin criminal responsibility on the members of the House of Commons rugby team. I simply missed my tackle.

<A NAME = "90428-14_para16"></a>However, I have an interest to declare as a former member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, from which I resigned when the previous Home Secretary, Mr. Howard, introduced his so-called "reforms" to remove the system that had worked well until that time, whereby compensation was assessed in accordance with common law damages, and introduced the tariff scheme. I am deeply disappointed that, after so long in office, this Government have done no more than tinker slightly on the margins of that scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para17"></a>I note that in February 1994, when the tariff scheme was first introduced, the then Shadow Home Secretary said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Victims of violent crime should be properly compensated for their suffering... These mean-spirited proposals should be withdrawn".
The Shadow Home Secretary who made that comment, Mr. Tony Blair, continued to say that the proposed changes to the compensation scheme were wholly inconsistent with the Government's professed concern for victims of crime.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-14_para18"></a>When the Bill that brought about those alterations was introduced into the House of Commons, the Shadow Home Secretary, who had changed his identity to Mr. Jack Straw, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The proposals fail adequately to recognise the experience which victims have suffered or to assist them to recover from that experience and live as normal a life as possible... The Secretary of State said...that the scales of justice had tilted too far in favour of offenders...His actions belie his words. He has sought to cut victims' compensation by half and to cut the compensation available to some victims--the most severely injured--to a tenth of what they would have received".--[Official Report, Commons, 23/5/95; col. 750.]

<A NAME = "90428-14_para19"></a>Since the tariff scheme was introduced there has been widespread public concern expressed in the newspapers about the level of awards made to people who have suffered grievous injury. For example, the parents of the murdered teenager Louise Smith received just &#163;10,000; an Austrian tourist who was raped received &#163;10,000; and a child aged seven wounded in a machete attack at school was awarded a mere &#163;7,950. She suffered a scar across her face which will last for the rest of her life.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para20"></a>There was huge publicity about this matter last September, as a result of which it was reported that Mr. Straw, now the real Home Secretary, had caved in to public pressure and announced an urgent review of the highly criticised criminal injuries compensation scheme and would do something about it. It was reported that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A Home Office unit will carry out the review in the next few months but the overall budget of &#163;200 million will not be raised".
What do we have seven or eight months after the announcement? With the greatest respect to the Minister who has introduced this measure--I appreciate that perhaps he does not have the same history of the compensation scheme that I have--all it has produced are awards to 240 people. When he said that for the first time, I wondered whether he meant 240,000 people. But it is quite clear that 240 people out of an annual figure of 60,000 to 70,000 will be entitled to awards under the draft scheme now before your Lordships.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-14_para21"></a>The Minister also said that the tariff will remain the same--there has been no alteration--but that there has been some tinkering with the punctuation. What kind of Home Secretary is it who announces in September an urgent review of the highly criticised criminal injuries compensation scheme and comes up with total peanuts some eight months later? I ask the Minister to carry back to the Home Office the message that the tariff scheme, highly criticised as it was at the time, means injustice for the victims of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para22"></a>The more I hear the Home Secretary and Ministers who speak for the Home Office in this House go on about making the victims of crime their first priority, the more cynical I become about politics in this country. Something must be done for the victims of crime to put them in the same position as those injured in other ways, whether in employment or road traffic accidents, whose lives are destroyed, to ensure that justice and parity are meted out in this country.

<A NAME="90428-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Burlison, to the Dispatch Box for the first time. It is pleasant to hear him speak in this capacity, and we look forward to hearing him again. I also welcome the draft scheme, modest as it is. It is undoubtedly an extremely modest scheme, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the Minister adequately demonstrated. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, also drew attention to the fact that, when the tariff scheme was first introduced, the Labour Opposition, as it was then, did not like the idea of an arrangement that fixed relatively moderate amounts of compensation for criminal injuries in this way. In the <P>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>meanwhile they appear to have been converted to the scheme and, with the zeal of the convert, they now make modest improvements to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para23"></a>The advantage of the tariff based scheme is that it allows more certain settlements to be made more quickly. As the Minister said, some 240 settlements have so far been held up because of the lack of precise definition; and this order is primarily devoted to allowing settlement of those claims already in the pipeline as well as future claims which will be covered by the new definitions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para24"></a>These minor improvements are to be welcomed. However, we all recognise, too, that this modest order is likely to be succeeded by further legislation following the consultation which has been referred to. It has been going on for some time. It would be helpful if the Minister were able to tell us a little more about how consideration of the wider reforms is progressing, the most modest of which would be increases in line with inflation, since the figures were first fixed several years ago. But the consultation involves a great deal more than the issue of inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-14_para25"></a>In the wider context, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, pointed out, greater emphasis has been placed in recent years on looking after the victims of crime. We support that emphasis. The previous government did so, and the Government have continued this theme into their Home Office policies. It is a valuable change of emphasis in our system. This modest order is to be welcomed; and we look forward to the future changes.

<A NAME="90428-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burlison: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for his kind comments. I thank, too, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his comments on the scheme. I note what he says. The noble Lord will appreciate that the consultation exercise has to take place before we can respond in the way he suggests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para0"></a>The potential respondents to the consultation have been given three months, until mid-June, to submit their views. As the noble Lord, Lord Cope, indicated, at this moment in time the issue is ongoing. We shall need to consider all representations carefully and to take advice, as necessary, from the authority and the appeals panel as to the practicality and the affordability of any suggestions that appear to have merit. The appeals panel has a statutory duty to advise the Secretary of State when so asked. That will be done on this occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para1"></a>We also need to consider the fact that, by July, Scotland will have devolved powers and we shall need to consult the Scottish Executive about any changes being considered. That will all take time. It is unlikely that we shall be ready to offer proposals to Parliament before the end of 1999.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para2"></a>I hope that those comments are helpful. However, I appreciate that, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said, my history in this area may be somewhat less than his. I thank both noble Lords for their comments. Accordingly, I invite noble Lords to approve the draft alterations.

<A NAME="90428-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will take steps to prevent the imminent extinction of the capercaillie in the United Kingdom by the creation of special protected areas under Article 4 of the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC), and by seeking its re-scheduling as a Schedule 1 Part II species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and by other measures of special protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may correct my failure and congratulate the noble Lord who responded to the previous Motion on his accession to the Front Bench. Perhaps I may say what a pleasure it is to have the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, replying to an Unstarred Question for the first time from the Front Bench.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para5"></a>As your Lordships will know, this is the season when the male capercaillie is most active in its breeding displays on the leks. For many years, Mr. Jimmy Oswald, who is well known to some of your Lordships in the House tonight, has kept a count in Glen Tanar, one of the few remaining habitats on Deeside, which is already designated a special protection area. He tells me that last year he counted 170 birds, but this year, despite trampling the whole of the estate for a period in excess of a fortnight, he has counted only 14.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para6"></a>That indicates an accelerating trend which is perhaps worse than the most pessimistic forecasts. It was believed that there were approximately 2,200 birds left in Scotland a year or two ago, compared with the 20,000-odd in the 1960s and 1970s. But even those estimates predicted a drop in the number of females from 1,467 in 1994 to 206 in 2003. Therefore, those pessimistic forecasts from the past are today, some four years in advance, being met in a count on the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para7"></a>I am sure that your Lordships will agree that the capercaillie is a magnificent bird. I was amused to be advised today by my noble friend Lord Avebury that the word comes from the ancient Gaelic, capull coille, and that customarily in the 15th and 16th centuries it was spelt with a Z. I was not aware of that. It is an expression which means "the horse of the wood". It is a bird which was described in champagne terms by Mr. Duff Hart-Davies as the "jeroboam" of British birds. That appeared in the Independent a week ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para8"></a>As your Lordships will know, a cock bird can weigh up to eight or nine pounds and stand more than two feet tall, with the most magnificent colours: slate grey, a black beard of feathers on the throat, a brilliant red patch of skin above the eye and a glossy blue/green mottled white breast. It has feathered legs and in display it puffs out a black fantail, mottled with white. The female is more elegantly subdued with buff, black and greyish-white plumage and a reddish breast. Its diet is blaeberries, pine needles and conifer shoots. Although it is of turkey size, I am told that it is not much to eat. Indeed, a ghillie on the Glen Tanar estate told me that as a boy his mother would stuff a capercaillie, when one had been shot, with potatoes in order to take away the pine flavour. She would make sure to throw the potatoes <P>


<a name="column_411"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>away, but even so he was not a fan of what he ate because the taste was something resembling an air freshener!
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para9"></a>I understand that the capercaillie is fierce when roused. My noble friend Lady Linklater tells me that there was a caper living near the woods near her home when she was young and newly married. It was familiarly called "Stanley", which is a very appropriate name. It would puff up its throat feathers, fan out its tail and chase her away. That brings a rather pleasant picture into the mind. On one occasion, it knocked down her nine year-old son!
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para10"></a>As your Lordships are aware, its habitat is wide in Scotland, through Aberdeenshire, Kincardine, Moray, Inverness and West Perthshire. So far, five special protection areas have been designated at Abernethy, the Cairngorms, Glen Tanar, Ballochbuie and Loch Lomond. There is another proposed and in the pipeline.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para11"></a>What are the causes of the decline which have so disastrously hit this glorious bird? The Institute for Terrestrial Ecology at Banchory and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds at Edinburgh agree that the cause of the decline is poor breeding. There are a number of reasons for that. The first is the reduction in and disturbance of habitat. It is curious that eager birdwatchers at lekking displays, or walkers stumbling upon lekking displays, can cause as much disruption to the cycle as anything else. It is fortunate that previous reductions of habitat have been checked and restored, but I have been told by Mr. Nigel Buxton of Scottish Natural Heritage that despite the restoration of habitat, the rapid decline has not ceased.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para12"></a>But perhaps the worst cause of the deaths of capercaillie is deer fence collisions. Mr. Bob Moss of the Institute for Terrestrial Ecology is of the view that flying into fences is the main single cause of deaths among young and full-grown capercaillie, particularly in spring, when females home in on the males on the leks and are caught in the unseen fence. Mr. Moss considers that if fence deaths had been halved, the decline would not have occurred, despite the poor breeding which is the fundamental cause of the birds' imminent extinction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para13"></a>A study documented by the RSPB at Abernethy and Glen Tanar found no fewer than four dead capercaillie per kilometre of fence per month; the highest death rate being between September and November, when the capercaillie disperse. Thirty two per cent of capers that had been radio-tagged were found to have been killed by fence collisions. In 93 per cent of the cases documented in the studies, caper collisions with deer fences were fatal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para14"></a>Deer fences are important in considering the decline of the capercaillie, but there is also over-grazing by deer and sheep, and the suppressing of growth of the blaeberry plants needed by the birds for food and shelter. In addition, pollution and climate change have undoubtedly had an effect on insect life in Scotland, as those of us who know the area are only too well aware. Moreover, chicks which hatch in the late spring, when there is insufficient food to support them, will not survive.
<P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para15"></a>Fox snares are a further cause of decline when set in capercaillie leks, although perfectly legally set by keepers. It is said that one Deeside keeper has inadvertently snared five cocks in leks in the past two years. Therefore, it is important that the snaring of foxes be carefully controlled and carefully carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para16"></a>I have outlined the problem, but what can be done about it? Some of your Lordships may feel that conservation is harmful to the preservation of the deer, but that is not the view that I take. It is true that the loss of areas of native Caledonian pine has been reversed, due to the enlightened activities of Forest Enterprise and environmental charities. Private landowners have been actively and enthusiastically engaged. Tribute must be paid to the landowners for the concern and care they have taken over the years to maintain the capercaillie birds.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para17"></a>It is essential that redundant deer fences be removed. There are many ways of controlling deer, but building deer fences and maintaining them after the trees they are supposed to protect have grown to a sufficient height is a way of ensuring that the capercaillie birds are wiped out. A policy of forest restoration in the Abernethy Forest, for example--a forest owned by the RSPB--involving removal of all the fences, has seen a net increase in the population. That is a positive indication of the way in which things can change.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para18"></a>There is an obligation under Article 8 of the birds directive, which prohibits,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all means, arrangements or methods ... capable of causing the local disappearance of a species".
Under that directive, redundant deer fences, or existing deer fences, could be made less fatal to the capercaillie by their replacement with plastic, wooden or electric fences, or by their clear marking so that the birds can see them easily as they fly in. Your Lordships should note that woodland improvement grants are available from the Forestry Authority for woodland biodiversity enhancement.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-15_para19"></a>The deer management groups, which play an important role in Scotland and with which landowners are involved, are those to whom people concerned about the capercaillie should turn for discussion and for the working out of appropriate plans to preserve the bird. Throughout Scotland, landowners have imposed a voluntary ban on shooting. My Unstarred Question neither proposes nor implies that the capercaillie should cease to be a game bird. That is because the co-operation of landowners is vital to its success.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para20"></a>Annex IV of the birds directive also means that the killing of capercaillie by snares set for foxes is prohibited. So those who set those snares must take appropriate care.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para21"></a>But the RSPB and others believe that the number of special protected areas should be at least doubled. There are capercaillie on some 20 to 30 estates. The ITE study in 1994 covered 14 of those estates, so there are many more than the five existing SPAs and the one which is proposed. Scottish National Heritage is charged with identifying suitable territories. It makes the scientific case; it carries out the consultations; and the Minister instructs the SNH to classify the site so that the details <P>


<a name="column_413"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can be forwarded to Europe. It is crucially important that further special protected areas are designated in those areas where the capercaillie still exists in numbers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para22"></a>My Question asks also for the transfer of the capercaillie to Schedule 1, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. That would result in the bird becoming specially protected during the vulnerable lekking and breeding season so that criminal offences would be committed by those who sought to take eggs or birds, whether live or dead.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para23"></a>Finally, I ask the Government to give the fullest support to the capercaillie core group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Steve Sankey of the RSPB, which is doing its utmost to publicise the problems and to work out practical solutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para24"></a>Today is almost too late. The capercaillie is nearly gone. It may be said that, effectively, it has gone. We do not ask for further committee meetings, assemblies or discussions to take place at some future time. We are asking for action which will protect a species which decorates and enhances the Caledonian forest, itself a living remnant from the long-gone Ice Age. The capercaillie depends upon an environment which is healthy and free at least from man-made hazards. It is in itself a reminder of the strength of the past and, at the same time, of the fragility of the Scottish landscape. We cannot afford to lose a single part of the intricate machine which makes up the diverse and beautiful country that is Scotland.

<P>
<A NAME="90428-15_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, as a Scot, I must extend special thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, not only for raising this matter but also for, as a Welshman, giving us such a definitive and authoritative account of the circumstances surrounding the capercaillie in Scotland at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para25"></a>I should also declare an interest as chairman of the RSPB in Scotland. Indeed, it is the RSPB which has been tasked by government, along with the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, to lead and co-ordinate the conservation actions required, it is hoped, to save the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para26"></a>Those conservation actions are set out in a specific biodiversity action plan. The steering group for the species action plan has also been set up. It includes, from the public sector, the Forestry Commission, Forest Enterprise, SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage). In addition there is the Game Conservancy Trust, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and the Scottish Landowners' Federation. It is also joined by an eminent capercaillie scientist in the person of Dr. Robert Moss. All these agencies and organisations must act together in a co-ordinated way if there is to be any hope of a comeback for the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para27"></a>The RSPB accords the highest possible conservation status to the capercaillie, which, as the noble Lord well described, is now on the brink of its second extinction in Scotland. The present population was originally released in Perthshire from Sweden in the 1830s. As the statistics given to the House by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, indicate, that population has <P>


<a name="column_414"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>crashed from an estimated 20,000 in the 1970s to what is predicted to be a mere 1,000 birds today. In addition, its range is calculated to have dropped by some 63 per cent between 1968 and 1991. The population modelling carried out by the RSPB scientists and others further predicts that only 200 capercaillies will remain in the year 2002 if the present rate of decline continues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para28"></a>It is quite clear that this species is in the gravest danger. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, described, its decline is principally due to poor breeding productivity but that, in turn, is caused by a whole series of inter-related factors. Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation have been compounded by a deterioration in the quality of that habitat which still remains. The breeding productivity of the capercaillie needs to be around 0.9 chicks per hen in order to sustain the capercaillie population in Scotland. Yet in recent years that productivity rate has plummeted to 0.2 chicks per hen or even less. Clearly, this is not sustainable and there is little hope that the population will not become extinct unless that productivity can be improved. As we have heard, the poor spring weather in the past couple of years has only added to the difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para29"></a>One of the principal problems, well described by the noble Lord, is the serious problem posed for capercaillies by deer fences within those forests still inhabited by the capercaillie. Scientists estimate that one-third of all adult capercaillies are killed each year by flying into those fences. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, gave us some stark and startling facts. It is quite obvious that urgent action is needed to rectify that situation, especially in those areas of Scotland which can still be regarded as being core sites for the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para30"></a>In addition, the capercaillie chicks depend heavily on blaeberry. They do so for two reasons: first, because blaeberry provides a high-energy protein for growth in the form of caterpillars. Secondly, and of importance, is the fact that blaeberry provides very useful cover for the capercaillie to hide from predators, which can be a threat. In most forests still inhabited by capercaillie, deer grazing has reduced the quality and quantity of this vital understorey. It is therefore essential that the Deer Commission for Scotland, helped by SNH, identifies the important remaining forests with capercaillie and ensures that effective deer management to allow the vegetation to recover is carried out across those sites. If I remember correctly, I believe it has a duty to do so under Section 1(2) of the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996--legislation which this House will remember well. It should work closely with landowners and deer management groups to ensure that this better management occurs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para31"></a>As described by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, some of the problems for the capercaillie are not without irony. In recent years, as they have become rarer, they have become more vulnerable to disturbance by birdwatchers and others. This has proved a serious problem in areas such as Strathspey. This disturbance must be avoided at all costs in view of the perilous situation of the population. Adding them, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, suggests, to Schedule 1, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1991 is a <P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposal that the RSPB would endorse. This would give them the added protection through the threat of special penalties under law if they are disturbed during the close season, their breeding season.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para32"></a>What else can be done? Additional funding should, I believe, be provided to landowners and forest managers in order to remove fences, to manage deer better and to create other habitat features used by the capercaillie, such as pools and wet areas within forests. These areas are important for the proper management of invertebrate populations and therefore for the food that the capercaillie chicks need. All remaining capercaillie sites should be eligible for such funding. An increase in funds to improve biodiversity for the public good could be facilitated by Article 32 of the new Agenda 2000 Rural Development Regulation. It could be administered by the Forestry Commission. It is important that the new forestry strategy for Scotland should contain such actions to save one of our most magnificent forest species from extinction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para33"></a>Rural support funds such as these, and others such as the woodland grant schemes, should be targeted towards biodiversity priorities in this way. Forest managers with capercaillie in special protection areas, special areas of conservation and SSSIs should be given the greatest possible assistance in managing the national assets for the public good.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para34"></a>The question put to the Government by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asks whether they will take steps to prevent the imminent extinction of the capercaillie in the United Kingdom. Anticipating the Minister's answer perhaps, I expect him to say that he will take steps and indeed is taking them to do just that. Indeed, from the public sector agencies involved in the Species Action Fund and the steering group, undoubtedly assistance is coming forward from Government. However, the question that therefore arises, which I would like to put to the Minister tonight, is this: will he make a commitment that the Government will take further steps if the sum of the current effort proves to be insufficient? I very much hope that the answer will be yes. I have a sneaking feeling that the answer may be that this is a question which is up to the Scottish Parliament to answer. To an extent, regarding the allocation of front-line effort and front-line resources, he may well be right. However, if he kicks the question into touch like that I believe he is wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-15_para35"></a>Ultimately we have an international obligation under European law to do everything we can to ensure the survival of the capercaillie. If we fail in that obligation it is not the Scottish executive who will stand accused of breaching European obligations; it will be the United Kingdom Government who will have to face that charge. It is the DETR and the United Kingdom Government in London who will have the infraction proceedings lodged against them. It is in London where the fines will be imposed if we are deemed to be in continuing breach of a European obligation. So, in answering the Question tonight as to whether or not the Minister can give a commitment that the Government will take further steps if the sum of the current effort <P>


<a name="column_416"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proves to be insufficient, I hope he will bear in mind that simply saying that this is up to the Scottish Parliament is not good enough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90428-16_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I express a sentiment which has been expressed many times in this House rather better than I will express it tonight; that is, if the proposed right-to-roam legislation is not accompanied by responsibilities to be exercised by those utilising that right to roam, and if the resourcing by government in terms of the management that would be required for a more general right to roam is not forthcoming, then it will further add to the problems from which the capercaillie are already suffering.

<A NAME="90428-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kimball: </B>   My Lords, a lot of things happened in 1745 in Scotland, but among others, that was the date when the last recorded capercaillie was seen in Strath Spey. It was last recorded in Sutherland in 1769. The Reverend Mr. Morris, writing in his British Birds in 1857, commented on the reintroduction--mentioned by my noble friend Lord Lindsay--of the 54 adult birds that were brought into this country in 1838. He wrote that the native branch of the family was extinct, but the reintroduction of the collateral branch which holds sway in other lands allowed the bird to be renaturalised here.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para0"></a>So we have had a major problem with the capercaillie in the past, to the extent that it was actually extinct. I believe that the breeding success of the capercaillie and its close relative the black grouse, are directly related to predation by the worst mammalian predator which is now exploding all over Scotland; I mean the pine marten. All ground-nesting birds are at risk from foxes, but we can control them and feral cats--we have a particular problem with the protected wild cat. But the success of the 1838 reintroduction was at a time when the pine marten was virtually exterminated and driven back to its last remaining haunts on the west coast of Scotland in the deer forest, from which it has unfortunately recolonised much of Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para1"></a>The caper that were introduced in 1838 spread in a large way by interbreeding with the thriving population of black grouse. We all know that the black grouse and the capercaillie will cross, and there is very little difference between the caper hen and the greyhen. It was significant that Mr. St. John, in his Tour of the Highlands, mentions the extermination of the pine marten in 1870. If we were to follow that up by looking in Mr. Thorburn's book on British mammals, he actually gives the caper and the black grouse as the main species to suffer from the pine marten. He goes on to comment in his chapter on the pine marten,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90428-16_para2"></a>So the incrimination of the pine marten is well recorded and well known. It is no good increasing protection for the caper without using the powers that <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Government have to allow the eradication once again of the pine marten in the areas where we want the caper to do well. The growth of the pine marten is exploding all over Scotland. I have seen one in the daytime and run over one in the evening. They are quite easily controlled. They are a very bold member of the weasel family and the largest, and only they and the polecat in that family are protected.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para3"></a>Another point your Lordships should consider is that we must take more note of the work that is being done on black grouse research, which is now being carried on in Langden Beck. It is interesting that shooting of grey and caper hens in certain circumstances is a necessary tool of management. I do not know if it has been proven, but the old caper hen has the same problem as the old greyhen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para4"></a>I remember a famous old head keeper telling me, over a period of 40 years, that we must shoot the old greyhens to have a thriving black grouse population, which we certainly had for 40 years. The old greyhen, and I suspect the caper hen, becomes infertile and pushes the fertile hen off the nest. Then that particular old lady does not have the patience or inclination to hatch the eggs. The old grey hen is certainly vermin and I suspect that a finger of suspicion must point at the old caper hen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para5"></a>I shall not add to what has already been said about the problem of the deer fences. We have this craze all over Scotland at present for putting up these awful chain-link fences everywhere in order to achieve natural regeneration. But, with that regeneration, one gets not only the natural regeneration of the pine but also an area of rank, long heather that makes it quite impossible to control the predators.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para6"></a>There will not be time tonight to deal with the whole problem of avian predation, but we will be making a great mistake if we do not realise that a rather weakly caper chick is a very easy prey for the exploding population of hen harriers. There are many other reasons involved, but I believe that we shall be making a grave mistake tonight if, among the reasons for the decline and the poor breeding of the capercaillie, we neglect the whole problem of both mammalian and avian predation.

<A NAME="90428-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, it has been a pleasure to listen to the three previous speeches because all of them have been very constructive about how we might try to help encourage the number of capers that we have in the future. I need not rehearse the figures because the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, gave them most clearly, as indeed did my noble friend Lord Lindsay. I was glad that there has been no pressure from previous speakers to say that a ban must be placed on shooting. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, rightly said, the estate owners who are fortunate enough to have capers are very restrictive and carefully ensure that the voluntary ban is in place so that the capers are given every chance to reproduce.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para7"></a>I know from signing the Birds Directive myself in 1979 in Berne, Switzerland--and, subsequently, when I took the Wildlife and Countryside Act through the <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House of Commons--how important it was that the capers should be included in the schedule. Of course, Part I of Schedule 2 allows them to be shot outside the close season. I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and others, are right in pressing for them to be rescheduled into Part II of Schedule 1. I am not really certain that that would give all that much more protection than is given to them at present, especially during the important period of nesting.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para8"></a>Rescheduling is an issue about which I have always been worried. I say that because often when a bird or a mammal is transferred from one schedule to another--and that does not happen very frequently--it remains there. Indeed, there is far too much inflexibility about these schedules. I remember Sir Arthur Duncan, when he was chairman of the Nature Conservancy, before it became the Nature Conservancy Council, saying, at the time when the Brent goose was taken off the quarry list and put on the protected list, that that would be done on the assurance that the Brent goose would go back on the quarry list when the numbers increased.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para9"></a>As we all know, the south and south-east of England is awash with Brent geese, but there is no success at all in restoring them to the quarry list. That would be a much more effective way of controlling their numbers than simply putting them on the protected list. There is the same problem in Islay with the barnacle and, to a lesser extent, the white-fronted goose; namely, that we do not have sufficient flexibility. If we carried on in Islay with the responsible culling of barnacle and shot about 600 to 800 a year as was done before they were on the protected list, we would not have the immediate problems there, where the numbers far exceed the amount of food available on the island. We must consider a more flexible approach in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para10"></a>My noble friends on this side of the House have rightly highlighted habitat as one of the reasons why reproduction is so disappointing at present. I accept that over-grazing and the loss of the blaeberries is one of the reasons for that. For that reason, we should give some credit to the Red Deer Commission, now the Deer Commission. Under the chairmanship of Patrick Gordon Duff Pennington, that body caused the deer management groups to spring into action and to cull hinds in the winter. I believe we have not allowed sufficient time for the work of the past three or four years to achieve results in terms of improved habitat in the pine forests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para11"></a>We need to keep encouraging these groups. We should give every assistance to the Deer Commission to carry out a high cull each year. I have been to Abernethy, which is of course run by the RSPB, and Creag Meagaidh, which is run by SNH, where the deer fences have to a large extent been removed. The deer are severely culled in those places. That has resulted in a significant improvement in capercaillie numbers. We should thank the RSPB for setting a fine example in this regard, particularly at Abernethy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para12"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lindsay said, we should encourage the Forestry Commission to become more involved in the woodland grants scheme and to remove deer fences, both those that are falling down and those which may be erected in the near future. There is no <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>doubt that that is one of the leading causes of falling numbers of capercaillie. I believe that grants are available to do that under the challenge funds offered by the Cairngorm Partnership. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, will mention that when he replies to the debate. I should like to see greater help being made available in Perthshire and Easter Ross, as the majority of the money is now given to projects in Speyside and Deeside. I have visited the Institute for Terrestrial Ecology at Banchory and I know what an important part it is playing in trying to increase capercaillie reproduction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Kimball raised the important matter of predators. Predators pose as great a threat to the survival of capercaillies as do loss of habitat and the threats posed by deer fences. I believe we have afforded far too much protection to the pine marten. That predator has caused serious problems in the Highlands. I was dead against it receiving protection at all, as it is a species that offers few advantages and many disadvantages. It brings death and destruction to nesting birds in Scotland. As my noble friend Lord Kimball said, we can control foxes through efficient keepering. We really must consider the issue of raptors, although I know that is anathema to the RSPB. However, they pose a major nuisance in Scotland and there is an enormous number of them. They cause great harm.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para14"></a>It would be wrong of me not to mention the Langholm experiment, particularly bearing in mind the title I hold. We have been talking about the dramatic loss of capers and their imminent extinction and how right the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is to raise this subject. Once upon a time Langholm Moor was the finest grouse moor in Scotland with thousands upon thousands of grouse. It now has just a few hundred grouse. That represents as serious a drop in grouse numbers as in numbers of capercaillie in the areas we are discussing. The Game Conservancy, SNH and ITE produced a scientific report to suggest ways of restoring Langholm Moor. We have scientific proof of the drop in grouse numbers particularly as a result of hen harrier predation. Yet no one will take action in this regard. Everyone was agreed that if scientific evidence was produced of this drop in grouse numbers action should be taken to rectify the matter. We have the scientific proof but no one seems prepared to take action. The lead department, SNH, must say why it is doing nothing in this regard. It cannot just pretend there is a problem with the habitat. It is not just a matter of a problem with the habitat. Anyone who knows that part of the world--as I do--knows that hen harrier predation has had a disastrous effect on grouse numbers. Grouse and heather go together. If we were to have neither, think of the loss to the scenery and scenic beauty of Scotland, irrespective of the loss of the livelihoods of keepers who have been discharged from the Langholm Moors because there are no grouse to shoot there.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para15"></a>I agree with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Lindsay about the right to roam. From what we hear about the probabilities of the Scottish Parliament, the right to roam may prove to be a very much more serious issue in Scotland than it is likely to be in England and <P>


<a name="column_420"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. What more could one want to do than walk through lovely pine forests--I am thinking particularly of the ones in Deeside--but if large numbers of people are doing it at the time of the year when birds are nesting it will be a major setback for the caper. It is absolutely right that there should be exclusivity over breeding areas, perhaps through special protection areas. The more special protection areas there are, the more the caper will have peace and quiet during the nesting period. Anyone who brings in right to roam legislation in Scotland without giving this matter due consideration will be making certain that one of the most beautiful and wonderful birds in Scotland will disappear forever.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para16"></a>There has been a positive note in the debate that we must do something and not just sit back and wait for the capers to go. I shall be most disappointed if the ministerial response does not indicate that action will be taken this year. Current Ministers must have some influence over the future parliament in Scotland; there must be some relationship in carrying through urgent legislation. In the light of the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, which show that the situation could not be more serious, this matter must be given high priority. Something must happen this year.

<A NAME="90428-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Burton: </B>   My Lords, I have lived near capercaillie for most of my life and no one could have a keener desire to see their numbers built up once again. Alas, I fear that the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will have the reverse effect of what he and I and everyone who has spoken tonight desire.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para17"></a>We have been told that caper died out in the 18th century and were reintroduced in 1837. Why did they die out? I do not know if it is now possible for our boffins to discover that. It may have been something to do with the environment or conditions of which there are historical records. That may provide the answer to the present situation. Once caper were reintroduced, they fairly rapidly spread until in many places there were surplus stocks which could be readily culled. What must be looked at, and can be looked at now, is the difference between 1837 and 1999. My noble friend Lord Munro gave a few answers. I agree with every word he said. I hope that those words will be listened to very carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para18"></a>Caper were not liked by some of our foresters who felt that they damaged the Scots fir trees. The problem was over-exaggerated. One heard of woodsmen putting their feet on nests, which was quite unnecessary because caper preferred to sit on top of the old "granny" trees. Alas, there are very few of the granny trees left now--a lot have been cut down--and that is a part of the environment which has disappeared. Caper could sit on the top of these big trees and peck all around them without the risk of the top collapsing or breaking off because there was no main top to break. Caper did not like the commercial forests because they could not sit on the tops of fir trees, which have big, long shoots that would just break off. But they could damage the commercial forests until such time as the trees grew to above the head height of a cock caper sitting on the <P>


<a name="column_421"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ground, which is perhaps three, four or five years of growth. One of my plantings was quite badly damaged by capercaillie where they had pecked off the leaders from the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para19"></a>Capercaillie are particularly partial to blaeberries and that type of vegetation which grows on our hills, though protein such as insects is also vital for the young birds. The giant ant-heaps which used to be found in our mature Scots fir plantations were important to the diet of the young birds. They were a wonderful sporting bird and could fly faster than any of the other types of grouse. In those days, they were plentiful where the habitat was favourable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para20"></a>There were plenty of deer fanciers in those days. At the end of the rides we used to tie a bunch of heather on the fences so that the capercaillie could see them. Nowadays, we have all this plastic material and so we could quite easily make fences visible to the birds. They fly into fences when frightened. If people are walking about all over the place scaring them, they will try to look back to see what is there or where a noise comes from. That is when they fly into the fences. In Abernethy, a considerable amount of disturbance is caused not only by people who perhaps should not be there but also by what I again call boffins who wander around looking at the caper.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para21"></a>As a small boy--a long time ago--I remember being placed with .410 gun round the corner of a wood at the end of a line of guns and in one drive managing to get five cock caper which were trying to creep away from the main line of guns. Sadly, however, disaster struck in about 1960 and almost all our stock of these fine birds died out in one winter. At about that time, other bird numbers also crashed, particularly birds of the moorland--plover, curlew, snipe, grouse, and many others. I believe that the crash in salmon and trout numbers also originated in the early 1960s. It would perhaps be easy to attribute the decline in caper to some disease, as they are very prone to ailments like "blackhead", but the loss of other species and fish leads one to believe that the cause was probably something else, possibly acid rain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para22"></a>In spite of shooting, caper numbers rose steadily following their reintroduction and after the crash land owners ceased shooting them altogether. I know of no Scottish estate now which does not give strict protection to these birds. While I was deer stalking a few years ago, six giant cocks flew across a clearing, one behind the other. The stalker said to me, "Whatever you do, don't tell anyone what you have seen. They must be protected and left in peace. They must not be unnecessarily disturbed." I have held my peace for some years but I think the time has come when I should tell the House the story. It shows how estate keepers were trying to protect those birds and other birds too.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para23"></a>We now have great difficulty with people wanting to see the birds. It would make life a great deal easier if those people asked where on the estates they could go. I gather that the Aviemore area in particular is indulging in what is known as eco-tourism. People are paying to go out to see these birds when they are mating--as one noble Lord said, when they are on the lek--and also <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when they are nesting. It is intolerable to have a line of people walking though your wood trying to put the caper off their nests. That is happening. I need scarcely say that that is most damaging to what is now becoming a very rare bird. Indeed, our last breeding hen, having been put off her nest three years running by people walking their dogs, eventually disappeared. I say the last one, but I believe that for the past three or four years we have had one pair. I hesitate to tell anyone because they may be disturbed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para24"></a>Modern forestry no longer allows Scots fir trees to grow or remain in mature condition. The economics are such that, as soon as they reach that stage, which is what the caper are looking for, they are cut down. The reduction in mature pine and the vast increase in predators, about which we heard so much from my two noble friends, apart from the disturbance, did not take place during the heyday of the capercaillie. In this day and age, much of the caper's territory, but not all, is polluted with pine martens. I believe that they have been reintroduced in the south-west by the Forestry Commission. I am not sure about Aberdeenshire; I do not think it is too bad as yet, but I gather that pine martens are spreading there. It is difficult to understand how the caper, as ground nesting birds, are expected to survive these predators, which are more destructive than any mink. An estate of my acquaintance lost two of its last capercaillie hens, while they were nesting, to goshawks released by environmentalists. But also, any caper chicks that survive make delicious meals for buzzards, which easily catch the young chicks on the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para25"></a>One of the requirements for the caper chicks is low ground cover, particularly the likes of blaeberry. If the ground cover under Scots fir trees is not kept short, the heather will grow rank and high, which is totally unsuitable for what are fragile birds up to the age of about 10 or 12 weeks. Furthermore, when the heather is in that condition, there is nothing for them to eat. At one time, the deer, particularly roe deer, which are more territorial than red deer, grazed this woodland cover. But now foresters and environmentalists have branded deer "unfriendly". My noble friend Lord Lindsay again castigated deer on behalf of the RSPB. But I wish to draw attention to the fact that they have a useful purpose. My noble friend talked about deer doing damage. But, after all, many of the woods where the caper existed were fenced off. There were no deer in them. Now the undergrowth has grown and they have lost their habitat. One landowner I know is seriously considering burning the heather under the old Scots pine, but he is obviously frightened of the fire damaging his old trees. I shared his concern, but since speaking with him I have received a report from Stora Forest, a firm in Sweden. It points out that, in Sweden, there are a number of natural forest fires every year; and, as nature uses fire, the firm has experimented and now burns the undergrowth over considerable areas itself. It states that the bigger trees do not suffer. The matter should be looked at. It is a possibility, although it would need careful controlling.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para26"></a>Is it considered for one moment that, if we increase the directives for protection, anyone would be allowed to burn any area where a caper might be nesting? It would obviate the whole approach. It is important that we try to look after this bird without endless interference from officialdom. That is vital for the survival of the young birds. The proposed directive refers to the repercussion of man's activities and also to the destruction and pollution of habitats. So burning is exactly what people should not be allowed to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para27"></a>Nothing is done about stopping the repercussions of man's activities. They are steadily increasing. More and more people are wandering about in the woods, being encouraged to look at birds, and disturbing them when they are nesting. Ospreys have been driven off their nests by people who come to look at them. It is much better that those who not only know about the birds but are very desirous of increasing their numbers should be allowed to continue to look after them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para28"></a>It was not shooting that caused the crash in their numbers. Once the crash came the enormous increase in predators did not permit their numbers to recover. If this protection order was introduced, would eco-tourists and dog-walkers be banned from any area in which the birds might be nesting? If not, what is the point of the order? What kind of protection other than that which they receive at the moment will be secured by the order?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para29"></a>Possibly one of the most highly protected birds today is the kite, known by the British Army throughout the world as a shite-hawk. Two years ago one pair tried to breed on the ground of my trustee on the Black Isle near an osprey's nest. The ospreys objected to the kites and saw them off. The following year two pairs tried. Again, the ospreys drove off one pair but the other a little further away nested successfully and in due course the RSPB ringed, radioed and decorated the two chicks. Next morning one of the chicks was lying dead below the tree. Further inspection found another chick dead in the nest. Another highly protected creature--the pine marten--had visited the nest. Which is the more highly protected of these species--the pine marten or the kite? There is too much activity in protecting and watching these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para30"></a>Currently, most landowners with capercaillie on their ground are anxious to protect them to their utmost. To initiate this order would remove all this incentive from the landowner and transfer protection to absentee bureaucrats, many of whom know little or nothing of these birds. The RSPB agrees that this protection order is not the best method of protecting this magnificent bird.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para31"></a>One further concern is how the protection areas will be chosen. Often placing a protection order on a piece of land draws attention to it so that public interest increases and destroys exactly what one seeks to protect. I am aware of a classic example. The SNH designated an area to protect great northern divers. Since the designation and increased public disturbance, these birds have not nested there. I understand that five specially protected areas have been set up but they appear to have suffered the greatest losses. I strongly disapprove of any change in the law concerning the capercaillie.

<A NAME="90428-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, having listened to this debate with much pleasure I feel that I should contribute my own experience of capercaillie, which confirms much of what has been said already. It began some 30 years ago and is confined to the Black Wood of Rannoch on the south shore of Loch Rannoch in Perthshire. In 1969 I became the shooting tenant there of the Forestry Commission, which at the time regarded the bird as something of a pest. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Burton has mentioned, its employees at the time were instructed to tread on any caper nests that they came across because the birds were eating the leading shoots of the Scots pine which had recently been planted over a large area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para32"></a>The Black Wood itself is one of the most famous remnants of the ancient Caledonian forest and extends to about 2,000 acres, plus outlying trees. In the late 1960s and early 1970s we reckoned that there were up to about 350 caper in an area of 3,000 acres--an almost incredible density by today's standards. It was possible to count over 60 caper on a single lek. Apart from the predations of the forestry employees, the wood was driven once a year at the end of October, when about 20 cocks were shot in the day. This practice had been going on for many years, at least since the 1920s, and the population and annual bag remained pretty constant until the mid-1970s, when it started to decline rapidly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para33"></a>In the late 1970s we stopped shooting it altogether, estimating that the population had fallen to below 100 birds. As far as I know caper, has not been shot at all in the Black Wood since 1980 but the population has continued to dwindle and today there are few indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para34"></a>So what has happened? What is the cause of this sad decline? From what I have said, it does not appear that shooting can be blamed. The capers' decline in the Black Wood has become much more severe since they were no longer shot. Personally I do not think, as other noble Lords have suggested, that deer fences can be blamed either because our heavy population existed at least 10 years after the fences were built. The odd caper may have flown into them but we did not find many. And, of course, one has to be careful, too, of the anti-deer lobby which is perhaps a little too negative about deer fences, preferring to see massive reductions in the deer population generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para35"></a>What else has happened? The blaeberry heather, other natural regeneration and insects such as ants, have all benefited from the deer fences because the ground has been less heavily grazed. One would have thought that that was a good thing for caper, but perhaps it is not because the population was much greater when the ground was more heavily grazed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para36"></a>There is one other change which other noble Lords have mentioned. Before I come to it, I should perhaps say that I am firmly in the camp of those who believe that habitat is far more important for game birds than is the control of predators. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the pine marten and the polecat have returned to the Black Wood, which were not present in the late 1960s. We suspect that the fox population has also increased as voles and other rodents appear to be more numerous in the denser ground vegetation.

<A NAME = "90428-16_para37"></a>The return of martens and polecats is a good thing in itself, of course, although, like my noble friend Lord Kimball and others, I fear that it could be an important cause of the caper's decline. At least I submit it is something which should be looked into by those more qualified than me.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para38"></a>Another change which other noble Lords have mentioned is that humans use the wood more than they did 30 years ago. Again, this is a good thing and rightly part of Forest Authority policy. But I always found the caper, unlike the grouse, to be a very shy bird, and it may be that it does not like being disturbed too much, especially during the lek and while nesting. I have been fortified in this fear by several conversations I have had with ski guides in the European Alps who were foresters or gamekeepers during the summer and autumn months. They have said that when a ski lift is erected in a new area the caper tend to leave. So I join with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and others and submit that human intrusion may be a factor we should take seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para39"></a>It is hard to think what else can be responsible for this tragic decline of the caper. Perhaps the quality of their winter food--pine needles on the ancient and older trees--has grown impoverished with the trees' advancing age. But in many parts of Scotland maturing Scots pine are now available for them again, so this solution is not clear either. Perhaps the maturing trees are not quite mature enough for the caper. However, that may be, it is an area which justifies more scientific examination.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para40"></a>It will be clear from what I have said that I fear protecting the caper in the way suggested may not alone halt its decline. There must be other factors we must look for, and I have tried to suggest a few. Nevertheless, we must do all that we can, and so I for one support the protection suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, at least as a temporary measure, while we continue the search for the wider and deeper causes which may underlie this tragic decline of one of our most beautiful and mysterious birds.

<A NAME="90428-16_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, I join my noble friends in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, on introducing this interesting and important debate. We have heard speeches on many different aspects, and I shall try not to repeat matters referred to by other noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para41"></a>The capercaillie, extinct in the last century, was reintroduced successfully by our Victorian forebears. We are now faced with the same problem; reduction in habitat and numbers. So much so that recent figures show that perhaps only 1,000 birds are left in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para42"></a>What can be done to halt the decline in numbers and to encourage this magnificent bird to make a comeback? As other noble Lords have said, the problem has many causes; for instance, overgrazing damages their habitat, and predators such as foxes and crows have been instrumental in killing chicks. However, a number of birds have actually managed to breed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para43"></a>Are the Government prepared to consider removing the protection currently enjoyed by the pine marten? If it is a case of the pine marten or the capercaillie, which <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will the Government save? Perhaps we should consider a reintroduction, particularly in areas where conditions are favourable to the bird.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para44"></a>However, deer fences have also had a great impact on the population in various areas. They have accounted for fatalities in many areas and their removal will lower the number of mortalities. The dilemma we face is that to encourage the natural habitat of the capercaillie, deer fences are required. Therefore, a balance must be achieved. These great birds suffer their highest mortality where the fences are only 4.4 metres from the nearest trees. If that distance were increased where deer fences were imperative, would that reduce the mortality rate among the birds? Are there similar problems in other countries? How have the respective wildlife organisations been able to halt the decline in the population?
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para45"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, suggested that the capercaillie should be moved to Schedule 1, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. That appears to give the birds greater protection throughout the season, in particular the closed season. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to that proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para46"></a>The present voluntary ban on shooting is enforced well by landowners. Much encouragement must be given to those who manage habitats to sustain this great bird.

<A NAME="90428-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  My Lords, the Unstarred Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has provoked an interesting and informed debate. That is not surprising when one surveys the wealth of countryside experience, some of it ministerial, on the Benches opposite. He raised a number of issues which I shall address later, as did other noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para47"></a>First, I should like briefly to deal with the Government's position in relation to the conservation of the capercaillie. I make no apologies for underlining many of the fundamental facts already registered so forcefully by your Lordships tonight. As noble Lords would expect, the Government share the noble Lord's concern to ensure that proper measures are put in place for the conservation of the capercaillie. This magnificent bird is one of the rarest and most endangered species in Britain, and it has a particular relevance in Scotland. I developed a special affection for it during a recent and all-too-brief chairmanship of the Cairngorms Partnership Board.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para48"></a>A full count of the capercaillie took place in the winter of 1993-94. It established that there were only about 2,200 birds left in Britain, all of them in Scotland. The likelihood is that a further count carried out last winter will show a decline. However, the report of that count will not be available until later this year, probably in September. The species is also declining throughout its European range, where the latest estimate is that there are between 200,000 and 300,000 birds left.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para49"></a>We cannot be certain of the reasons for the decline in capercaillie numbers. The interesting speculations tonight point to the complexity of the causality. The <P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advice that we have received indicates that among the likely causes are cold, wet spring weather as well as, as we have heard, predation, collisions with deer fencing, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and reduction of food available to chicks through over-grazing by deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para50"></a>As the noble Lord is clearly aware, the Government are advised on natural heritage issues by Scottish Natural Heritage, the Government's statutory nature conservation advisers in Scotland. Its view, which we share, is that all possible measures are already in place to support the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para51"></a>In particular, the noble Lord asked about the creation of special protection areas for the capercaillie under the EC wild birds directive. Under the birds directive, EU member states are required to identify areas to be given special protection for rare or vulnerable species and for regularly occurring migratory species.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para52"></a>In fact, five sites for capercaillie have already been classified (the term used in the directive) as "special protection areas" for the capercaillie. Those sites, all of which, as I have said, are in Scotland, are: Abernethy Forest, the Cairngorms, Glen Tanar, Ballochbuie and Loch Lomond. They extend to a total area of some 61,000 hectares. In addition, one further site is under consideration for classification.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para53"></a>The Government have selected those sites, using the best scientific information available, to meet their international obligations and in doing so to give the special protection of classification to the areas which are most important to the capercaillie. In those areas, which are also designated as sites of special scientific interest, the Government are required by the birds directive to take appropriate steps to avoid pollution or deterioration of habitats or any disturbance to the birds which could be significant in relation to their survival and reproduction. Changes in management require to be notified to Scottish Natural Heritage, which may refuse consent, or advise refusal of consent, if there is a likely adverse effect on the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para54"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, also asks the Government to seek the capercaillie's rescheduling as a Schedule 1, Part II species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. I noted the scepticism of the noble Lord, Lord Monro, which, on the basis of present evidence, the Government may share.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para55"></a>Like all birds, the capercaillie is given general protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and as such it is an offence to kill, take or damage birds, nests and eggs, apart from those species listed under Schedule 2. But it is more complicated than that. The capercaillie is listed in Schedule 2, Part I of the 1981 Act, and this allows birds to be hunted outwith the close season prescribed in the Act. The noble Lord is looking for a change in this listing, to the effect that the capercaillie would be included in Part II of Schedule 1. Such inclusion would create a further offence of disturbing birds at their nest or their dependent young. Special penalties are provided for this offence and for killing or taking any birds listed in Schedule 1.
<P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para56"></a>At present, the Government have no plans to change the capercaillie's statutory protection by rescheduling it under the 1981 Act. Although the capercaillie is listed as a quarry species, there is in existence a voluntary, but very successful, ban on the shooting of capercaillie. This has been in place for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that no capercaillies are ever shot, but the number is likely to be very small indeed. As regards listing in Part II of Schedule 1, disturbance on or at the nest is not thought to be a factor which is contributing significantly to the capercaillie's decline.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para57"></a>We have not at this stage received any advice from Scottish Natural Heritage that changes to the statutory protection of the capercaillie are required. We are aware that it has the issue under consideration, and any further recommendations that it makes--I apologise in advance to the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay--will indeed, with a Scottish election just over a week away, be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para58"></a>In addition to measures taken under the birds directive and the protection given by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, a number of other actions are already being taken, both within and without designated areas, to help the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para59"></a>As I have already indicated, our advice is that the main threats to the capercaillie are loss of habitat, increased predation, collisions with deer fences and cold wet spring weather. As the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, noted, with the obvious exception of the weather, work on all those issues is being undertaken through the biodiversity species action plan. A steering group has been set up to oversee the implementation of the plan. That steering group is made up of representatives of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds--and I am delighted that the chairman, the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, is present to give us the benefit of his experience--and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, together with the Forestry Commission, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Landowners Federation and the Game Conservancy Trust.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para60"></a>The species action plan identifies a number of actions for the capercaillie. These include site safeguard and management measures; promotion of reduced deer fencing; the removal or marking of deer fencing; consideration of changes to the capercaillie's protected status; provision of advice to farmers and land managers on favourable methods of management; research and monitoring; and consideration of codes of practice. I understand also that a project manager is about to be appointed who will have the full-time job of advising landowners and managers on actions to help the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para61"></a>Many positive steps are being taken to monitor closely the progress of the capercaillie and to make sure that the measures that are in place are as effective as possible. Statutory protection under the 1981 Act and designation of special protection areas can make a contribution, but that will not be the whole answer. Therefore I commend the partners of the capercaillie biodiversity action plan on their efforts. They have succeeded already in stimulating awareness of the capercaillie's problems. That has been amply demonstrated in this debate.
<P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para62"></a>Perhaps I may turn to a few specific points which have been raised. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, raised the problem of fox snares. As I said, we believe that the educational process which is taking place through the biodiversity species action plans will help to ensure that snares are set more appropriately. Of course, foxes predate on capercaillie chicks and, as with all pest species, they must continue to be controlled.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para63"></a>The noble Lord asked also for more special protection area classifications. We already have the most important sites classified. Scottish Natural Heritage will consider suggestions but can only consider sites where birds are actually present.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para64"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, raised a number of matters. He asked about our international obligations in relation to this matter. EC directives are matters of international policy. Therefore, post devolution, they are reserved matters. However, the day-to-day implementation of EC directives is a devolved matter. It will be for the Scottish Parliament to consider ongoing bird and habitat directives and issues arising from them, including continuing measures to help the capercaillie.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para65"></a>I was asked about the Forestry Commission and what aid may be available. Funds for a wide range of measures are available, including the removal of redundant deer fences which are hazardous to capercaillie and for funding the marking necessary. I was impressed by the low cost of the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Burton, that it may be cheaper to do as people did in the past; that is, tie a bunch of heather to the fences. But grants are also available for fence marking, which will help to reduce the number of fence collisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para66"></a>In answer to the comments of the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, on grants being made available to all capercaillie areas, that will indeed be the case. The <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>28 Apr 1999 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>woodland improvement grants may be available throughout the capercaillie range for suitable woodlands. The Cairngorm Partnership Area Challenge Fund, introduced by the Forestry Commission in 1996, provides extra funding which should benefit the capercaillie. I thank the noble Earl for his suggestions as regards increasing funding elsewhere. I shall certainly pass on his suggestions about the Scottish forestry strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para67"></a>As regards the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, on alternatives to conventional fencing, I note that a number of trials are already under way. The noble Lord, Lord Kimball, mentioned pine martens. They are one of our rarest remaining Scottish mammals. I am advised by our boffins--not those of the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, in this case--that as yet there is no strong evidence from Scottish Natural Heritage that pine martens have a significant effect on capercaillie numbers. We believe that foxes and crows are the main predators.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para68"></a>As I reach the end of my allotted time, perhaps I may say--unconvincingly--that I would have liked the time to address the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Monro, on raptors. However, I know from my experience in the Cairngorm Partnership that for a man to get involved in an argument about raptors when the chairman of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is in the room is probably a dangerous occupation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428-16_para69"></a>Perhaps noble Lords will allow me to end by again thanking the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for bringing this important matter to our attention. I am sure it has been very educative, certainly for government. I was very amused by the story of the potato-stuffed birds. I just hope that in the enumeration of all the causes of decline he has not added Retsina-flavoured fowl.

<A NAME="90428w01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Military action is being taken only as a last resort to seek to end a humanitarian catastrophe and secure a lasting peace for the Balkans. All civilian deaths are a tragedy. But a key NATO aim has been to keep civilian casualties to
a minimum, in contrast to the deliberate targeting of civilians by Serbian security forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "90428w01_para5"></a>NATO has clearly set out its conditions for a cessation of military action. President Milosevic knows what he must do if he continues to reject the path of peace and pursue a military strategy. NATO will continue to degrade his forces' ability to repress.

<A NAME="90428w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   There is no statutory definition of what constitutes a war crime. However offences committed in the course of armed conflict, both international and otherwise, may be prosecuted under the Geneva Convention Act of 1957. And where the relief or aid worker is deemed to be a member of the United Nations, as defined by the Act, action may also be taken under the United Nations Personnel Act 1997.
