<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What conclusions have so far been drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry monitoring unit on directors&#039; remuneration, since the unit was set up last February.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made a Written Statement to Parliament about directors&#039; remuneration, performance contracts and severance on 25 February 2004, announcing that   the Department of Trade and Industry would commission an external assessment of compliance with the Directors&#039; Remuneration Report Regulations and changes in remuneration practices during the course of this year&#039;s AGM season. Deloitte & Touche has been appointed to this role and will submit its reports to the department this autumn.
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply, and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for not jumping the gun. The <i>Guardian </i>reported a 288 per cent increase in remuneration levels over the past 10 years compared with an increase in average earnings of 45 per cent. Top remuneration packages of such a magnitude are, frankly, looting investors. It is time that the Government did not outsource inquiries on such issues. I think that the senior partner in Deloitte is among the fat cats about whom we are talking, so I hope that the company declares an interest when it gives its assessment.

</p>

<a name="40916-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Failure continues to be rewarded. We have seen it this week in the cases of Jarvis directors and Sir Peter Davis at Sainsbury. It makes a mockery of good corporate governance. The Government cannot keep hiding behind assessments and so on. They should deal with this problem and amend the Companies Act, as the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, indicated in his reply to me on 25 February. Does the Minister not agree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that there was a question right at the end, although I very much enjoyed the diatribe. As the noble Lord indicated, there are statistics going back over a number of years, which is why the regulations were introduced two years ago. During the first year in which the regulations have been effective, shareholders have had <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1286</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the chance at annual general meetings to hold companies to account in these terms and considerable progress has been made. There will always be one or two instances that hit the headlines; the noble Lord referred to one of them. The regulations are effecting beneficial change. It is only right that we await Deloitte & Touche&#039;s report to obtain its analysis of how the system works and whether emendation is necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I was merely signalling earlier my intention to ask a helpful question, albeit in a somewhat unorthodox manner.
</p>

<a name="40916-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Some of us have doubts about the doctrine of shareholder democracy. There is a lot of evidence that remuneration committees operate, not against market forces, but in an oligopoly. Research shows that in many cases they operate the upper-quartile principle, which in layman&#039;s language means, &quot;You scratch my back; I&#039;ll scratch yours&quot;. I suspect that that will apply to Deloitte & Touche&#039;s report also, but I hope that I am wrong. Will the Minister take on board that we need the unit to do some serious work about the operation of remuneration committees, having regard to the fact that the issue is increasingly becoming a national scandal and that it will be very hard to retain moral support for income restraint across the rest of the economy if it goes on like this?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I recognise my noble friend&#039;s impatience, indicated by his eagerness to put his question. I have some sympathy with his statement and with that of the noble Lord, Lord Smith, that previous abuses have caused considerable public concern. I reiterate my response to the first Question: we await an analysis of the position. We are encouraged by what has occurred over the past 15 months. Greater openness is making issues more transparent to shareholders, and in some well publicised cases it has resulted in significant second thoughts by the board. I hear what my noble friend says. I am sure that, after many years of showing considerable patience, the noble Lord will be able to extend it for the short period until we have the benefit of the report. Then we will be able to look further at the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, I would welcome elucidation on an aspect of the subject that has always puzzled me. If shareholders do not like the way that a company in which they have put their money is run, for whatever reason, why cannot they sell the shares and transfer their affections?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that probably goes on. It has not gone unnoticed that one of the companies that is currently in the limelight because of its remuneration of directors has seen, for all sorts of reasons, a massive decline in its share price, which is a reflection of loss of confidence. Withdrawal from the fray is one condign action that shareholders can take but surely it would be better for the health of companies and the good of the economy if shareholders were <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40916-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My Lords, we have not yet heard from the Conservative Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, is there any thinking that perhaps the make-up of the members of the remuneration committee should be looked at? Under the combined code, the audit committees now have to be made up of members who have financial competence in areas such as accountancy and banking, for example. There could be a case for suggesting to corporations that members of the remuneration committee should likewise be well versed in all the intricacies of remuneration. In that way, we might avoid the very prevalent trend of going for upper quartile for non-upper quartile performance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I recognise the noble Baroness&#039;s point about the complexities of remuneration. The report from Deloitte & Touche, which we await with some eagerness, will no doubt have significant things to say about the make-up of remuneration committees, their competence and, to reflect the point of my noble friend Lord Lea, whether they are sufficiently representative.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40916-01_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Beaumont of Whitley </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What steps they are taking to ensure that disabled residents living on unadopted roads will be able to take full advantage of the provisions in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the provisions of the draft Disability Discrimination Bill would place public authorities under a duty not to discriminate against disabled people when exercising any of their functions and would require them to promote equality of opportunity. Local authorities have no mandatory duties in respect of unadopted roads, and the Bill&#039;s provisions would not change that position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord to a certain extent for that Answer. I know that he knows that there are about 40,000 unadopted roads in England, because we have discussed this before. Does he know that many of them, particularly in the north of England, are in such a state of disrepair <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1288"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1288</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and are so badly lit that disabled people cannot safely leave their houses? Does he not think that it is time that the national Government should fill this breach in our welfare provisions by taking over responsibility?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40916-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, when the noble Lord says that I know that there are 40,000 unadopted roads in the United Kingdom, I do so on the basis of 1972 statistics, which are the latest we have.
</p>

<a name="40916-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>In response to the noble Lord&#039;s broader point, he will recognise that it is for frontagers on such roads to make up their mind whether the road is sufficiently secure for them to go about their business. If there are disabled people who have particular difficulties, they must get together with their neighbours to approach the local authority. But if local authorities took on every single unadopted road in this country, the cost would be &#163;3 billion. That is a mighty large slice out of the transport budget.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040916/text/40916-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that such confusion within a major piece of disability legislation is one of the major problems in this field? Are the Government prepared at least to clarify the situation when the Bill comes before Parliament? At the moment, it appears that you are allowed to travel if you are disabled unless you need to go to an address on an unadopted road.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Bill relates to public transport and the obligations upon public transport to guarantee that disabled people can travel as readily as anyone else. However, public transport does not ply down unadopted roads, in the main, for fairly obvious reasons. I repeat that if we accepted a public responsibility for all unadopted roads, it would be a major cost which would be difficult to justify when we know that very large numbers of unadopted roads are in that state because the frontagers are determined that they should remain that way. That is their decision and their right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister also answered the last Question from the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, on unadopted roads, will he let me add a footnote to my quotation from Betjeman on that occasion, to which he responded? I have since verified that Miss Joan Hunter Dunn was the catering manager at the Ministry of Information during the war, based in Senate House at the University of London, where Betjeman served for a short period.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the whole House is always grateful for any information we get from the noble Lord, but on this occasion we are doubly grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the clarification of providers of goods and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1289"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1289</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

services might be an avenue for the Government to consider? We do not want to go to case-made law to sort this out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Lord says. He will recognise that the Bill we are introducing has had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny, which will aid its passage through Parliament. The House will have its opportunity to consider the legislation, when all these points will be taken into account. However, I understand what the noble Lord says about road surfaces and services to the disabled in our community. We shall certainly discuss those points when the Bill is before us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   My Lords, how does the Minister know what the cost of adopting all the roads is when he does not have an up-to-date catalogue?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is a fair point. We are in the land of conjecture and guesswork on this issue, because we do not keep an up-to-date register of unadopted roads because they are not of public concern, nor is there any public expenditure on them. They are private roads with private rights. However, we have that figure from 1972. Only a small number of roads move from the unadopted to the adopted category each year. When one speaks of billions, it is from a vague perspective on a large number of roads. When each one is now adopted, we have a yardage cost that gives us a chance to produce a broad instrument. However, I am not of course defending the figures as categorical.

Copies of that response have been placed in the Library. We welcome the 30 recommendations of the committee, which contribute towards our commitment to ensuring that, over time, palliative care is available to all who need it, irrespective of diagnosis and in whatever setting they are receiving care.

<a name="40916-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and the Government for their response to the report. I declare an interest as one who works in palliative care. The Government&#039;s response recognises that funding has been inequitable and over-reliant on the voluntary sector. How will service planning be equitable without central co-ordination, particularly in exploring Marie Curie&#039;s model, and how will the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is worth bearing in mind that the Health Select Committee praised the initiatives that the Government have taken to double the palliative care workforce. They have invested &#163;50 million through the NHS Cancer Plan and provided specific funding for black and ethnic community projects and services for children. We have been working with Marie Curie on its economic model, which contains some interesting ideas. However, we recognise, as does Marie Curie, that some practical issues surround that particular model. As the Government&#039;s response shows, we are also taking issues forward as fast as is possible and practicable on a co-operative basis with the voluntary sector.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, do the Government have plans to ensure that &quot;whatever setting&quot; includes facilities for those people who exercise their choice to die in their own home?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Yes, my Lords, we support that approach. Following their commitment in the <i>Building on the Best End of Life Care Initiative</i>, the Government will be investing an additional &#163;12 million during the next three years to improve care for people coming to the end of their lives, irrespective of diagnosis and setting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that some GP surgeries are putting a charge on nursing advice for those people who are living at home and who have to acquire nurses through agencies? Is that fair?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, this is the first that I have heard of this problem. I am not briefed to give an authoritative answer, but I shall certainly look into the matter and write to the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew14"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, when one thinks of palliative care, one perhaps thinks most immediately of care for cancer patients, but there are many patients with other terminal conditions where palliative care is necessary. What work are the Government doing with the various non-cancer voluntary organisations to ensure that the programme for enhancing palliative care is rolled out equitably?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have a range of contacts in the voluntary sector. As the noble Earl rightly said, we are committed to extending palliative care to people irrespective of their diagnosis. It is right that the major effort thus far has been made in relation to patients who suffer from cancer, but we are taking the issue forward on a co-operative basis with the voluntary sector and, after a cross-cutting review, the Government are committed to full cost recovery in the voluntary sector, which will help in this area.

</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is always important to ensure good co-operation between social services and health services at the local level. There have been major advances in palliative care, which reflect rather well on co-operative working between the two services. That is reflected in the Health Select Committee&#039;s report. I am not quite as pessimistic as my noble friend because we have seen an expanding range of palliative care services in the community and in hospices. The trend is ever upwards. We are seeing good relationships also with the voluntary sector.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, in light of the Minister&#039;s previous point, does he agree that there is a widespread public misconception that palliative care is provided only in hospices and hospitals? Does he accept that palliative care is a philosophy of care that is increasingly extending out into the community? The public are to some extent misinformed about that. Does he accept that extending palliative care into the community is a major priority for the future?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40916-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, as so often, is absolutely right. The end-of-life care initiative that I mentioned will enable us also to skill up existing staff who already contribute to supportive and palliative care. Many of them are working to help people who wish to exercise their choice to die at home. I remind the House that the Government have provided 67,500 extra nurses since 1997. That is enabling us to increase the number of district nurses and palliative care nurse specialists, all of whom will be able to expand services for people who want to die at home.

It has made changes recently which will give more than 2 million taxpayers an easier task. Many will no longer be required to complete a return, and others will be able to use a short tax return. The Inland Revenue has also enhanced the online system to offer taxpayers a wider range of services.

<a name="40916-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the number of people who file electronically is increasing every year. There were over 1 million at the end of January this year; 1,080,000, I think. The total number of self-assessments is 9.5 million out of 30 million. My understanding is that Inland Revenue targets have been met in previous years.

<a name="40916-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the use of the Internet for making tax returns. Can my noble friend tell me how many taxpayers pay through the Internet and how many taxpayers receive statements of account via the Internet when it is requested by them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I do not have that figure. Clearly, the people who file via the Internet&#151;I have already given a figure of over 1 million&#151;must be given an opportunity to pay over the Internet when they have to pay. Of course, the number of people who pay other than by PAYE is a very small proportion of all taxpayers.

<a name="40916-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us whether the Inland Revenue is gaining or losing by self-assessment?

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, both taxpayers and the Inland Revenue are gaining by self-assessment. Taxpayers are gaining because they have less work to do and the Inland Revenue is gaining because the costs are less. I should add that when a return is filed over the Internet, it is analysed electronically. It does not have to return to paper and pencil in order to be calculated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is evidence that the number of tax inquiries launched by the Inland Revenue has dramatically increased in recent times? Is this something that is due to the introduction of self-assessment or is it due to some other reason?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, means by &quot;tax inquiries&quot;. If they are the checks carried out by the Inland Revenue on discrepancies, then I am not sure that that is the case. But it could also mean checks that are made when there is a suspicion of a filing being deliberately inaccurate. In view of that ambiguity, I would rather write to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, about that point.

<a name="40916-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   My Lords, given my noble friend&#039;s Answer, and given that filing online is a purely voluntary activity, so that those who might have security concerns would obviously not do it that way, why can the Government not make an immediate decision and allow us all to file online right away? Is it because governments do not make immediate decisions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1294</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

filing is a little more complicated than that. There are two types of online filing. One is the original, which was introduced about 10 years ago and was mainly designed for advisers. The second is the Internet filing provision for individual taxpayers, which was introduced three or four years ago. To reconcile those, in order to make online filing possible for everybody, is a little more complicated than might appear.

<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, in terms of the credibility of the system, will the Minister raise with the Inland Revenue the possibility of introducing <i>de minimis</i> limits in terms of fines for late payments? At present, if one submits a late claim for a repayment, one can get a demand for a fine of &#163;0.00. This clearly brings the system into disrepute. Will the Minister consider that point?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40916-03_spnew19"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, my understanding is that there are special arrangements for anything less that &#163;2,000. I may be out of date on that. It sounds a sensible point and I shall look into it.

<a name="40916-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Brook of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, as we have a moment to spare, may I commend to the Treasury Bench a novel system of self-assessment? When my late noble kinsman was Financial Secretary to the Treasury, 50 years ago, he received a letter from an anonymous taxpayer. It said that he had been losing much sleep and had come to the conclusion that the loss of sleep was caused by his inaccurate tax reporting. He enclosed a banker&#039;s draft for &#163;50,000 and added a postscript saying that if he continued to lose sleep, he would send some more.

(b)   any duty imposed under section (Power to require estate agents to belong to a redress scheme)(1),&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Lord said: With this amendment, we will discuss a host of other government amendments relating to estate agents. The introduction of home information packs will enhance the role for estate agents in the home buying and selling process. Agents will be marketing homes with home information packs and will also have the opportunity to be pack providers. As we have discussed in relation to earlier amendments, home information packs will cover a range of documents and information that is important to sellers and buyers and, indeed, to the whole transaction process. For probably the first time, agents will have full information about the property when the property is marketed. This will put agents in a central and highly influential position.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that the recent report from the Office of Fair Trading found a high degree of consumer dissatisfaction with estate agents. Among the report&#039;s recommendations was a suggestion that a power should be taken to impose a statutory redress scheme for use if voluntary codes of practice did not bring about sufficient improvement.

</p>

<a name="40916-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The OFT investigation and resulting report were largely concerned with the role of estate agents in the home buying and selling process as it exists today. The introduction of home information packs makes the imperative of a more effective consumer redress even more pressing.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The provisions set out in this group of government amendments are a variant of the OFT recommendation. They give the Secretary of State powers to approve one or more redress schemes and thereafter to require, by order, estate agents to become members of such a scheme. They provide also for the Secretary of State to withdraw any such approval. It would be open to any organisation or person to seek the Secretary of State&#039;s approval for a redress scheme. There could be more than one approved scheme. We hope that redress schemes will be run by the industry itself. We are holding discussions with the industry to bring this about. If it is necessary&#151;although we hope that it will not be&#151;the Secretary of State could establish a scheme himself. Sellers and buyers would be able to make complaints. The process would be independent and free to complainants. Members of an approved redress scheme would be under an obligation to abide by any recommendation or sanction resulting from an adjudication on a complaint.

</p>

<a name="40916-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Amendments Nos. 210ZA and 210ZB are consequential. They provide for local weights and measures authorities to enforce the duty to belong to a redress scheme, in addition to enforcing other duties relating to home information packs. We envisage that redress schemes may also operate on a voluntary basis. This voluntary element could relate to activities that are not connected with agents&#039; activities with regard to home information packs.

</p>

<a name="40916-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Because this is a new proposal on which the Government have yet to consult&#151;and brand new for the other place&#151;we would not propose to exercise the power until it was clear what industry scheme or schemes would seek approval and what arrangements they would have for providing redress, including the fees that they would charge estate agents. Consultation needs to be carried out on the detailed arrangements, and a full regulatory impact assessment completed.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We are bringing forward this package of amendments as part of the package of measures that the Government announced in our response to the OFT report. The Department of Trade and Industry will also consult on proposals to improve transparency in this market and make enforcement of the legislation more effective. This is an important and timely consumer protection measure; it would provide consumers with an effective redress when estate agents marketing homes with packs fail to match up to the high standards of care that home buyers and sellers need.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I do not want to make long speeches, but this is a brand new package so it is important to put as much on the record as possible. There is a fairly narrow scope to the amendments and we do not really want to widen it; however, the House may wish to widen it&#151;though after proper scrutiny, of course, not at this stage. We have sought to take maximum advantage of the opportunity provided by this Bill to bring forward this amendment to facilitate the introduction of a redress scheme. Of course, that means that we are, or were, constrained by the scope of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Bill is about marketing homes for sale with home information packs. Once it is in force we expect that the business of buying and selling a home will be heavily influenced, if not dominated, by the additional presence of home information packs. Consequently, the landscape will also change for estate agents. Many of the problems that cause consumers to complain may decline or even cease as a result of the packs. Equally some new problems may surface that the redress scheme will be called upon to take account of.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Therefore, it is difficult now, before home information packs are in place, to say what problems will arise that the redress scheme will cover. However, marketing homes for sale is probably the area that has given rise to most of the dissatisfaction&#151;though not all of it&#151;that consumers feel about estate agents. The redress measure will cover&#151;and this is set out in subsection (6)(b)&#151;an,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;act or omission affecting the complainant in the course of the estate agent&#039;s activities in relation to a home information pack that is (or will be) required for that property (including the giving of advice as to whether such a pack is required)&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40916-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>It simply is not possible, within the scope of this Bill at present, to provide for redress schemes to cover all estate agents&#039; activities&#151;for example, commercial sales. But if it is the mood of the House that the scope of the scheme is more narrow than it needs to be, we will be more than happy to reflect on the matter further. In any event, we anticipate that those compiling redress schemes will expand their scope on a voluntary basis. Subsection (5) specifically allows for this. It makes it clear that these provisions do not prevent approved schemes from providing for the investigation and determination of complaints about other matters when members&#151;that is, estate agents&#151;have voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of the scheme over such complaints.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Thus there is a real opportunity to expand the coverage of redress schemes beyond the requirements of this amendment. We will be exploring this further in the context of the consultations that the Government will be undertaking on this measure and the wider issues arising from the OFT report. But the final decision, of course, rests not with any technocrat, but with this House. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40916-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   The Minister&#039;s explanation of the amendments is very welcome. As he said, this is an important part of the Bill, which is being inserted at quite a late stage and which it will be the responsibility of this House to see through.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I have a couple of worries. One is that the redress scheme seems to be, by any other name, a complaints system. Will the Minister confirm that that is the situation? If that is so, it is a very poor second guess at having estate agents registered and licensed. If it is a complaints system, the Minister is probably right in believing that there will be pressure to extend the scope more widely, rather than limiting it to the home information packs. It may be worth tabling an amendment and discussing the implications of making the scope wider, to cover the activities of estate agents.
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The Minister might be kind enough to respond to another thought I had when he was introducing the amendment. It was not something we discussed when we talked about the home information packs. Is it a <i>sine qua non</i> that estate agents will always be the people who put the packs together? Off the top of my head, I cannot see why a solicitor should not do that. After a home inspector has been instructed to get the report done, is there any reason why a solicitor should not complete them? In that case, will the redress scheme be wide enough on that basis, too?
</p>

<a name="40916-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I am not being unwelcoming of the amendments, which are moving in the right direction, although they will probably need expanding at the next stage, when we can discuss them a little further. In the mean time, perhaps the Minister would consider whether this is not a rather limited response to the pressure that we applied over estate agents&#039; registration, and whether the measure should be extended to anyone who is putting together the home information packs.

<a name="40916-05_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   We, too, welcome the Government&#039;s efforts. This issue is quite difficult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1298"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1298</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because, as with other amendments, this is the first time that we have discussed them, and we have not had long to consider them. However, I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s explanation of why the scope is so limited, and why the provision deals with home information packs alone. That creates a difficulty for us, after the discussions that we have had so far. The nature of the Bill is such that trying to widen the scheme to the activities of estate agents not only associated with the home information packs is actually quite difficult. The Minister alluded to that in his last sentence.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I welcome the Minister&#039;s comment that we should not be ruled by technocrats, but I believe that there will be a problem. The National Association of Estate Agents has been advising me; it welcomes what the Government have done so far but along with others would like to see all aspects of the buying and selling process encompassed.

</p>

<a name="40916-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>It will be difficult to get to grips with the issue because Parliament will not be sitting for the next three weeks and some of us have other commitments. I hope that it will not come up in the first week when we are back, so maybe we will be able to get to grips with it. I can see that we are going to have more arguments about how we get down anything that we can discuss to widen the scheme. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is of the same view. The estate agents would like to see it wider, and I think I am correct that the DTI was hoping for a wider scheme. We will have to put our heads around it. That is the main disappointment; we are pleased about the rest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40916-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   Perhaps I may express a word of welcome for the new clause that the Minister has in mind. The scheme intended is both a complaint and a redress scheme. The existing ombudsman for estate agents scheme, which has been operative for 14 years and is the most obvious existing scheme&#151;I do not think that there are any others&#151;to be approved by the Government for the purposes of the new clause offers redress as a response to complaints about estate agents who are members of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Unfortunately, the scheme does not have in its membership anywhere near as many estate agents as one would like. It does not quite cover 50 per cent of the total market. I declare a past interest: I was for some years a member of the council on the ombudsman for estate agents under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lady Mallalieu. I believe that the present chairman is the former Conservative Cabinet Minister the right honourable Gillian Shephard. She has continued the valuable work of the voluntary ombudsman scheme as it is as the moment.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>It seems the most obvious scheme to receive government approval. No doubt the Government and the Benches opposite favour competition in the supply of goods and services, but I am not sure that it is such a good idea to have competition among those who offer redress facilities. It would probably be rather confusing, and there would be a risk of inconsistency in decisions and so on if two or more systems were operating.

</p>

<a name="40916-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The Minister and the two speakers from the Opposition Front Benches have noted that the proposal is limited to complaints or redress in relation to home information packs. It may be a much better idea, if one can properly fit it into the Bill, if it were widened beyond that, because I am sure that the Committee will feel that if there were a redress scheme working well, worthy of government approval and so on, it would be far better that that scheme go across all complaints concerning estate agents&#151;at any rate in the residential property market&#151;and not just the narrow complaints against estate agents in respect of home information packs.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The new clause would be better if it did not have the limitation that it has. Let us hope that a way can be found in the next few weeks for devising such. At any rate, for reasons that I have already indicated, it would be sensible to have one code of practice for the ombudsman or whomever rather than a number of rival codes, otherwise there will be a certain amount of inconsistency.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Finally, perhaps I may draw the Committee&#039;s attention to a recently published White Paper from the Department for Constitutional Affairs entitled <i>Transforming Public Services: Complaints, Redress and Tribunals</i>&#151;Command Paper 6243, published two months ago. There is a chapter of commendation of various existing public and private sector ombudsman schemes. Towards the end of the report, it says that one of the objectives of government in this field should be consistent and comprehensible decisions.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>We will obtain consistent and comprehensible decisions only if we have one scheme approved that is worthy of approval in the matter that the Government want to cover, and preferably rather wider than the Government have in the present new clause, so that all activities of estate agents in relation to residential property are included.

<a name="40916-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am grateful for the comments, and I shall do my best to answer the brief number of questions. Yes, it is a complaints system. There is already a regulatory system for estate agents that the Government are committed to improving, following the report of the Office of Fair Trading. It is more than a complaints system. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is right that estate agents will not always put together the packs. Solicitors could do so; and the advantage is that they are already covered by a redress scheme. Of all the bodies involved, it happens that estate agents are not covered. They fall through the net completely. Solicitors are covered by the legal services ombudsman. I cannot spell it out any more clearly: the Government are looking for some help in getting the provision wider than we have presented it today. I invite the Committee to consider that over the next three weeks before Report.

<a name="40916-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   This grouping is intended to probe the Minister over enforcement in relation to packs. Unsurprisingly, given our general apprehension about the packs and their current mandatory nature, we are concerned that failure to provide a pack would result in possible enforcement action. That appears to be an &quot;all stick and no carrot&quot; approach.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>If, as the Minister has tried to assure us throughout our discussions, people will accept and indeed embrace the packs, why do the Government feel it necessary to include what can only be seen as a set of draconian measures? Surely if what he says is true, there would be no need for such legislation. If there are to be packs, they should be voluntary, which would obviously preclude the need for this section on enforcement.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Minister could additionally clarify some of the detail, which appears vague, in the section. For instance, exactly how much would a penalty charge be? What would be the grounds for a person having,

</p>

<a name="40916-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>to have a pack, as set out in Clause 147(5)? Who and what would be an enforcement officer? How exactly is the section to be enforced? How will the necessary authorities know if someone has a home information pack? Not only are we opposed to this section of the Bill as it stands, but it is sufficiently vague to give rise to considerable confusion both among home sellers and the individuals who are supposed to enforce such draconian measures. I would therefore welcome the Minister&#039;s thoughts.

<a name="40916-05_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   On enforcement my question is not so much about sticks and carrots, although the Minister may think that the answer is about sticks and carrots.

<a name="40916-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The answer to that last question is yes. I shall give an example. We are dealing here with a narrow point relating to Clause 146 to which I referred earlier. The matter would be enforced by the local weights and measures authorities. The vast majority of people abide by the law. However, there will always be some who want to cut corners if they see an opportunity to do so. As we have said, failure to comply with the home information pack duties would impact on all other transactions in a chain. We are dealing here not with the individual transaction of the buyer and seller of one property. As I said, the average chain comprises four properties. Therefore, other people are affected. That is why effective enforcement is essential.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Local authority trading standards officers will play the major role in this respect. They are ideally placed to carry out this function. They are already responsible for enforcing the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 and parts of the Estate Agents Act 1979. The enforcement of the home information pack duties is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1301"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1301</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

complementary to those activities. I am not aware of people complaining about the duties they already take on and enforce.
</p>

<a name="40916-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Trading standards officers are the front line of consumer protection in a whole host of activities. People might ask what the state is doing in that regard. Trading standards officers are the front-line troops in terms of health and safety and food, for example. They have a fantastic range of expertise. I never see any reports that their duties are onerous or oppressive. They get on and do the job. Most trading standards officers will follow the law and add the duty that we are discussing to the activities they carry out under the two property-related Acts that they already enforce. Therefore, we do not envisage any major difficulty in that regard at all.

<a name="40916-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Will the Minister clarify the matter? I am the leader of an authority whose trading standards department will carry out this work. We mainly carry out spot checks. How does the Minister expect the measure to operate? As we have said several times, about 1.4 million homes change hands every year. That will involve 1.4 million home information packs. Does the Minister expect trading standards officers to double check that every home has one, or will there be spot checks? There may be an army of trading standards officers looking at 1.4 million packs. At the moment such laws are mainly enforced through spot checks rather than, for example, checking every pub to ensure that its staff are serving the correct measures, or checking every shop to ensure that its staff are selling the correct items.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40916-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I do not see the problem. I note that I am being asked that question by a good leader of a major, well run authority. He is asking Ministers to tell professional local government officers how to do their job. They will do the job in the same way they do it now. First, they will presumably operate on the basis of complaints from the public, because that is what trading standards officers do. Secondly, they will police the system on the basis of the risk that they countenance from the areas they are asked to police.
</p>

<a name="40916-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The noble Lord asks me whether trading standards officers will check every one of the 40,000 dwellings that go on sale every week. I should be astonished if the answer to that was yes as that would be an abject waste of their professional time. They will look at the risks, add their policing role to their existing roles and operate on the basis of complaints from the public, or complaints from other people. They will carry that out in the same professional way as Essex trading standards officers carry out their existing duties. So far as I can see, there will be no difference.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40916-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   Relating to the production of the documents in a visible and legible documentary form, when the trading standards officer wants to verify that a particular document exists, why should it not be satisfactory for the person who holds that document simply to show it to him in electronic form? It is not necessary for the purpose of ascertaining that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1302"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1302</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

document exists to print out the 200 pages or whatever it may consist of. One could simply show it to the enforcement officer as it exists on the hard disk of the particular estate agent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40916-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The noble Lord is asking me almost to prescribe the way in which the job should be done. I do not know how trading standards officers will assess what documents are in the pack. That will be for them to assess. If they are prepared to accept information in an electronic format, that is up to them. That is the way of the world. I am confident that trading standards officers will do their job professionally. I shall not try to second-guess them.

</p>

<a name="40916-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I refer to the amount of penalty prescribed by the Secretary of State. The Bill as amended sets a maximum of &#163;500. We have in mind setting the charge initially at about &#163;200. The trading standards officers&#039; primary enforcement role will be to inform and advise. A penalty will be issued only as a last resort. Trading standards officers are extremely helpful to the industries that they police.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40916-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. We still do not agree with the whole provision as we consider that the packs should be voluntary. If they were voluntary, they would not need to be policed. However, I thank the Minister for his comments as they indicate that no one is expected to police every single pack. I am grateful for that useful comment.

<br>
(2)   The order comes into force when it is made.


<br>
(3)   The order ceases to have effect at the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which it is made, unless it ceases to have effect at some other time as mentioned below.


<br>
(4)   If the order provides that it is to cease to have effect on a date falling before the end of that period, it accordingly ceases to have effect on that date.

<br>
(6)   If the date on which the final EDMO comes into force in relation to the dwelling following the disposal of the appeal is later than the date on which the interim EDMO would cease to have effect apart from this sub-paragraph, the interim EDMO continues in force until that later date.


<br>
(7)   If, on the application of the authority, the tribunal makes an order providing for the interim EDMO to continue in force, pending the disposal of the appeal, until a date later than that on which the interim EDMO would cease to have effect apart from this sub-paragraph, the interim EDMO accordingly continues in force until that later date.


<br>
(8)   This paragraph has effect subject to paragraphs 6 and 7 (variation or revocation of orders by authority) and to the power of revocation exercisable by a residential property tribunal on an appeal made under paragraph 30.

<br>
(d)   may apply to a residential property tribunal for an order under paragraph 22 determining a lease or licence of the dwelling.

(4)   But the authority may not under sub-paragraph (3)(c) create any interest or right in the nature of a lease or licence unless&#151;


<br>
(a)   consent in writing has been given by the relevant proprietor of the dwelling, and

<br>
(a)   the relevant proprietor, and


<br>
(b)   other persons with an estate or interest in the dwelling, 


<br>

<br>
(2)   Where the relevant proprietor is a lessor or licensor under a lease or licence of the dwelling, the lease or licence has effect while the order is in force as if the local housing authority were substituted in it for the lessor or licensor.


<br>
(3)   Such a lease continues to have effect, as far as possible, as a lease despite the fact that the rights of the local housing authority, as substituted for the lessor, do not amount to an estate in law in the dwelling.

(4)   The provisions mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) do not apply to a lease or licence within sub-paragraph (2).

<br>
(b)   section 124 of the Housing Act 1996 (c. 52) (introductory tenancies).


<br>
(7)   The relevant proprietor of the dwelling&#151;


<br>
(a)   is not entitled to receive any rents or other payments made in respect of occupation of the dwelling;


<br>
(b)   may not exercise any rights or powers with respect to the management of the dwelling; and


<br>
(c)   may not create any of the following&#151;

6   (1)   The local housing authority may vary an interim EDMO if they consider it appropriate to do so.


<br>
(2)   A variation does not come into force until such time, if any, as is the operative time for the purposes of this sub-paragraph under paragraph 33 (time when period for appealing expires without an appeal being made or when decision to vary is confirmed on appeal).


<br>
(3)   The power to vary an order under this paragraph is exercisable by the authority either&#151;


<br>
(a)   on an application made by a relevant person, or


<br>
(b)   on the authority&#039;s own initiative.


<br>
(4)   In this paragraph &quot;relevant person&quot; means any person who has an estate or interest in the dwelling (other than a person who is a tenant under a lease or licence granted under paragraph 2(3)(c)).


<br>
7   (1)   The local housing authority may revoke an interim EDMO in the following cases&#151;


<br>
(a)   where the authority conclude that there are no steps which they could appropriately take for the purpose of securing that the dwelling is occupied (see section (Local housing authority&#039;s duties once interim EDMO in force)(4));


<br>
(b)   where the authority are satisfied that&#151;


<br>
(i)   the dwelling will either become or continue to be occupied, despite the order being revoked, or


<br>
(ii)   that the dwelling is to be sold; 


<br>
(c)   where a final EDMO has been made by the authority in respect of the dwelling so as to replace the order;

(d)   where the authority conclude that it would be appropriate to revoke the order in order to prevent or stop interference with the rights of a third party in consequence of the order; and


<br>
(e)   where in any other circumstances the authority consider it appropriate to revoke the order.


<br>
(2)   But, in a case where the dwelling is occupied, the local housing authority may not revoke an interim EDMO under sub-paragraph (1)(b), (d) or (e) unless the relevant proprietor consents.


<br>
(3)   A revocation does not come into force until such time, if any, as is the operative time for the purposes of this sub-paragraph under paragraph 33 (time when period for appealing expires without an appeal being made or when decision to revoke is confirmed on appeal).


<br>
(4)   The power to revoke an order under this paragraph is exercisable by the authority either&#151;


<br>
(a)   on an application made by a relevant person, or

   &quot;POWER TO REQUIRE ESTATE AGENTS TO BELONG TO A REDRESS SCHEME

<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State may by order require every estate agent to be a member of an approved redress scheme.


<br>
(2)   Acting as estate agent for the seller of a residential property in contravention of such an order is a breach of duty under this Part.


<br>
(3)   Before making such an order the Secretary of State must be satisfied that he has approved one or more redress schemes such that every estate agent who is (or will be) subject to the duty imposed by the order is eligible to join an approved redress scheme.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1324"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1324</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
For this purpose &quot;estate agent&quot; does not include a person who is (by virtue of a prohibition imposed by or under the Estate Agents Act 1979 (c. 38)) unable lawfully to act as estate agent for the seller of a residential property.

<br>
(4)   An order under this section may&#151;


<br>
(a)   exclude estate agents of a prescribed description from any duty imposed under subsection (1);


<br>
(b)   limit any duty so imposed so that it applies only in relation to relevant complaints of a prescribed description.


<br>
(5)   Nothing in this section is to be taken as preventing an approved redress scheme from providing&#151;


<br>
(a)   for membership to be open to persons who are not subject to any duty to belong to an approved redress scheme;


<br>
(b)   for the investigation and determination of complaints, other than those in relation to which such a duty applies, made against members who have voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of the scheme over such complaints;


<br>
(c)   for the exclusion from investigation and determination under the scheme of any complaint in such cases or circumstances as may be specified in the scheme.


<br>
(6)   In this section and sections (Approval of redress schemes) and (Withdrawal of approval)&#151;


<br>
&quot;approved redress scheme&quot; means a redress scheme that is for the time being approved under section (Approval of redress schemes);


<br>
&quot;estate agent&quot; means a person who acts as estate agent for sellers of residential properties for which a home information pack is (or will be) required under this Part;


<br>
&quot;redress scheme&quot; means a scheme under which certain relevant complaints may be investigated and determined by an independent person (referred to in those sections as &quot;the ombudsman&quot;); and


<br>
&quot;relevant complaint&quot; means a complaint against an estate agent which&#151; 


<br>
(a)   is made by a person who at the material time is the seller or a potential buyer of a residential property; and


<br>
(b)   relates to an act or omission affecting the complainant in the course of the estate agent&#039;s activities in relation to a home information pack that is (or will be) required for that property (including the giving of advice as to whether such a pack is required).


<br>
(7)   For the purposes of the law relating to defamation, proceedings under an approved redress scheme in relation to the investigation and determination of a complaint which is subject to an order under this section are to be treated in the same way as proceedings before a court.&quot;


<br>
After Clause 151, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
   &quot;APPROVAL OF REDRESS SCHEMES


<br>
(1)   If the Secretary of State considers that a redress scheme (including one made by him or in pursuance of arrangements made by him) is satisfactory for the purposes of section (Power to require estate agents to belong to a redress scheme), he may approve it for those purposes.


<br>
(2)   In determining whether a redress scheme is satisfactory the Secretary of State shall have regard to&#151;


<br>
(a)   the provisions of the scheme;


<br>
(b)   the manner in which the scheme will be operated (so far as can be judged from the facts known to him); and


<br>
(c)   the respective interests of members of the scheme and of sellers and potential buyers of residential properties.


<br>
(3)   A redress scheme may not be approved unless it makes satisfactory provision about the following matters (among other things)&#151;


<br>
(a)   the matters about which complaints may be made (which may include non-compliance with the provisions of a code of practice or other document);
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1325"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1325</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(b)   the ombudsman&#039;s duties and powers in relation to the investigation and determination of complaints (which may include power to decide not to investigate or determine a complaint); 

<br>
(c)   the provision of information by the ombudsman to&#151;


<br>
(i)   persons exercising functions under other schemes providing a means of redress for consumers; and


<br>
(ii)   the Secretary of State or any other person exercising regulatory functions in relation to the activities of estate agents.


<br>
(4)   An application for approval of a redress scheme shall be made in such manner as the Secretary of State may determine, accompanied by such information as the Secretary of State may require.


<br>
(5)   The person administering an approved redress scheme shall notify the Secretary of State of any change to the scheme as soon as practicable after the change is made.&quot;


<br>
After Clause 151, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
   &quot;WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVAL


<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State may withdraw his approval of a redress scheme. 


<br>
(2)   But before withdrawing his approval, the Secretary of State shall serve on the person administering the scheme a notice stating&#151;


<br>
(a)   that he proposes to withdraw his approval;


<br>
(b)   the grounds for the proposed withdrawal of approval; and


<br>
(c)   that representations about the proposed withdrawal may be made within such period of not less than 14 days as is specified in the notice.

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="40916-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I think I am right now. Again, I apologise. We are now obviously on the right to buy scheme.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Let me begin by saying that we on these Benches in no way condone those who systematically and cynically abuse the right to buy scheme. It is indeed right and proper that measures be introduced to deal with it. We additionally welcome those new provisions that deal with the scam whereby people immediately want to buy their homes when a demolition order is put in place.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Although the Government have been rather late converts to the principle of right to buy, it is worth remembering that is has enabled individuals and families, for the first time in many cases, to take the opportunity to own their own homes. That is an important principle and one that we should safeguard at all costs. We are, in effect, probing the Government as to why they feel extending the qualifying period is a necessary step forward. The Government are wrong to think that by increasing the qualifying period, and reducing the available discount, they will suddenly safeguard the number of available social houses.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The Minister will be aware that fewer social houses are being built by a combination of local authorities and registered social landlords than at any time for more than a decade. Kate Barker states in her report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;In 2001, around 175,000 dwellings were built in the UK&#151;the lowest level since the Second World War.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40916-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>That is the real reason for the lack of affordable housing. Indeed, this understanding is backed up by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which suggests that the impact of the right to buy on the availability of social housing has been patchy and insignificant. So the argument that the real problem with the availability of social housing is the right to buy seems not to be supported by lenders, based on survey evidence.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We are rather less enthusiastic about the provisions for reducing discount in the south-east. It is now becoming very difficult indeed to acquire a house in London, even with the discount that the Government currently apply. People used to apply for a discount under the right to buy in order to put down a deposit on their mortgage. Because the price of London houses is now so high, it is very difficult for anyone to use the right to buy provisions accordingly. Furthermore, the scheme has now been running for some time. What evidence, therefore, has the Minister&#039;s department collected that such a scheme is indeed tackling abuse?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1327"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1327</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>My Lords, although we welcome the Government&#039;s attempt to crack down on abuses in the right to buy scheme, we are less than convinced that cracking down on the scheme itself, as the Government intend to do in Clause 157, is the most appropriate way forward. The failings are not in the scheme itself, but in the Government&#039;s woeful attempts at building enough social housing and&#151;I stress before the Minister corrects me&#151;starving local authorities of sufficient finance to do so. Indeed the Government&#039;s record on social housing is not one that any administration should be proud of.

<a name="40916-08_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I thank the Deputy Chairman of Committees for that explanation. I was slightly confused because there is an amendment with the debate on clause stand part, which is why I thought somebody might be saying something about it.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I should like to say a few words about right to buy. I could say a lot more but, because we want to get through business today, I will be fairly brief. We on these Benches broadly welcome the changes the Government have brought to the scheme. There are particular areas we welcome. There have been considerable difficulties in areas where demolition is planned and people have been able to get discounts and buy up houses. Obviously, it is a sensible move in that connection. Extending the length of time that people have to be residents to get their discounts, and the time for pay back and so on, is important.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>We on these Benches have always thought that if we are going to give the right to buy to tenants, it should be a local decision of the local council. I would welcome it if the Government, in moving towards giving local councils more discretion over many areas, would think about this. The people who know best about the housing situation in their area, and the people who draw up their housing strategies, are the local councils. That is what we have always said about right to buy, and what we would like to see.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Having said that, my experience of right to buy in two very different areas throws up different problems. For many years I was a councillor in Southampton, and we had a lot of council properties. Over the years, the properties that we lost were family homes. That meant that we had great difficulty housing people with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1328"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1328</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children; they ended up going into blocks of flats. The whole problem with the scheme is that one cannot replace the houses that one has sold.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Then there were other problems. In the area of the university, people would buy their homes at a discount and then sell to other people who wanted to rent them to students. There was a lot of building going on around Southampton, and once people had bought their houses they did not want to live on the council estates any more. They often bought houses of much lower quality than the council home that they had bought. Then we would see a whole street decline as it was let out to students. I am not damning students, but we all know that their interest is not in the garden and what the house looks like at the front.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>One of the aims of right to buy, however, was to make areas much more diverse in terms of community. Where I live now in Berwick-upon-Tweed, that certainly happened. One reason for that was that no houses were built outside the estate for people to move off it to. The point of the scheme was to help people to own their own homes if they wanted to, but the expense was that those people wanting to rent homes did not have the same variety as before.

</p>

<a name="40916-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>In recent times, we have seen efforts by the Government to bring social housing up to their so-called decent homes standard. There has been a boom in right to buy, and some of the cash for decent homes has been eaten up in that area. There has been considerable concern about that. Over the years, a huge amount has been involved in right to buy. I saw a headline somewhere that said that right-to-buy sales could plug the decent homes gap 10 times over. We still have problems, but I welcome the efforts of the Government to try to make sure that we are genuinely helping people to own their own homes, not helping other people to make lots of money and others to come in and change whole areas. That was not the point of the scheme when it started, and it is important that we address that.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>As the debate continues, I hope that we may be able to deal with some of the other issues that surround right to buy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40916-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Clause 157 amends Section 119 of the Housing Act 1985 to extend from two years to five years the period which tenants must spend qualifying for the right-to-buy scheme. The two-year period is too short. Tenants can count any period of tenancy with a wide range of public bodies, no matter how long ago, towards qualifying for right to buy. That means that many tenants who have previously spent time as public sector tenants qualify for right to buy as soon as they move into their council homes. Extending the period to five years will encourage tenants to make a longer-term commitment to the community before they can buy. That picks up one of the issues raised by the noble Baroness. It is worth remembering that, when right to buy was introduced in 1980, the qualification period was set at three years and subsequently reduced.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>We want to stress two other matters. First, Clause 157 also amends Section 129 of the Housing Act 1985 to ensure that tenants will be eligible for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1329"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1329</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

same level of discount after qualifying for five years as they are after five years under the current rules. They will be entitled to 35 per cent on a house, or 50 per cent on a flat, subject of course to the overriding limit on discount for the area in which they live. Secondly, Clause 157 will apply only to tenants who take up wholly new tenancies that begin on or after the day on which it comes into effect. That means that existing secure and public sector tenants will not be affected, provided that they remain as public sector tenants continuously up until the time at which they exercise their right to buy. We did not consider it fair to move the goalposts for existing tenants.
</p>

<a name="40916-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Clause 157 attracted the support of the Home Ownership Task Force, which was asked to identify the scope for better targeting and design of government schemes to help those in housing need to meet their home ownership aspirations. It is intended to foster future tenants&#039; sense of commitment to the area in which they live. It is an important measure that makes some sensible and practical adjustments, and it should deal with some of the abuses that even the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, fully acknowledged exist with the current scheme. It also brings some balance back to right to buy, which we fully support; I heard what he said about opposing right to buy in the early years, but all parties now see its benefits. We have to ensure that it works well and does not provide scope for rip-offs. No one can support that form of exploitation at the expense of the public purse. I hope that the noble Lord will no longer object to the clause.

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40916-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie </b>   moved Amendment No. 211:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>After Clause 157, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_8"></a><br>
   &quot;EXCEPTIONS TO RIGHT TO BUY: RURAL AREAS

<br>
   The National Authority may by order designate rural areas as exempt from the right to buy scheme.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_101"></a>The noble Lord said: The aim of this proposed provision is to exclude the right to buy in certain rural areas&#151;the smaller places where there are populations of 3,000 and under. That would make the right-to-buy restriction in line with the right-to-acquire scheme for other social housing landlords. The purpose is pretty straightforward; it is to preserve an adequate supply of affordable rented housing for local people in rural areas.

</p>

<a name="40916-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The right to acquire and the right to buy are two very similar schemes, the former available to tenants in properties owned by registered social landlords and the latter to tenants of local-authority-owned properties. Currently, there is significant disparity in the application of the schemes in relation to properties in rural areas. The right to acquire is not available now to tenants in designated small rural settlements&#151;those with a population of 3,000 or under. The reason for that is to preserve the supply of affordable rented housing for local people. That justification applies equally to local-authority-owned properties in similar locations, and the right-to-buy scheme should be changed to mirror that element of the right-to-acquire scheme.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1330"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1330</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The difficulties of replacing properties through right to buy in rural areas are commonly accepted. First, there is the price of housing in rural areas, which is often exacerbated by the purchase of second homes by better-off people. Secondly, the availability of land severely limits the scope for newly built housing, and the potential to buy on the open market is limited due to the overall size of local housing markets. That is made more acute by the removal of local authority social housing grant. Securing an ongoing supply of social housing for rural communities is surely essential to achieving sustainable communities. My proposed change to the right-to-buy scheme seeks to realise sustainable communities by ensuring an ongoing supply of social housing for future generations in rural areas.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I have been assisted by the Local Government Association on the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40916-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Amendment No. 212 is grouped with the amendment. It is aimed in a somewhat similar direction, but I am bound to say that I do not find myself in sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord. I do not see why particular sectors of the rural community should be excluded from right to buy, as available to the rest of the country. It is not as though the shortage of suitable social housing exists exclusively in rural areas. It exists in most urban areas in the country. This great city of London&#151;if I could include that in the wider sense of the word &quot;great&quot;&#151;probably has the most acute form of that problem: we see that with essential workers completely unable to get suitable housing. But the right to buy exists here and, as the Minister has indicated, there is general agreement that the right to buy has been beneficial. A discriminatory amendment of the sort that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has surprised me with&#151;he is generally very broad-minded about such issues&#151;would not be helpful.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="40916-09_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>My noble friend Lord Hanningfield on the Front Bench has identified the source of the problem, which is the static building rate that applies nationally and appears in an acute form in many rural communities and particularly the smaller communities. There are a number of reasons for that, which I will not go into now because it would take too long. I am under some time pressure and I want to get to the end of the debate.

</p>

<a name="40916-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Amendment No. 212 is addressed to a different issue. It looks as though for the coming decade the major source of new social housing will be as part of a great swathe of new development required across the country. We have seen various figures as to what the proportion of social housing should be where major development takes place. Indeed the Minister&#039;s honourable friend&#151;at least I assume he is an honourable friend since he is now back in the Labour Party&#151;the Mayor of London would like to see that figure as high as 50 per cent.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The fact is that those houses are not free. They have to be paid for, and they are paid for by one of three groups of people&#151;or possibly a fourth. I declare a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1331"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1331</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

retrospective interest in the subject, having once been involved in Section 106 negotiation, so I have some feeling in the matter. In such developments, social housing will be paid for either by the original owners of the site, or by the developer, or&#151;this is where it starts to become dangerous if the proportion goes too high&#151;in the end by the purchasers of the final properties on the rest of the site. The cost of the social housing is borne in different proportions by those three groups of people.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>There is indirectly a fourth participant in that equation&#151;the Treasury has an interest because the cost of those social houses comes off the profitability of a new development and therefore reduces the Exchequer&#039;s take in gains taxes. The Treasury is in a sense a participant as well. That equation can and does produce a large volume of social housing. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s considerable ambitions to increase the building rate is a matter with which I have some sympathy. However, the purpose of building social housing&#151;which is paid for largely by individuals&#151;is defeated if the right to buy can apply straight away once the houses become social houses&#151;when they are transferred to the people. When we were making our Section 106 agreement, the biggest obstacle we had to overcome was the right to buy. There are ways round it, but it would be much more sensible, if it were clearly stated that there was a period of time during which social housing provided in that way should not have the right to buy applied to it.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Amendment No. 212 is a probing amendment. Nothing would please me more than if the Minister could demonstrate to me that it is completely unnecessary. If he can do that, I should be exceedingly happy and shall leave the Chamber in great glee. One should not have to go through all sorts of legal procedures and devices, as we had to, in order to ensure that where social benefit is provided to the community it remains as a social benefit to the community for a reasonable period of time. One can argue about the length of time. I have suggested 25 years in the amendment because I think for ever is too long and is not appropriate. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40916-09_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, tabled his amendment to enable us to have this debate, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that rural areas should not suffer an absolute blanket exemption from the right to buy.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The statement made about a previous amendment by my noble friend Lady Maddock was absolutely right. The right people to make the decision about this matter are local authorities. They are charged with producing a housing needs document. They are also best placed to make a judgment about this matter. The blanket designation of settlement by size&#151;whether they should be in or out of the right to buy&#151;has not proved wildly successful either. The size of the population does not provide any measure for how <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1332"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1332</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much social housing it has or not, or what the pressure on that social housing is. These are all issues that come up in the housing needs assessment.

</p>

<a name="40916-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Further than that, there are another couple of reasons why we would not want to designate rural areas in this blanket way, which was alluded to by my noble friend Lady Maddock. When one denies a group of people the right to buy their house, that section of the rural community will become less diverse, because it will be less attractive to those who are able to buy their own home. The likelihood is that that section of social housing will continue to be occupied by those who are unable to afford to buy. It will&#151;I have seen it happen time and again&#151;enter into a spiral of decline and become a real challenge to the local authority. If the Government are aiming for diversity of community, they should resist ghettoising&#151;if I might use the word&#151;sections of housing and particularly just choosing it by geographical area.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I was quite surprised by the short memory&#151;if I may say so&#151;of the Conservative Bench because the problem with the right to buy, especially in rural areas, began with the fact that local authorities never had the right to replace the housing stock by using the capital receipts from that housing. In little villages which had 6, 10 or 20 houses, that inability proved fatal to the villages&#151;not only in terms of social housing, but in terms of the post office and the pub, whose customers naturally fell off as the younger people had to move into the towns. It is still something I feel deeply about.

</p>

<a name="40916-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I see the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, shaking her head, but I can tell her that when I was leader of South Somerset District Council that was exactly what happened. I declare an interest as a Somerset county councillor. We are part of our local strategic partnership, and we are deciding how to spend the moneys from the extra second homes tax at the moment. I hope that county councils will make a decision to devolve that money to local strategic partnerships, which will then decide to put it into affordable housing.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The Minister may be aware that the rural commission of the Local Government Association met in Bath on Tuesday of this week. It passed an emergency motion regarding affordable housing in rural areas and the desperate situation that exists. If the Minister has not yet seen that motion I hope that he will take time to look at it. The point of interest beyond the words of that motion was that it was passed unanimously&#151;with everyone from every party supporting it. That says something regarding the depth of feeling in rural areas.
</p>

<a name="40916-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The key is issue is making sure that rural areas have the money to spend on social housing. It is key to retaining jobs, as the Minister knows. Finally, I should like to comment on exception sites. Perhaps it was the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who mentioned that land was expensive, and, of course, it is. But extremely good use has been made of exception sites&#151;that is where housing may be released and developed for social housing use only, never for private housing. It has been used successfully by bodies such as the Rural Housing Trust, to whose work I shall return in a later <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1333"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1333</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment. I hope that the Government will continue to encourage the use of exception sites and perhaps even to think how they may be encouraged more extensively through an amendment to the Bill. That is not something that I have thought of doing myself, but I might be interested to come back to that later.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40916-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I shall not detain the Committee for long but I feel passionately about this issue. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has moved the amendment and that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has tabled Amendment No. 212.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>If you have ever been confronted as a younger person, as I was once, with two children, a wife and family, not to be able to afford to compete with second home owners in your own community is really the end. I had an extremely bleak experience. There was no social housing anyway, because that had dried up. This is an important amendment. The pleas made for local authorities to be in the driving seat regarding these policies are important, because, as has been said, housing needs are assessed by them.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>However, there is a famine of social rented housing in the countryside and young people cannot compete in the private market at all. One of the problems is that builders are building executive homes in villages and in comparison with the low wage economies in rural areas buying a home is cloud cuckoo land for young people. They cannot even look at those homes. Social exclusion is happening to young people from rural areas. This distorts community life; schools do not have so many children in them and eventually close down in many cases; older people dominate&#151;there is nothing wrong with that&#151;but to such an extent that there are not equal numbers of people of different ages in the community. GP practices are overrun in some places and social problems result.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Commuters dominate in other places and second home owners in others. Often all occur in the same place. This problem has to be overcome. It results in few jobs for young people in rural areas and the local economy often dries up because people are spending money elsewhere, not in their local community. It is vital that this problem is overcome in the most practical ways possible. Indeed it should be in the forefront of ensuring that young people can actually live in their own communities.
<a name="time_8"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="40916-10_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I have much sympathy with the sentiments behind the amendment, but for the reasons that my noble friend has given, we may not be solving the problem that we are trying to tackle. Problems of affordable housing in rural areas are well documented and I was surprised that in speaking to his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, seemed to think that the problems were just the same as in the city. Perhaps I could read him a few figures&#151;86 per cent of rural housing is owner occupied or privately rented, whereas it is about 77 per cent in urban areas. In rural areas the social rented sector is only 13.4 per cent of total housing, compared with 22.4 per cent in urban areas. We also know that in 2002&#150;03 house prices rose <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1334"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1334</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

faster in rural areas than in towns. That shows us the scale of the problem, but the question is how we tackle it.

</p>

<a name="40916-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>As I said earlier, this should not be a blanket scheme; it should be up to local authorities to make their own decisions. In recent years the Government have moved towards giving power to local authorities and if Ministers wish to help, this would be one area in which that would be useful. The key to this is affordability. Trying to find ways of keeping affordable the houses that come in through social money is difficult. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, talked of his own experience and trying to find legal ways of doing such things is difficult.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>However, there are schemes up and running. I understand that there is a scheme in Shropshire called the golden share scheme. Under it, the equity that has built up by having social money in affordable housing remains there and the houses remain affordable, whether one is buying or renting; so that when rented social housing is lost, at least it does not become a very high-priced second home. We on these Benches are looking at how we can put this into some national policy. But there are schemes working and I know that government departments know about the scheme in Shropshire. It is not an easy issue to tackle.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>For the reasons that I have outlined, although we understand the sentiments behind the amendment and what it is trying to achieve, it will solve some problems but re-create others. We do not support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40916-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   This has been a valuable 20 minutes. As a government spokesman I cannot accept the amendment, but I recognise the importance, validity and the urgency of the debate. In particular, I was struck by the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I have often pondered the problem myself. I grew up in a village and my mother was a council tenant. The stock of social housing in that village has shrunk as a product of right-to-buy and many of the friends with whom I grew up exercised their right, quite understandably. Sadly, in that part of Essex social and affordable housing in the rural communities has not been replaced.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Our Government have made and renewed their commitment to ensuring that there is social housing in rural communities. For the first time in a generation the numbers of social housing units built in rural communities has begun to increase. We recognise that there is more to do in this field and the rural White Paper underlined our commitment to ensuring that more of the existing housing in rural areas is available to local people. That was the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, touched on with her heartfelt plea. It is an important issue. Many of my friends were forced to move away from the village because they could not rent and the available and emerging estates of new homes were there only for sale. They were beyond those ordinary working folk&#039;s pockets.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Under Section 157 of the Housing Act 1985 landlords in certain specified areas may place restrictions on the resale of homes sold under the right-to-buy scheme. Landlords can choose between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1335"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1335</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

requiring owners for at least three years to resell only to people who have lived or worked locally or, if landlords prefer, for the 10 years following initial purchase require that owners first offer the property back to the former landlord before selling it on the open market.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, will be aware that similar restrictions are in place in the seven national parks, in the 37 areas of outstanding natural beauty and in 30 areas designated as rural for this purpose by the Secretary of State. Together, these cover about 40 per cent of the land area of England. Clause 165 extends a right of first refusal to all other right-to-buy landlords wherever they are, but it explicitly retains the current system in national parks, AONBs and designated rural areas.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Similar amendments to the one tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, were debated on Report in another place, as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said at the time:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;We recognise that there are pressures on affordable housing in many rural areas.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 11/5/04; col. 252.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>However, exempting rural areas from the right to buy would, I think most contributors to this debate have said, unfairly discriminate against those who wanted to become home owners in those areas.

</p>

<a name="40916-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>It would be too inflexible and very sweeping for all tenants who happen to live in rural areas to be denied the chance of home ownership. The existing restrictions on reselling, which recycle former right-to-buy homes to local people and are already in place in a significant part of the country, are sufficient. Tenants can choose to buy or to continue to rent, while landlords can choose to impose one or other of the two resale restrictions, or not to include any restriction.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I know that the Home Ownership Task Force considered the difference between the right-to-buy and right-to-acquire schemes in this respect. But it did not call for immediate change. It recommended that the rural restrictions for both schemes should be retained, with a view to alignment in the longer term. In response, we have said that we are committed to retaining the existing rural restrictions in both schemes, and that we do not plan to align them.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>A balance is needed here between respecting the quite proper aspirations of social tenants in rural areas to become home owners and the need to retain social housing for local people. Those who raised the issue in another place suggested that if the Government do not wish to restrict the availability of the right to buy in rural areas they might instead consider lowering the maximum discounts available to tenants in those areas. We have already done this in 41 areas in London and the south-east that are under the greatest housing pressure.

</p>

<a name="40916-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The Minister for Housing responded by saying that we recognise that housing pressures may be driving up house prices in some rural areas and that, although we have no intention of introducing across-the-board <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1336"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1336</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

restrictions, we will continue to monitor the situation. I can confirm that we will keep the position on maximum discounts under review. We believe that this more flexible approach is preferable to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I turn to the second amendment, which, in our view, is unnecessary. Most new social housing for rent, whether provided under a Section 106 agreement or on rural exception sites, is provided by registered social landlords. The right-to-buy scheme does not apply to assured tenants of registered social landlords, so it is unlikely that tenants living in new properties built under Section 106 agreements or on rural exception sites would be eligible for the right-to-buy scheme.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>As is commonly understood, the right to buy is only available to secure tenants of local authorities, and to pre-1988 secure tenants of non-charitable housing associations. Former local authority tenants of housing stock which has been transferred retain a preserved right to buy.

</p>

<a name="40916-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Both the rural exceptions policy and Section 106 agreements can be used to secure the provision of new-build affordable housing. Affordable housing ranges from social rented housing generally provided by registered social landlords to low-cost home ownership schemes, such as shared ownership and housing for sub-market sale.
</p>

<a name="40916-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The rural exceptions policy allows local planning authorities to grant permission for housing development within and adjoining villages, which the local plan would not otherwise release for housing, in order to provide affordable housing to meet local needs in perpetuity.

</p>

<a name="40916-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Section 106 agreements are those between local authorities and developers. They are usually negotiated when planning permission is granted in respect of the use of land being developed. Planning obligations can be used to secure contributions from developers towards the provision of necessary infrastructure associated with the development, and the provision of affordable housing to meet identified needs based on up-to-date housing assessments.

From personal experience, going round the country and as leader of a local authority with rural communities remote to our major settlement, I can see that this is not an issue that will go away or one that can be left. We are addressing it through current policies.

</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments relates to the aim of the demolition notice provisions and is designed to address loopholes in existing legislation. Currently, when tenants know that demolition is likely, they are able to buy at a discount knowing that when the property has to be repurchased using compulsory powers they will be entitled to full market value plus home loss compensation. This adversely affects the financial viability of regeneration schemes.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>In another place it was suggested that our original proposals did not deal adequately with regeneration schemes involving the phased demolition of blocks or areas over several years. Tenants in such areas are likely to be aware of demolition plans well in advance and may be tempted to exploit the rules. Stakeholders have also suggested that the existing clauses did not adequately address situations where landlords had compulsorily to purchase from local owner-occupiers, a process that, as most of us will have experienced or observed, may be subject to delays.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We thought that there was force in those points and we have therefore decided to amend the procedure for demolition notices. There will now be a two-stage process. First, initial demolition notices&#151;IDNs&#151;will suspend a landlord&#039;s obligation to complete a right-to-buy purchase. Secondly, final demolition notices&#151;FDNs&#151;will terminate any right-to-buy claims and <br>&nbsp;<br>

prevent any new ones being made. In both cases there will be a prescribed notification procedure that landlords must follow. Notices must set out the reasons for demolition and the effect of the notice served. Landlords must also publicise them locally, both in the local press and on the landlord&#039;s website&#151;my notes say &quot;if he has one&quot;; I suppose that most landlords probably now do. But that is an obligation on them.
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="40916-11_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The initial demolition notices are not capable of extension, although the final demolition notices may be extended on application to the Secretary of State. Either notice can be revoked by the Secretary of State if he takes the view that the landlord has no intention of demolishing the properties.

</p>

<a name="40916-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>We therefore propose, first, that an initial demolition notice, valid for no longer than five years and not extendable, may be served, and that will suspend the landlord&#039;s obligation to complete the right-to-buy sale. It will not prevent new right-to-buy applications being made but it will provide a breathing space in which landlords can properly develop schemes and, where necessary, follow the statutory compulsory purchase procedures. Tenants&#039; interests are protected. Right-to-buy claims can continue to be made and will be processed as normal so that if a demolition plan fails to proceed, the application can then be completed.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Secondly, final demolition notices can be served. These should be valid for two years rather than 18 months. Final demolition notices will end any existing right-to-buy claims and prevent any new ones being lodged.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>A landlord will be able to serve a final notice only if there are no owner-occupiers within the planned demolition area and acquisition of those properties is essential for the demolition plans to proceed, or if there are such properties but binding agreements for the acquisition of the properties have been agreed and/or compulsory purchase orders have been successfully made and the landlord has served notices to treat or has made a vesting declaration in respect of all the owner-occupied properties within the planned demolition area.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>That proviso is important. It would be unfair to bring right-to-buy claims to an end and prevent new ones being made in cases where a regeneration scheme, and hence the need for demolition, depended upon the purchase of local owner-occupied properties which may never take place. So, if a CPO is necessary in order for demolition plans to go ahead and the CPO is not confirmed or is quashed by the courts, an IND will cease to have effect.
</p>

<a name="40916-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>For tenants who have made a valid right-to-buy claim, and an initial demolition notice or a final demolition notice is served before the transaction is completed, compensation will be available for conveyancing-related expenses incurred before the respective notice was served.

(a)   a secure tenant has claimed to exercise the right to buy, but


<br>
(b)   before the landlord has made to the tenant such a grant as is required by section 138(1) in respect of the claim, a final demolition notice is served on the tenant under paragraph 13 of Schedule 5.

(2)   In such a case&#151; 


<br>
(a)   the tenant&#039;s claim ceases to be effective as from the time when the final demolition notice comes into force under that paragraph, and

(a)   a secure tenant has claimed to exercise the right to buy,


<br>
(b)   before the landlord has made to the tenant such a grant as is required by section 138(1) in respect of the claim, either an initial demolition notice is served on the tenant under Schedule 5A or a final demolition notice is served on him under paragraph 13 of Schedule 5, and


<br>
(c)   the tenant&#039;s claim is established before that notice comes into force under Schedule 5A or paragraph 13 of Schedule 5 (as the case may be).


<br>
(2)   If, within the period of three months beginning with the date when the notice comes into force (&quot;the operative date&quot;), the tenant serves on the landlord a written notice claiming an amount of compensation under subsection (3), the landlord shall pay that amount to the tenant.


<br>
(3)   Compensation under this subsection is compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by the tenant before the operative date in respect of legal and other fees, and other professional costs and expenses, payable in connection with the exercise by him of the right to buy.


<br>
(4)   A notice under subsection (2) must be accompanied by receipts or other documents showing that the tenant incurred the expenditure in question.&quot;

(3)   After Schedule 5 to the Act insert, as Schedule 5A, the Schedule set out in Schedule (New Schedule 5A to the Housing Act 1985: initial demolition notices) to this Act.


<br>
(4)   The amendments made by this section do not apply in any case where the tenant&#039;s notice under section 122 of the Act (notice claim to exercise right to buy) was served before the day on which this section comes into force.&quot; </p>

relation to a local authority, an RSL or a housing trust. They are essentially probing in their nature and are designed to raise a number of concerns that we on these Benches have received in relation to this measure.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I believe that the ODPM recently conducted a consultation exercise on the right of first refusal. Therefore, I am sure that the concerns that I shall raise today will be familiar to the Minister, given that they were expressed during the consultation.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>In short, we are not convinced that this proposal will address the Government&#039;s stated aim of increasing the amount of affordable housing provision. We believe that it would be a waste of resources to purchase units which did not meet the specific housing needs of the local authority or RSL in question.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>A fundamental problem is the lack of identified additional funding for buying back units; nor will the additional cost of the procedure be compensated by additional central government funding. The cost of buying back units at current market prices is not more efficient than developing new units. Social housing providers are especially concerned that resources will be expended in notifying other landlords to little or no benefit in terms of additional social housing.

</p>

<a name="40916-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Local authorities will incur substantial costs in administering the scheme, especially given the heavily prescribed procedure. The estimate is that, in implementing this procedure, each local authority would have to employ three extra staff, not to mention the additional costs of accommodation and overheads.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>It is not clear that compensation for time lost due to dispute over valuation is built into the process. All the deadlines seem very tight, given the prescribed arrangements and the lack of recognition of delaying factors. There is nothing to stop a landlord who does not accept purchase failing to notify a further appropriate body. A landlord has not only to notify a further authority but to establish that a nomination would be accepted and then issue a notice within the period. In the case of a freeholder selling, it appears that further authorities that are notified have only two weeks in which to consider accepting purchase.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>This proposal will not affect current resales which are not covered by the covenant and it offers no prospect for increasing social housing at present. Perhaps a better way forward would be a voluntary scheme, with funding, which allowed the local authority to buy back units that were in short supply. Social housing providers do not wish to be forced into a scheme which would, essentially, expend resources on administration and create additional bureaucracy. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40916-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Clauses 165, 174, 177 and 181 give local authorities, registered social landlords and housing action trusts which have sold properties at a discount, either under the right-to-buy scheme or through voluntary disposals, a right of first refusal. That means that the owner of a property sold by a social housing landlord who wishes to resell it within 10 years of the sale must first offer it back to the landlord or to another prescribed person.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Having consulted on the proposed procedures and bodies to be prescribed, the Secretary of State will prescribe in regulations a time limit within which such offers must be accepted. If they are not accepted within that time limit, the owner will be free to resell on the open market. The property will be offered at market value. That will be the value agreed between the parties or, if for some reason they are unable to agree, that determined by the district valuer.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would make it discretionary, rather than mandatory, for landlords to insert the right of first refusal covenant. While that may appear to be a reasonable proposition, it would have the effect of weakening the right of first refusal. If it is not made mandatory, the opportunity to buy back properties may be lost when circumstances and housing need change in a local area. Also, the effect of a landlord not including the right of first refusal covenant is to deprive other social landlords in the area of the chance of being nominated to buy back the property.
</p>

<a name="40916-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The responses to the consultation showed overwhelming support from stakeholders for the principle of the right of first refusal. There is very little support for it to be made discretionary.

connected properties to another body. The Secretary of State will be able to prescribe the time limits within which such offers should be accepted and the circumstances in which the right of first refusal will lapse. He will protect the interests of prospective sellers on which he has consulted.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The aim of the right of first refusal is to provide a means whereby property that is sold under a right-to-buy scheme can revert to the social housing sector without imposing an undue burden on the prospective seller. The amendment is designed to ensure that the right of first refusal is not overlooked.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The right of first refusal will be imposed in all cases where there is a right-to-buy sale, apart from in rural areas, which I shall deal with later. However, the position is different in respect of voluntary disposals. Those can take place only with consent. General consents have been issued by the Secretary of State in relation to disposals by local authorities and indeed by the Housing Corporation in relation to disposals by social landlords, but not by the Secretary of State in relation to housing action trusts because voluntary disposals are very rare in that context.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Generally, it is the case that voluntary disposals should not be on terms that are more generous than right to buy, as that could enable evasion of the right-to-buy scheme. I should also stress that we do not intend that general consents will allow for the exclusion of right of first refusal. As a matter of practice, the right of first refusal will be included in the vast majority of voluntary disposals.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>In national parks and in other designated rural areas, it is intended that general consents will allow landlords to choose between a right of first refusal and a restriction requiring sales to be made only to local people. That is intended to preserve existing choice, where restriction is more appropriate for landlords in rural areas. That will not, of course, be the case with housing action trusts which operated only in urban areas.

<a name="40916-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the enforceability of a right of first refusal covenant, where one is imposed, by changing the enforcement provisions so that they are in line with the provisions of the Land Registration Act 2002. I beg to move.

   &quot;MARKETING PLAN FOR RIGHT TO BUY SALES

<br>
(1)   To monitor sales resulting from right to buy, local authorities will be required to formulate and publish publicly a yearly marketing plan for right to buy sales.


<br>
(2)   The marketing plan will include&#151;


<br>
(a)   figures on the number of properties sold through the right to buy scheme in the last 12 months,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1345"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1345</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(b)   a target figure for the number of properties to be sold through the right to buy scheme in the coming 12 months, and

<br>
(c)   plans for how to achieve the target figure under paragraph (b).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_124"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 212ABA would introduce a marketing plan for local authorities in regard to the number of right to buy sales within their area. The clause was discussed at some length in the other place. However, by putting it before this Committee, I hope that the Government will have had a change of heart and will look more favourably on its merits.

</p>

<a name="40916-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Consistent with the spirit and intention of the original right-to-buy legislation, it is important that we simultaneously put proper demands on local authorities that may not be carrying out their proper obligations in respect of the right to buy as enthusiastically as they might. It is clear from a study of local authorities across the country that some drive the right to buy with enthusiasm while others are reticent in encouraging people to take it up. That can involve the speed with which they deal with inquiries, how they market their local policy and how they value their properties.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The plan would include targets on the number of properties that the authority planned to sell and how many it had sold, as well as how it would achieve that target. That seems to me a sensible, constructive and measured way to encourage local authorities to think creatively about how to deal with the right to buy. Few local authorities would think that it could not be taken on board at small cost. It would not be a massive exercise because good local authorities are doing much of that work already. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="40916-13_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   This is a request for more red tape and burdens on local authorities. It is also worth pointing out that the way in which the amendment is drafted excludes more than 800,000 housing association tenants who have the right to buy following stock transfer from local authorities. If it is thought that there should be marketing for the rest of the local authority tenants, I do not see why those 800,000 are missed out.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>On the other hand, we do not agree with it anyway. By its nature, the right-to-buy scheme is demand led. Tenants have a legal right. Notwithstanding what was said earlier, the Labour Party may have come late, but it was 1986 when we changed our policy on that. The snag is that we forgot to tell anyone at the ensuing general election. I know that because I was the shadow housing spokesman.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>In 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01, more than 90,000 tenants applied for the right to buy and were accepted. In 2001&#150;02 the number rose to 102,000; in 2002&#150;03 it was more than 149,000; and the figure fell back to 110,000 in 2003&#150;04. The number of completed sales has increased from about 40,000 a year some seven years ago to between 52,000 and 54,000 in the next <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1346"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1346</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

three years, 63,000 in 2002&#150;03 and almost 70,000 in 2003&#150;04. Given those facts, it is somewhat surprising that the right to buy scheme needs to be marketed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="40916-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We were not suggesting that local authorities should have a marketing plan.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>The noble Lord said: While, on the whole, we can lend our support to Clause 166 which deals with the provision of information to tenants, Amendments Nos. 212AC and 212AD are simply designed to aid and to clarify the process a little further.
</p>

<a name="40916-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>As the Bill presently stands, it is up to the Secretary of State to decide when information regarding right to buy should be provided to tenants. It appears to be a degree of centralisation that is one step too far. Surely, it should at least be left to the relevant local authority in question. Additionally, it would appear sensible that a tenant, on completion of a tenancy agreement, be provided with such information as is the intent of Amendment No. 212AD. Furthermore, Amendment No. 212AC would ensure that there is a one-off delivery of such information to existing tenants. That would appear to be a sensible and rational way forward and one that I would hope that the Minister could support. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Clause 166 supplements the existing duty placed on landlords by Section 104 of the Housing Act 1985 to provide information about the terms of their secure tenancies and the landlords&#039; repair obligations. It also replaces the duty to provide information in respect of right to buy. Clause 166 requires landlords also to supply information to tenants on the responsibilities and consequences of being a home owner. The aim is to help them to decide whether to exercise their right to buy. The Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales have consulted separately on what information should be provided, and when. The vast majority of respondents supported the proposals.
</p>

<a name="40916-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>In consulting stakeholders, we stated that we envisaged, as soon as reasonably practical after Clause 166 comes into effect, getting landlords to provide the specified information to all new secure tenants as soon as they take up the tenancy and once every five years thereafter, or after any substantial changes are made to the right to buy scheme, the home buying and selling process, or the regime for service charges payable by leaseholders.

<a name="40916-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I have an extensive note. It says: &quot;Why?&quot;. The clause deletes provisions on rent-to-mortgage.

Rent-to-mortgage enables tenants to buy a share in their houses if they cannot afford to buy them outright under the right to buy. The effect would be to leave on the statute book a scheme that has seen very little take-up since it was launched 10 years ago&#151;and is expensive to administer&#151;as well as thwarting the Government&#039;s policy of streamlining the number of low-cost home ownership schemes, a key recommendation of the Home Ownership Task Force.

(a)   that the landlord of the non-secure tenant is a fully mutual housing association registered with the Housing Corporation or Housing for Wales;

</p>

<a name="40916-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The amendment concerns the outcome of operating the right to buy, and the rights of tenants to transfer. It gives secure tenants of local authorities the right to engage with co-operative tenants and preserves the right of co-ops to decide whether to give an equivalent right to exchange in their tenancy agreements. CDS Co-operatives considers this to be good practice, and their model tenancy agreement includes a right to exchange, subject to the incoming tenant being willing to accept the responsibility of being a member of the co-op&#151;in other words, they accept that they share the democratic responsibilities for the decisions that affect the management of their homes. That is citizenship in action.

</p>

<a name="40916-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>For years after the Housing Act 1980 first introduced the statutory right to exchange, those arrangements worked well. Most local authorities permitted their secure tenants to carry out mutual exchanges with co-op tenants, even though their secure tenants did not have the statutory right to do so. However, since the Housing Act 1996 gave local authorities the power to use introductory tenancies, which many of them have done, many are saying they can no longer permit their secure tenants to exchange with co-op tenants because they do not have the statutory right to do so. My amendment seeks to give secure tenants that right. It seems harsh that a secure tenant in a local authority property who wishes to exchange amicably with a tenant in a housing co-operative is prohibited from doing so.
</p>

<a name="40916-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I am led to believe that the ODPM will argue that co-ops often have specific criteria that enable people to gain access. If co-ops fell within the statutory mutual exchange scheme, they would only be able to sift people out on the grounds already laid out, which may not be wide enough to meet their needs. The ODPM&#039;s view is that co-ops would not want to lose that flexibility. CDS Co-operatives tells me that it does not accept that reasoning, as it does not agree that co-ops&#039; flexibility is reduced. It also says that such reasoning,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;ignores the fact that, for 16 years, co-ops permitted mutual exchanges to occur providing the incoming tenant agreed to become a member of the co-op&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The ODPM seems to be arguing that to grant secure tenants the right to exchange with co-op tenants on the same basis that registered social landlords now do would breach the mutuality of the exchange arrangements in which both tenants have a right of exchange, the secure tenant&#039;s rights being statutory and the RSL-assured tenant&#039;s right being a contractual one in the tenancy agreement.
</p>

<a name="40916-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It is a general point, and I am not pleading that there are many people in such a situation, but it seems to me that the Government have an opportunity to put right an aspect of the existing arrangements that is causing difficulties in the already problematic area of tenancy rights. I know the people who run CDS Co-operatives. The chief officer, David Rodgers, who has been a friend of mine for years, speaks to me about these matters and has said that the amendment would ease the situation in many ways. I hope that the Minister can say something helpful.

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40916-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The amendment would diminish some rights also. We can appreciate that some tenants of fully mutual housing associations might well be prepared to give up the attraction of being a member of a co-operative for the benefits of a secure tenancy, but I doubt very much whether secure tenants would be prepared to enter into such an exchange, if it meant relinquishing their security of tenure and the possibility of right to buy. We do not think that the amendment is necessary. It seems reasonable to allow secure tenants of local authorities to exchange with assured tenants of housing associations because the tenancy rights are similar, but it does not make sense to provide a corresponding statutory right for secure tenants to exchange with tenants of a fully mutual housing association, where there is a big disparity between the tenants.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>There is another point, which I do not present as a major problem&#151;I think that I have it right. The amendment would also mean that tenants of co-operative housing associations, who might well be perfectly housed, would be enabled to jump the queue and gain allocation of a secure tenancy, in front of others who might be in much greater housing need or who have waited considerably longer.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>We are not sure whether the proposal is in the best interests of housing co-operatives, since it would encourage existing tenants to assign their tenancies to secure tenants who might not support the aims of the co-operative. Many years ago I was in a co-operative that freely agreed to split up. We may be able to come back to the matter on Report; we do not think that it is necessary, but we certainly could not accept the amendment as drafted by my noble friend.

I would have thought that the individuals involved, if they are sensible and reasonable, would look at the kind of problems that the Minister has raised before entering the agreement. If they are willing partners in an agreement and an exchange, so be it. The Minister has highlighted some of the practical problems that may arise. He has left me to think and, if necessary, to consult, before coming back at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40916-15_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="40916-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker </b>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 7 September be approved [<i>27th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I commend to the House the Business Improvement Districts (England) Regulations 2004 under Section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 and under Part 4 of the Local Government Act 2003, which we debated at considerable length last year&#151;it is a really exciting Act.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The sections and regulations provide for the setting up and operation of business improvement districts&#151;or BIDs, as they are now widely known. Under the scheme, local authorities and businesses would be encouraged to work together for the benefit of their local community. Projects under the scheme could include a wide range of different measures for improving the places where people work and live. That might involve increasing security, cleanliness, improving public access and the street environment, or enhancing or promoting the town centre or business area in some other way. The improvements would be funded by a levy raised on the non-domestic ratepayers or a defined class of ratepayers in the area covered by the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>However, before any proposal goes ahead, the businesses concerned would have the opportunity to vote in a ballot. To go ahead, schemes must be supported by more than 50 per cent of the local businesses balloted, both in terms of total numbers and of rateable value. That double requirement protects the interests of both small and large businesses in the area. There has been widespread interest in the scheme and enthusiasm for the opportunities it offers. A lot of energy and commitment have gone into ensuring that the bids are a success.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Pilots have been set up to develop proposals to the point of being ready to go to a ballot. The pilots are of different sizes and types, and in many different locations around the country. They have shown the great potential of the scheme to improve the local business environment. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Association of Town Centre Management for establishing 22 pilot schemes across the country; the Circle Initiative, for piloting the concept in five areas of central London; and the partners in the other independent schemes who have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1352"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1352</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taken forward ideas to transform their own areas, including those involved in the Kingston project, which may be one of the first to go to ballot.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>There have been concerns that the scheme has taken a long time to come into effect and that we are in danger of losing momentum. Although the level of enthusiasm and energy generated by the proposed scheme has been very encouraging, it would dissipate if the mechanism for putting it into effect were flawed and therefore we have taken time to consult fully on the proposals in the regulations to ensure that they are workable, practical and robust. Some issues have proved more complex than originally anticipated. Most pilot schemes have not yet reached the ballot stage and those that are ready will not have to wait much longer. I understand their frustration, but it is in the long-term interest to get it right.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>During the debates on the Local Government Act 2003, we discussed at length the issue of whether property owners as well as occupiers should be entitled to vote. I do not intend to revisit that issue here. There is nothing to prevent property owners making voluntary contributions, which we would encourage. We have also undertaken to conduct research into the role of property owners in business improvement districts, and we hope to have appointed a research body to take that forward by the end of next month.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>There have also been concerns about the level of information on the proposals provided at the ballot stage to those businesses entitled to vote. Anyone liable for a BID levy is entitled to receive a copy of the BID proposal and the proposed business plan, if they ask for a copy. There is a specific provision in the regulations for that. At the heart of the scheme is a partnership approach. We expect discussion and consultation among businesses in the area to take place at a very early stage in the development of the proposals, and that those discussions will continue over time, so the details should be familiar.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>If some businesses feel that there has been a material irregularity in the ballot, they can ask the Secretary of State to declare the ballot void or order a re-ballot. If businesses or the big proposers feel that the billing authority is acting unreasonably in vetoing the proposal, they can appeal against the veto. The appeal would take account of the billing authority&#039;s published policies and whether proper consultation took place before the proposal was put forward to the ballot.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Overall the scheme offers an opportunity for business and local government to work together for improvements in their joint interests. Those benefits are additional to what either local government or local business can provide individually. The regulations are fair, clear and contain the right checks and balances while encouraging innovation and productive local partnerships. It is a big incentive for people to work together. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="40916-15_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister said, we spent a considerable amount of time discussing this last year. We were not always entirely in agreement at the end of those discussions. I think we had hoped that by the time we reached this stage, everything would have been sorted out. However, I am sorry to say that we do not think that the regulations are drafted adequately.

</p>

<a name="40916-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The current drafting leaves individual BID bodies the responsibility of setting up schemes to deal with, in any BID levy arrangements, <i>inter alia</i> new hereditaments, split or merged hereditaments, deletions from the rating list, exemptions and properties treated as part-domestic. Failure to deal with these matters properly in BID arrangements could make it impossible for billing authorities to collect BID levies, and it is likely to create a series of significant legal disputes. Will the Minister indicate what was the thinking that ignored these aspects?
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Our understanding is that the lack of specification of these issues within the regulations will also result in BID arrangements varying widely throughout the country. We understand the intent is to allow maximum flexibility for BIDs to operate in the most suitable way, but this will make it difficult for multiple property occupiers to respond to BID proposals, as each BID arrangement will be different. Further consideration ought to be given to the means by which BID levy can deal with other technical issues.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The regulations do not prohibit any extension to the duration of the BID, any fundamental alteration to the scope of works or services, or any alteration to the identity of the service provider, without an alteration ballot. This seems unduly complicated, and the Minister might like to comment on it.

</p>

<a name="40916-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The BIDs guidance correctly highlights a number of advantages of incorporation for BIDs. Where incorporation is not adopted as the chosen legal status of the BID, then it will be essential to define clear financial accountability and reporting procedures in order to ensure and maintain partnership confidence in the financial soundness of the BID.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>BID proposers can include property owners. There is an anomaly here, in that owners who are not in occupation will not contribute to the BID levy other than in respect of vacant properties. Property owners may, therefore, attempt to use the role of BID proposers to enable them to improve the value of their properties without making any financial contribution. We touched on that when we debated this issue before.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The question of ballot costs could be crucial to the initiation of BID projects. BID proposers will be expected to show evidence that they can cover the cost of a ballot, though if successful they will be entitled to recoup the cost of the ballot from the ratepayers. Though the legislation does not specify that BID proposers necessarily pay the costs of the ballot if unsuccessful, they are obliged to demonstrate sufficient funds for this eventuality. This will be a substantial requirement and it should act as a deterrent to unfeasible BID proposals. None the less, there remains some concern that such BID proposals could be promoted and therefore the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1354"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1354</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

additional penalty of a threshold of support for a BID below which proponents would be required to pay the costs of a ballot could be deemed appropriate by certain billing authorities.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>We understand that the Government will be monitoring the operation of BIDS, and it may be that they will give further consideration to requiring evidence of written support for BID proposals from local ratepayers before a billing authority is obliged to proceed with ballot arrangements. Can the Minister confirm whether this is indeed the case?
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The definition of persons entitled to fund the BID ballot is imprecise and unclear in the regulations. In the case of limited companies, there needs to be some definition as to those persons entitled to approve funding as ratepayers in a BID ballot.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Finally, the availability of information ought to be closely monitored and policed by the relevant billing authority to ensure that information is used only for the purposes of establishing and voting on a BID project. We suggest that billing authorities should also be required to provide the rating list descriptions for properties that fall within the geographic area of the proposed BID. In many BID areas, it might not be the intention to charge every ratepayer but only certain categories of them&#151;for example, retailers or office occupiers. These descriptions may be a helpful starting point in seeking to identify relevant properties.
</p>

<a name="40916-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I realise that we are at the regulation stage, but these seem to us areas of omission. If the Minister can respond to them, we can have the matter on the record before the regulations are introduced.

<a name="40916-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches are enthusiasts for BID projects, and we wish them well. Thinking that I was not competent to judge the regulations, I arranged for some inquiries to be made of those who might have comments about them. I was able to find almost nothing by way of criticism or unhappiness. The Association of Town Centre Management says that it is happy, believes that the regulations are robust, and that this is due to the &quot;extensive stakeholder consultation&quot; which has been undertaken. I am delighted to be able to say that, because it is useful to know that at least so far&#151;fingers crossed&#151;that seems to have worked.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I have one minor point&#151;a query about whether businesses will be able to see how the BIDs levy is used by the local authority in its ring-fenced accounts. As I say that, I realise that the question more or less answers itself, but if the Minister has anything more to say, I would be grateful to hear it.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>We should remember that as these things are being developed, local residents need to be part of the consultation process. Not every area is exclusively commercial; even though they may not be part of the voting and the levy process, they will clearly have views about what is happening in their area. But, as I say, we wish the BIDs well.

<a name="40916-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I was very tempted to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for basically answering the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. I considered that what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said answered virtually all the questions that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked, and I was not going to detain the House, because it seemed repetitious. In other words, they have the flags out in some of the towns in this country because BIDs are on the way.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>There has been full consultation. There has to be proper guidance and full information so that people know what they are voting for and the cost. The fact is, there are 22 pilots around the country. I am reluctant to spend the time of the House reading out where the pilots are&#151;it is all a matter of public record.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Much of the business community was opposed to the idea of the 20 per cent threshold, thinking that it could lead to problems. We have responded to those concerns by removing the requirement to show the 20 per cent before going to the ballot. Instead, we have introduced the power in the regulations enabling local authorities to require BID proposers to pay for the cost of a ballot if less than 20 per cent of eligible ratepayers vote for the proposal.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The regulations require the Secretary of State to be notified in writing if a BID proposer intends asking the relevant BID authority to put the BID proposal to a ballot. This should enable a minimum level of information about potential projects to be gathered.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>One of the issues that was raised was who gets the ballot paper. With regard to a particular local address in a local authority, the variety around the country for small firms, particularly the national ones, is amazing. They all have their own arrangements. It is important that the right person gets the ballot paper, and that the person who gets the ballot paper understands what the BID is, even if it is 200 and 300 miles away near the head office where the rate bill is sent. All those factors can be taken into account in putting the register together.

</p>

<a name="40916-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Split hereditaments should be dealt with by the BID proposer in the BID proposals. We will provide extensive guidance on the development of a BID proposal. Defining all the different terms mentioned would have   involved extensive, complicated regulations and removed the flexibility. The point is that the BIDs will be different. All the areas in England are different. Bedford is different from Blackpool; Hull is different from Ealing; and Liverpool is different from Plymouth. Peterborough and Newquay are different, Manchester is not the same as Reading, and Swansea is not the same as Woolwich. All those are involved in pilot schemes. The last thing they want is for us to assume that they will all be the same. If they are all the same, we have failed. Perhaps a by-product of a successful BID would be that all the high streets stopped looking the same.

<a name="40916-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Filkin) </b>  rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 7 September be approved [<i>27th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the regulations concern the role of the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education and access plans. Perhaps I may say a few words about how the director&#039;s role fits into the overall package of reforms contained in the Higher Education Act 2004. As the House knows, the Act introduced variable tuition fees from 2006 and will provide significant additional funding to institutions.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>However, higher education institutions can charge higher fees only if they have first agreed an access plan with the Director of Fair Access. The Government are also providing significant resources to improve access to higher education. We are abolishing up-front fees and the deferred fees will be payable only when graduates are earning &#163;15,000, with any outstanding loan being written off after 25 years. Institutions no longer need to collect money directly from students. The Government pay the charge up front and graduates pay over time to the Government. We are greatly improving the student support package through new higher education grants of up to &#163;2,700 from 2006.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The freedom for universities to charge higher fees was a something-for-something arrangement; in other words, universities are to take responsibility for managing the potential consequences. Universities can charge higher fees only if they have considered and set out in an access plan the measures that they will be taking to safeguard access. Those plans will show how institutions will recycle some of their additional resources so that the needs of the poorest and most under-represented groups of potential students are not forgotten if fees increase. In practice, we expect that that will mean that universities promise more bursaries for the poorest students and more outreach work, both of which should bring greater benefits.

</p>

<a name="40916-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The Director of Fair Access will safeguard access to higher education when higher fees are introduced in 2006 through the approval and enforcement of the institution&#039;s access plans. OFFA will be a small organisation that is initially based within the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in Bristol, drawing on HEFCE&#039;s staff, expertise and resources. The director will be independent of government and free to do as he sees fit, subject to the Higher Education Act 2004 and the regulations. The Secretary of State&#039;s draft guidance states that the director should be well focused and non-bureaucratic in his approach.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I shall briefly mention changes that were agreed in the Lords. In doing so, I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Ashton of Upholland, whom I follow and who steered the Bill so ably through this House. I also acknowledge the significant contribution made by this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1357"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1357</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

House in shaping the policy, especially the role of the Director of Fair Access. The Higher Education Act is better due to this House&#039;s scrutiny. I shall give noble Lords the rubric of that. For example, the director cannot interfere with institutions&#039; admissions criteria or academic freedom, for which I acknowledge my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. The director has a power to identify and disseminate good practice on access&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. The director&#039;s remit may extend to part-time students&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. An institution cannot be sanctioned if it has taken all reasonable steps to comply with its plans&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Butler.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The Government accepted the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, on gap years, which provided that students who defer entry from 2005&#150;06 to 2006&#150;07 will not be charged fees above the standard fixed fee. The affirmative procedure for content, approval and financial penalties came from my noble friend Lady Warwick, although the Government are going further than that and the regulations before us today are being discussed as a single set. The contributions of those noble Lords show that the House of Lords is not merely a process that we have to get through, but that it adds value to our legislation and policy. I will probably be sacked for saying that, but never mind.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The regulations set out the content of plans; the procedure for approval, variation and publication; and how the director may enforce the plans. They also outline a review procedure which can be followed if an institution disagrees with a provisional decision by the director.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>On the content of plans, the regulations largely reflect the wording of examples in the Act. The purpose of access plans is to ensure that access is safeguarded, so it is only right that they should include the measures that the institution plans to take to attract more applicants from under-represented groups; the bursaries and other financial assistance that the institution will offer to students; and the financial information for them. There is a new addition to the regulations that will not be so familiar to the House. It will ensure that institutions inform prospective students of the aggregate fees that it will charge before they commit to a course.

</p>

<a name="40916-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>On the approval of plans, the key to the approval process is, hopefully, a grown-up dialogue between the director and an institution. Once approved, plans must be published and a plan can last for up to five years. Plans can be varied once approved with the approval of the director.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>On enforcement, I would not expect there to be a major need for enforcement action because we are talking about grown-up organisations, but the sanctions decrease the likelihood that one will need to take enforcement actions in any event. We expect institutions to uphold their access plans and dialogue will be an   important feature. The director must consider representations from the institution before imposing a sanction. The sanctions are to direct HEFCE or the TTA <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1358"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1358</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to impose financial requirements or to refuse to approve a new plan when the current plan expires. Where they need to be imposed, the financial penalties fall into two categories: the first can be restored to the institution once it has made good any breach and is equivalent to 110 per cent of the breach; the other is not restored, but has a ceiling of &#163;500,000.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The regulations put flesh on the bones of the review procedure, including the grounds for a review, if there is new evidence or evidence which the director wrongly disregarded or if he had acted disproportionately.
</p>

<a name="40916-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>These are important regulations which will give certainty to institutions as they begin to prepare their access plans. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for outlining the details of the regulations. With the summer Recess behind us, it seems a while since we gathered to debate higher education issues. However, the concerns and objections that we expressed at the time of the Bill have not diminished. With your Lordships&#039; forbearance, I shall briefly highlight them again.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>I echo the Minister in commending the Members of your Lordships&#039; House who worked so hard to improve the Bill. As a result, we were especially pleased with the inclusion of the all-important stronger protection for academic freedom; provisions for gap year students; and the improvement to the appeals system against OFFA decisions.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>As many of your Lordships know, we on these Benches believe that there is a much better way to raise funds for universities without forcing them to do a deal. Under the Government&#039;s scheme, universities would benefit financially only if they let the Director of Fair Access have what has been described as &quot;unwarranted interference&quot; in bodies that should be independent institutions.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>That is another sorry example of an attempt by the Government to interfere in a way that they should not. One can only believe that there is a form of social engineering behind the lack of independence of the regulator from the Government. Why do our universities need to be burdened with the added expense of time and money in order to adhere to a Director of Fair Access, with all the paraphernalia of regulation and bureaucracy of the office, only to try to achieve something that is already happening?
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Our universities are already doing good work to widen participation. Outreach programmes and summer schools are but two of the common tools already in use to achieve that end. The point that regularly reared its head during the debates on the Bill was that the root of the problem of encouraging wider participation lies in schools and not in the universities, despite it being the universities which will be penalised if they do not carry out government wishes.

<a name="40916-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I turn briefly to the detail of the regulations. We have always been concerned about the fines that the Director of Fair Access will have the power to impose under Regulation 10. We were informed during the passage of the Bill that if universities did not comply with the regulator they would be liable to fines of &#163;500,000, so we knew what was coming. However, earlier this week, my right honourable friend in another place highlighted the point that although we were forewarned about the &#163;500,000 fines, we were not warned about the provisions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Regulation 10, thus losing the opportunity to discuss them during the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Those bombshell paragraphs allow for an additional 10 per cent on top of the fees charged when a university does not meet the Government&#039;s requirements. This additional 10 per cent could be a substantial amount of money. This is an extension of the financial penalties available to the director that we consider to be unwarranted. Surely, in this case the fees alone should be penalty enough on institutions that are struggling financially to be able to carry out their work. Can the Minister explain this significant addition to the House and can he also explain why it was not brought up whilst the Bill was in Committee?
<a name="time_14"></a>
<a name="40916-17_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Bursaries are mentioned in Regulation 3. On Monday there was debate in the other place about the compulsion implied by the use of the word &quot;must&quot; in relation to the provision of bursaries by institutions that decide not to charge the full &#163;3,000 fees and thus do not have to provide &#163;300 bursaries. Taking it as it reads, Regulation 3 suggests that every institution has an obligation to provide a bursary, even if it is not charging a fee above the current level and even if it is not charging a fee at all. The Minister in the other place said in response to that debate that he would seek further clarification. I hope that the Minister can provide that here today.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>What will happen to those universities that charge only a couple of hundred pounds over the minimum fee? Will there be an obligation to provide a bursary from this amount? If so, could there not be a cut in the revenue from fees, again removing money from the pot? We must not forget that during the passage of the Bill it was highlighted that it would cost &#163;1.l billion to implement, while raising only &#163;900 million. Looking at the details of these regulations and, I expect, others in relation to this Act, it looks as though what money is raised will be spread more and more thinly.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Although improved by your Lordships, there was only so much that could be done to the Bill. These regulations are part and parcel of an unwelcome change that undermines the independence of our universities, while imposing extra costs in time, as well as a bureaucracy, on the very people who are trying against all the odds to educate our young people. It is a sad day for students and parents but as a general <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1360"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1360</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

election approaches voters will become more aware of the issues and will then have their say on the funding of higher education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="40916-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, I rise to thank the noble Lord for presenting these regulations and to congratulate him on mastering so quickly the brief that has fallen to him.

</p>

<a name="40916-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I too was musing that it does not seem long since we were discussing this and I too have abiding memories of our discussions. One is the incredible unity of the university glitterati. A second memory&#151;and it was mentioned in the thanks that the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, gave those who had contributed to the Bill&#151;is the concern of my noble friend Lady Sharp and throughout the House about people undertaking degrees on a part-time basis. That is the point to which I refer.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>We are very much in favour of widening access for all the reasons that I spoke about at the time when we were debating the Bill. I believe that there will be an incredible potential growth in part-time work. Therefore, it is surprising that there is no reference to part-time education in the regulations. It is in the Higher Education Act, at Section 32(1):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;The Director must perform his functions under this Part in such a way as to promote and safeguard fair access to higher education, (including part-time higher education in so far as his functions are exercisable in relation to it)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>But I see no reference in these regulations to part-time education. It would be useful if, in promoting their plans and their response to it, proper accord is given to the business of part-time work. It will be increasingly important.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>As the Minister will be aware, this is an Act over which we did not always see eye to eye. But all that is under the bridge. This is what we have and we have to work with it. Therefore, although we did not think that OFFA was needed and that HEFCE could cope with it, we have OFFA and it is very important that there are regulations for setting it up. Therefore, we support that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="40916-17_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, the Bill was enormously mangled in the House of Commons in order to get it through. The Government had great problems getting it through before it ever came to this House. We did our best and made some improvements but it was not easy to see that the Bill was going to be workable.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>This regulation takes my breath away. It is completely extraordinary to think that we have reached the point&#151;and we have apparently reached it, with the Liberal Democrat Front Bench happily accepting it&#151;where universities are simply not autonomous any more. Our most distinguished universities are going to be subject to these regulations. Some of our universities, which used to work under the government of local authorities, find this kind of regulation very much easier but our old universities, long-standing and distinguished ones, are going to be subjected to detailed scrutiny by this regulator in certain respects that I find completely extraordinary. They will do it on penalty of this enormous fine of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1361"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1361</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;500,000, as my noble friend said. I would like to read out one or two parts of the regulation because the way that universities are being treated would be laughable if it was not so tragic.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I have been on the governing bodies of three universities and I can imagine how they are going to have to react to this. It will be very time-consuming and they will have to bend their arrangements to the Government&#039;s will to an extent that I never thought would be possible. I am really surprised. I do not think   that we should say that our universities are autonomous anymore. They simply are not. They are being pushed around by the Government in a very detailed way and will have a big fine if they do not do what the Government want. I am very disappointed to see this regulation. We have to pass it and we will see what happens. It is very disappointing indeed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="40916-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in rising to respond to and thank noble Lords who have taken part in the discussion of these regulations, I should not be drawn back into a primary legislation debate by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, which was almost her invitation. However, I shall say that we are serious about trying to ensure that all people of whatever background have the opportunity for their talents to be fully exercised. That is part of what a civilised society is concerned about. If one instances the fact that one in four working class students with eight good GCSEs does not go to university, there are still issues in our society for us to address. They are issues that the vast majority of universities are concerned about, irrespective of Government and other political parties.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I turn to the specific questions that the noble Baroness raised on the regulations, one of which was about why there were the two regulations. That is a question that I asked myself when I was preparing for the debate. First, the matter of 110 per cent is not new. The issue was in the draft regulations published in February 2004 and July 2004. In essence, it operates like this: if either intentionally or unintentionally a higher education institution charges and does not fulfil the obligations to which it has committed itself in its access plan and, as a consequence, benefits by an extra income of&#151;for the sake of argument&#151;&#163;100,000, then there is the sanction of withdrawing &#163;110,000 from the grant that will be paid to it in future. The 110 per cent is specified because, if only 100 per cent were withdrawn, things would simply be back where they started from, and there would be no incentive for the institution to restore the agreement that it had set out and proposed in its access plan. When institutions comply with the undertaking that they have offered in their access plan, as we expect that they shall, the 110 per cent is restored, so they end up not having lost a penny. That is essential, because I suspect that most of these issues will be ones of mistake rather than malice.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>It is important that there be an effective, quick and proportionate incentive for institutions to comply. Because that sanction is there, I believe that it will be very rarely needed, because it is clear that there is no net gain or benefit from&#151;how shall one put it?&#151;&quot;mucking about&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1362"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1362</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The second measure, relating to the sum of up to &#163;500,000 is a further sanction that is even less likely to be needed. It is essentially saying that it is possible to envisage, for someone of a particularly suspicious mind, a set of circumstances in which an institution kept on trying it on and did not actually fulfil the undertaking. An institution might make a breach and be sanctioned 110 per cent, apply and get the 110 per cent back, and then constantly go round in that loop. That is extremely unlikely ever to occur, but there is a sanction of a permanent penalty rather than the temporary docking of grant that the 110 per cent achieves.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, asked whether institutions would have to provide bursaries if they charged only a few hundred pounds over the standard fee. The answer is no, unless they have set it out in their access plan that they put forward to the director that they would provide bursaries. If in their proposal they do not say that they will provide bursaries and the access plan is agreed, there is clearly no obligation on them to provide bursaries. If, however, they said that they would provide bursaries in X or Y circumstances, and that was the plan agreed, they would be obliged to do so.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Shutt, about part-time study. The relevance of part-time study to widening access has always, historically&#151;going back 100 years or more&#151;been massively important in our society. It will continue to be so. While the regulations do not need to use the words &quot;part time&quot;, because they can encompass that idea, I agree with him that in putting forward access proposals, consideration of part-time opportunities is important.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I was saddened to hear that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, was so unhappy about the primary legislation and also, by implication, the regulations. I do not believe that they will take away universities&#039; autonomy. Universities have the freedom to charge higher fees if they want to, not the obligation to do so. The intention is that they are incentivised by the process to consider how they can continue their excellent efforts, in many cases, to widen access. If they want to charge fees, there is a light-touch process for ensuring that they have given thought to doing so, and it must be as non-bureaucratic as possible.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I hope that I have done as much as I can to answer to the questions raised.
</p>

<a name="40916-17_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="40916-18_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="40916-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton </b>   rose to move, That the draft regulatory reform order laid before the House on 24  June be approved [<i>24th Report from the Regulatory Reform Committee</i>].
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1363"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1363</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the order is brought forward under the Regulatory Reform Act   2001, by the Wales Office. There are three Welsh public sector ombudsmen: the Welsh Administration Ombudsman, the Health Service Commissioner for Wales and the Commission for Local Administration in Wales. The purpose of the order is to enable the same individual to be appointed to all three public sector ombudsman offices in Wales as an interim step to establishing, when parliamentary time allows, a unified office led by a single individual&#151;a public services ombudsman for Wales.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Your Lordships will know that the Commission for Local Administration in Wales is more commonly referred to as the Local Government Ombudsman or the Local Commissioner. What is not so well known is that the commission actually consists not only of the Local Commissioner but also, ex-officio, the Welsh Administration Ombudsman and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. But it is only the Local Commissioner who is empowered to undertake investigations that fall within the jurisdiction of the commission. The effect of this is that the Local Commissioner and the Welsh Administration Ombudsman cannot be one and the same person, but that is precisely what needs to happen if the ombudsman offices are to be brought together.

</p>

<a name="40916-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Therefore, the purpose of the order is to amend the Local Government Act 1974 to remove a restriction, the effect of which is to prevent the Welsh Administration Ombudsman, although a commissioner, from undertaking investigations as the Local Commissioner. Its practical effect would be to allow the two offices of Local Commissioner and Welsh Administration Ombudsman to be held simultaneously by the same person. Legislation already provides for the office of Welsh Administration Ombudsman and Health Service Commissioner for Wales to be held by the same person. The order would apply to Wales alone.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>There has been extensive consultation, both on the overall policy objective to unify public sector ombudsman services in Wales and on the proposal to enable a single individual to be appointed to all three offices now. There is unanimous support for both. The House will wish to note that the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform agreed that the Local Government Act imposed a burden by preventing the Welsh Administration Ombudsman from acting as local commissioner and should be removed by way of the proposed order; agreed that it would not remove any necessary protections or any rights or freedom which a person might reasonably expect to continue or exercise; and agreed that adequate consultation had taken place.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>However, the committee considered that a requirement in the Local Government Act, that the local commissioner is appointed only after consultation with the appropriate representative body, is a form of protection that should be retained. The committee is satisfied that the order before the House has been amended to provide that the person appointed as Welsh Administration Ombudsman can be the local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1364"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1364</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commissioner only if that appointment is made following consultation with the appropriate representative body&#151;which, in this instance, will be the Welsh Local Government Association.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The Regulatory Reform Committee in the House of Commons unanimously agreed that the order be approved. In conclusion, I thank members of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform for the time they spent scrutinising the proposal and for recommending the proposal to the House.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>In commending the draft order to the House, I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, to the Front Bench to speak for the Liberal Democrats. To have one Lord Roberts is a benefit; to have two is more than one can hope for. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Moved, That the draft regulatory reform order laid before the House on 24  June be approved [<i>24th Report from the Regulatory Reform Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton.</i>)
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40916-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, to the Front Bench on the Liberal side of the House. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, for her presentation of the order.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>We fully appreciate the purpose behind the order, which is to enable the combination of the three ombudsman posts and the eventual establishment of a public services commissioner for Wales to cover the devolved areas of government. The proposal has been talked about since 1998, when it was first proposed to the Secretary of State by the National Assembly advisory group.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>There has, as the noble Baroness said, been extensive consultation on the order, as required by the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place and the similar committee in your Lordships&#039; House have thoroughly examined the issues and the Government have accepted their recommendations regarding consultation with the National Assembly and local government.

</p>

<a name="40916-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>We assume that the Government are satisfied that the three posts can be combined to advantage and without loss of functional efficiency and effectiveness. I take it that the Government are of the view that a single commissioner can do the job properly and effectively; that it will not be too onerous or so burdensome that the work cannot be adequately performed. Of course we are aware that the Parliamentary Commissioner&#151;the fourth commissioner, as it were&#151;will remain to deal with complaints arising from the non-devolved areas of Government.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Perhaps the Minister can give us a firm assurance on the point that the development will,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;not remove any necessary protection or prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>although those words are in the preamble to the order. I ask because the duties performed by the commissioners are of the utmost importance to individual citizens who have a complaint of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1365"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1365</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

maladministration against central, regional or local government or health authorities, all of which are subject to examination by the commissioners.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I have in the past read the commissioners&#039; annual reports, which contain accounts of their investigations of individual complaints. They are always interesting and revealing. They often show the commissioners as the last resort of the citizen fighting to right a wrong he or she has suffered or believes he has suffered.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The areas covered by the commissioners are varied and extensive, but they are brought together by the common denominator of maladministration, which is the commissioners&#039; real concern. There is no reason in my view why the diversity of subjects covered should   prevent a combination of offices because maladministration is the same whether it occurs in a department of state, the National Assembly, a local or a health authority. It has the same characteristic features in all spheres.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The second assurance we seek is that there are positive advantages to be gained and that the combination is not simply a money-saving exercise. I am all in favour of saving taxpayers&#039; money but not at the expense of taxpayers&#039; rights.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Finally, I note that we may expect some primary legislation relating to this proposal to come before us in the near future. Bearing in mind the extensive and laborious consultation required for an order under the 2001 Act and the pressure on parliamentary time, it is surprising that the Government have not rolled all this into one parliamentary Bill. One is bound to ask why we must have this preliminary order when it is to be followed by primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I believe the answer to some of the points lies in the present situation in Wales where the two offices of   Health Service Commissioner and Welsh Administration Ombudsman are currently held by the same person, Mr Adam Peat, whom I had the pleasure of knowing as a very able, young civil servant when I was a Minister in the Welsh Office. It is intended that a third office&#151;that of local commissioner&#151;should be added to these two when the present incumbent of that office retires, which I believe is in the not too distant future. That combination then leaves the way open to create a single post of public services ombudsman for Wales and, as I have said, that will require primary legislation. I only hope that the Government will find time for it in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40916-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the welcome from the two Front Benches. It is a delight to be able to speak&#151;I am sure, on a temporary basis&#151;from the Front Bench. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and I, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, are living holiday brochures. The Welsh Tourist Board should recognise us in some way or another.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>As Liberal Democrats we welcome this reform. The co-ordination of services is useful and helpful. Already we know how effectively the complaints can be dealt with. I am told the latest local government report contained 183 allegations in Wales, of which 85 were accepted, and the health service had 180 complaints; so it is a worthwhile office.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40916-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>When we have the united office, it will overcome confusion and overlapping. People have asked me, and I have myself asked, &quot;Where do I complain? Who do I go to in order to redress this situation?&quot;. We hope that when the office of one public services commissioner is established the guidelines will be clear and easily available to all people who feel that they have some allegation or some complaint to make.
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I look forward very much to reading soon the first report of the new public services commissioner. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, mentioned, we hope that that post will be established soon. Will the Minister tell us how soon that is likely to be?
</p>

<a name="40916-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>I have consulted Assembly Members in Wales and they, too, welcome this reform and hope that it will be in place soon. I join in supporting the reform proposed by the Government.

<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="40916-19_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Thank you, my Lords. I recognise the value to tourism in Wales for those of us who frequently visit Wales on holiday. It is not necessary, but I fear that not everyone fully appreciates the beauty of Wales&#151;yet. Both noble Lords can help with that.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The issues that have been raised are important. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked why we did not wait for the Bill. The offices fell vacant naturally last year, so we are taking advantage of an opportunity that has presented itself to take an interim self-contained step towards the longer-term policy objectives. A Bill will be presented as soon as parliamentary time is available.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>Noble Lords also asked about the benefits of the reform. It will allow progress to be made in implementing the wider proposals for a unified office. One person will be better placed to raise the profile of the office and make easier the resolution of complaints that straddle the jurisdiction of the different offices.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>There will be no impact on the right of individuals in this case. The time limit remains at 12 months from the time at which matters gave rise to complaint. The ombudsman already has discretion to extend that time limit. That goes for all three offices.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The time commitment of such a commissioner is not an issue. There is no reason to doubt that the office holder will not have every opportunity to exercise properly his respective jurisdictions. He must prepare annually a report to lay before the Assembly for debate on the performance of each office.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para4"></a>

<p><a name="st_164"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to a number of amendments that are all related to the welfare of park home owners. I declare an interest as the honorary secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Welfare of Park Home Owners. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is present as she often attends committee meetings at which park homes are discussed.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The background is very interesting. For many, many years the organisations that represent park home owners have brought to the parliamentary committee a series of what one can only term distress signals regarding the hurt that has been visited upon their members by some site owners. Let me make it clear that the view I hold is shared by many; namely, that while there are a number of site owners who are unfair and unjust, and sometimes downright bad, many others are reasonable, sensible and dispense justice and interpret their regulations and rules in a fair manner.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The Minister knows very well what has happened over the years. Ministers from the ODPM, including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, when he had responsibility for these matters, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and a series of Ministers in the Commons have all attended meetings and have tried to resolve the problems. When the Housing Bill was undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny evidence was given regarding why there ought to be a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1368"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1368</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

complete revision of the law relating to park homes. I attended the relevant meeting with the honourable Member in another place, Mr Hilton Dawson, who is the chairman of the all-party group. We were given the good news that the case had been made and that the Government ought to bring in legislation perhaps within the next two years. Those involved with park homes have literally been overwhelmed by the speed with which the Government have responded to the case that has been made.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>In particular I wish to pay tribute to the Minister, Yvette Cooper, who attended two meetings in rapid succession and gave the clear impression that she understood what the problems were, and agreed, when the Bill went through the other place, to a series of amendments to it, all of which were beneficial to park home owners. I particularly want the Minister to note that the general attitude in the park home community is one of appreciation for the manner in which the Government&#151;which of course goes from the Deputy Prime Minister right down to all of his Ministers&#151;have taken that on board. I am advised that there is an excellent liaison between the civil servants who are responsible for monitoring these matters and for advising the Ministers. I have no complaint whatever. Inevitably, like Oliver Twist, I want some more.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I ask the Minister if he could give the Committee, and those affected, the current thinking on two of the matters covered by the amendments. It is all borne out of experience. I remember the Minister last night pleading in aid on an issue a number of letters that backed up his case. He was very careful to say, of course, that Ministers receive the views of many people and these were just a few. The sad fact is that when I asked for comparable evidence of the case I want to make, there was general view that people were frightened and unwilling to put complaints of this kind in writing. It is a fact, in the park home world, that there are some situations in which elderly, frail and sometimes disabled people&#151;who are glad to be living on the park&#151;are very, very reluctant to complain and say things that could get back to the site owner. That is a fact of life. But I ask the House and the Minister to listen carefully to one of the burdens of the complaint, the arbitrary manner in which some site owners determine where the home should be, whether it should be moved and whether they have got the right to move.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>On the first of two main amendments I am speaking to, I ask the Minister if he would either incorporate our amendment or come back at a later stage, or even say that the matter is currently being dealt with in negotiations with park home owners. That relates to the actual boundary of the site. They want it to be specific, but they also want to dot the &quot;i&quot;s and cross the &quot;t&quot;s as to how communications are made. One of the amendments I am speaking to is that any communications on these matters should be referred to the parties not only by post, but by registered post.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I turn to the question of what is called the five-year rule. It is a fact that the question of the five-year period is in the 1983 Act, and is very often used as a threat by some site owners against people who may not be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1369"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1369</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

willing to go to court and to bludgeon timid park home owners into agreeing to things. We believe that this ought to be left in. In general, we believe that a park owner who effectively denies the resident the right to sell their home by using the conditions of the home, dissuading the buyer or other tactics, should be liable to severe penalties. It is not just a question of the five years, because the prospective purchaser may very well be influenced and disaffected in going forward with the purchase if it is seen that the site owner is unreasonable.
</p>

<a name="40916-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I move the amendment with gratitude to the Minister and his ministerial colleagues, and in the firm belief that there is a case to be made. It may well be that the Minister will tell us that these are ongoing matters, but I provide the Minister with a chance to say some kind words. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="40916-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I speak to my Amendment No. 227 which is grouped with these amendments. Its purpose is to make sure that mobile home owners are dealt with in the same way as any other dweller of a house, be it a mobile home or house of bricks and mortar&#151;indeed, if the amendment is agreed to, houseboat owners, would also be included. It is about renewable energy grants.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Perhaps the Minister can explain to me why it is that the Government&#039;s &quot;Clear Skies&quot; renewable energy grants have certain eligibility criteria. They are, first, that the applicant must the owner of the property; secondly, that the applicant must be resident in the UK; and, thirdly, that the property must be located in the UK. However, the fourth states that the system must supply a building and not a mobile home, caravan or houseboat. The guidance for the grant states that those are not eligible. Mobile homes and houseboats are harder to insulate and make more energy efficient because the construction of a mobile home lends itself less well to that. To heat it, you are going to need to use carbon, just as in any other sort of property, such as a house of bricks and mortar. Being able to apply for a grant which enables you to use solar energy, wind energy or any of the others listed under Clear Skies grants is at least as important&#151;perhaps it is more important&#151;as it is for a house. But it is at least equally important. This amendment is intended to probe the Government&#039;s thinking about why they have excluded all of those classes of homeowners from being able to apply for these grants.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40916-20_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I support the amendment of my noble friend Lady Miller. I say to the Minister, although I am sure he realises this, that the Home Energy Conservation Act did, in fact, cover mobile homes. So, when people are trying to insulate their homes, that is certainly possible. It is unfortunate that we are not consistent about how we treat forms of homes other than bricks and mortar when we are looking at legislation. I welcome the amendments in this Bill for those who live in park homes, because for a long time I thought they should be cast as mainstream housing legislation. I have made that clear in speeches before, so I will not labour it today.

</p>

<a name="40916-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>With the leave of the Committee, I realise that my amendment on mobile homes has been put in a very funny place on the Marshalled List. I thought it was because it was a new clause but when I read it again I realised that that had nothing to do with it. For some reason, it has got in the wrong place. I mention that because it is a related area.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>My Amendment No. 229C is about the &quot;fit and proper person&quot; status of those who run park home sites. This was discussed in another place, and at that time Yvette Cooper said that they were getting consultants&#039; reports shortly after Easter. I agree with her that it is not something you can legislate on quickly. But given that this Bill has a very effective way of dealing with the licensing of landlords for houses of multiple occupation, it seems to me that it is not that difficult. I would like to know how far the Government have got.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I end by saying that, with the noble Lord, Lord   Graham, I have worked in this area for a number of years. If I might use somewhat unparliamentary language&#151;the sort of language that the Minister sometimes uses&#151;we have faffed around on this for a number of years before actually getting to something satisfactory, and we are really very glad. One of the main problems is that the few sites that treat people appallingly are the problem. That is one of the key points missing from the very good amendments that the Government have brought forward on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>When I was a Member of another place&#151;I represented Christchurch&#151;my constituency had a huge number of people who lived in park homes, many of them elderly. They choose to live there because it is a safe environment and a small property to look after, and because they have friends there to look after them. That is one reason why I think the area important. I welcome what the Government are doing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="40916-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   If I may, I shall jump to Amendment No. 229C, to which the noble Baroness has just referred, before I come to the others.

</p>

<a name="40916-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The Government accepted many of the recommendations of the park homes working party, including those relating to site licensing and in principle the licensing of site owners. However, the amendment proposed to implement those recommendations will not   work in practice. We are currently drafting a consultation paper to carry out detailed consideration of all the site licensing recommendations, drawing comparisons with licensing regimes in the private rented sector. As part of this work we are considering whether a requirement that the licence holder be a fit and proper person is necessary and, if it is, whether the fit-and-proper-person criteria for a licence holder for a park home site should be the same as that for a house-in-multiple-occupation licensee. We are also considering what procedures would be necessary to ensure that new site owners met the criteria for being a fit and proper person on transfer of site licences. I hope that that brief response will satisfy the noble Baroness on Amendment No. 229C.

</p>

<a name="40916-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I shall now deal with Amendment No. 215 and the others to which my noble friend spoke. I have some good news. Clause 183 requires the owners of park home sites to provide a written statement setting out the terms and conditions of an agreement to occupy a pitch on a site to the occupier at least 28 days before that agreement commences. Amendment No. 215 seeks to tweak that provision by adding the specifics of the boundaries of the pitch and the services provided on the pitch. The aim is to reduce greatly the number of disputes.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>We considered the revised wording suggested to the original draft of the Bill. However, it was felt that there were difficulties that needed to be explored, and therefore it was thought necessary to consult relevant stakeholders. Those issues have now been resolved, and the topics are discussed in the consultation paper on implied terms and written statements that was published at the end of July. I therefore hope that my noble friend will not seek the need to pursue Amendment No. 215 today.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Amendment No. 216 concerns the service of the written statement by post to occupiers. We are going to be haunted by postal voting and post, although I know that we are not talking about voting. I was waiting for postal voting to come up on the BIDs regulations; I had a note on them, but they did not come up so I did not use it. Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 will apply in the circumstances, which means that the service will be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting a letter containing the document. Prepaying means putting a stamp on it. One has to keep a straight face saying all that; it is difficult. Unless the contrary is proved, service will be deemed to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. That leaves a bit to be debated, does it not? That is not an attack on the postal workers, by the way, but on their barmy management. I do not want to be misunderstood on that.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>The problem with requiring service by recorded delivery is that actual receipt is not until the letter can be delivered to someone prepared to take receipt and sign for it. It was felt that by using Section 7 of the Interpretation Act, the site owner can be confident when service is going to be deemed to have taken place, so that he can properly comply with the requirement to serve 28 days. Of course, it would be prudent for him to obtain proof of posting, but that need not be by recorded delivery. There is therefore an adequate way out of the problem.

</p>

<a name="40916-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>Amendment No. 217 seeks to extend the provision about removing age that is already in the clause, to remove the five-year relevant period which also forms part of the grounds for termination. The five-year rule effectively breaks the life of a mobile home up into five-year relevant periods. We agree with my noble friend that whether that is useful should be re-examined. Therefore, we proposed a choice of options concerning paragraph 6 in the consultation paper on implied terms and written statements that was published at the end of July. When we receive the results of the consultation, we will be in a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1372"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1372</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

better position to decide whether the five-year rule should stay or go. I hope that my noble friend will take that as a useful response.
</p>

<a name="40916-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Before I come to the government amendments in the group, I should deal with Amendment No. 227. It is quite nice the way people write my notes; it says here that the amendment has the noble intention to give residents of mobile homes the same access to energy grants as people in bricks-and-mortar housing. It is a proposal with which the Government agree wholeheartedly. However, the amendment is unnecessary as mobile home owners are already eligible for four types of energy grant&#151;private sector renewal, disability facilities grants, Warm Front grants, and energy efficiency commitment. I agree with my officials; we have no idea so far as Clear Skies grants are concerned. I have never heard of them.

<p><a name="st_175"></a>The noble Lord said: It gives me considerable pleasure to move the amendment. For many years, one of the things that I, as chair of a housing committee and leader of a council in an area where about a fifth of the local population lived in private rented accommodation, thought was most iniquitous was the deposits that tenants paid and their frequent failure to be able to recover them at the end of their tenancy. It was nothing short of a national scandal.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The new clauses proposed by Amendments Nos.   222A, 222B, 222C, 222D and the new Schedule proposed in Amendment No. 230B provide for the introduction of tenancy deposit schemes. Such schemes should protect deposit moneys paid by tenants to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1375"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1375</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

landlords or their agents. Tenants pay deposits in good faith, expecting that they will be returned at the end of the tenancy provided the tenant leaves the property in much the same condition as they found it, subject of course to &quot;wear and tear&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Landlords value deposits as a guarantee that their tenants will meet these obligations and be committed to safeguarding their property. A deposit provides some cover against the costs of damage caused by tenants, whether deliberate or accidental.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>For the majority of tenancies, landlords repay deposits in good faith and without undue deductions. Most landlords are keen to foster good relationships with their tenants. If tenants treat their rented property appropriately, such landlords will, at the end of the tenancy, repay the deposits without a fuss. In most instances where a tenant has caused damage to the property or broken some other obligation, both parties should be able to agree amicably on the landlord retaining part of the deposit to cover repairs or other expenses and on returning the remainder to the tenant. However, government statistics have shown that, in a significant minority of cases of around 20 per cent, tenants who had a tenancy ending in the previous three years felt that their landlord had unreasonably retained all or part of their deposit. Unfortunately, there are some landlords who make it a practice of always withholding their tenants&#039; deposits.

</p>

<a name="40916-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>A consequence of the actions of this minority of bad landlords is that they stigmatise the whole of the private rented sector, with all landlords being regarded as money-grabbing shady characters waiting to rip off innocent tenants. As a result, many decent landlords find that their tenants default on their last month&#039;s rent in the expectation that their deposit will not be returned to them. I am afraid that, although the majority of landlords may consider that they are doing the right thing, the high turnover in the private rented sector&#151;over 40 per cent per annum&#151;means that a large proportion of tenants can easily experience bad practice.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The better landlords and agents see a need to tackle the abuse of tenancy deposits. They participated in the pilot voluntary tenancy deposit scheme that was set up by the Government and run by the Independent Housing Ombudsman from March 2002 to March 2004. In May this year, the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) set up an independent tenancy deposit scheme for its members, based on the pilot.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The take-up for the pilot tenancy deposit scheme was disappointingly low, indicating the need for legislation to ensure complete coverage of all deposits taken in the private rented sector. The problems faced by tenants in getting their deposits back have been highlighted by organisations such as Shelter and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, and in the responses which we received to our consultation paper <i>Tenancy Money: Probity and Protection</i>, which we issued in November 2002.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>In that consultation, we looked at a range of options for safeguarding deposits, both legislative and non-legislative. We considered purely voluntary schemes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1376"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1376</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

set up and run by industry. Such schemes would be likely to be non-custodial and would need some insurance cover to provide an assurance that they could meet their liabilities if the landlord or agent defaulted. The landlord or agent would retain the deposit and any failure on their part to repay it to the tenant would be covered by the scheme&#039;s reserves and insurance guarantees.

</p>

<a name="40916-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>That option was the one that was most favoured by landlords and agents. However, we concluded on the low take-up of the pilot that such schemes would be likely to attract only the decent landlords or agents who already engaged in good practice and not the rogue element that we are seeking to capture.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>We also considered establishing a single government-sponsored custodial scheme, where landlords and agents would transfer deposits into a specified account operated by the scheme. This option was most favoured by tenants and their representative organisations.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>However, there is much to be said for encouraging an innovative approach based on more than one scheme. Certainly, there is a good case for making use of the professional knowledge and expertise that industry bodies have by allowing some scope for that to be used in establishing tenancy deposit protection.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>We finally considered a hybrid of the two options, whereby the Government would procure a custodial scheme, to meet any gaps in schemes proposed by the industry, and industry bodies would also have the opportunity to come forward with their own schemes which, providing they met certain minimum standards, would receive government approval. However, we wish to ensure that any organisation chosen to run a tenancy deposit scheme is chosen on the basis of a fair selection process and that no particular organisation is given an unfair financial and competitive edge. Therefore, we have decided against setting up two different systems to select scheme administrators.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The proposed clauses give the appropriate national authority the flexibility to make arrangements with either private organisations or public bodies to administer such schemes. However, the Secretary of State&#039;s intention in relation to England is to open up the opportunity to set up and run both custodial and insurance-based schemes to all private organisations, rather than just industry bodies.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>We will still be looking for a range of schemes, but by choosing schemes as a result of competitive tendering processes, the Government can thoroughly examine the merits of each proposed scheme against certain set criteria. That should lead to a higher quality of scheme being procured. We would expect, and indeed welcome, bids for the tender from organisations currently running voluntary schemes.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 222A places a duty on the appropriate national authority&#151;the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly for Wales&#151;to ensure that at least one tenancy deposit scheme is set up. The main purposes of a tenancy deposit scheme will be to safeguard tenancy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1377"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1377</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deposits paid in connection with an assured shorthold tenancy and to facilitate the resolution of disputes arising in connection with the deposits.

</p>

<a name="40916-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>We intend for the national authority to be able to enter into contractual arrangements with private organisations to set up and run such schemes on its behalf. Through the contractual relationship, government will be able to review the administration of schemes, monitor the accounts and provide other information to ensure that schemes continue to offer value for money. Such schemes are expected to be self-financing, although the authority may be able to contribute to start-up costs if it feels that that is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 222B provides that no landlord can take a deposit&#151;which can only be money&#151;unless it is safeguarded by a scheme. That will offer maximum protection to tenants and puts the onus on the landlord to ensure that if they wish to take a deposit, the deposit must be safeguarded by an authorised scheme. This reassurance should also reduce the likelihood of tenants withholding their last month&#039;s rent in anticipation of not getting their deposit returned.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>A landlord will have to tell their tenant which scheme their deposit is being held under and details of the relevant legislation under which the deposit will be protected. The tenant will then be able to check with the scheme that that is the case.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 222C deals with the court proceedings for tenancy deposits. Where a landlord fails to tell the tenant which scheme their deposit is held under, or the tenant is unable to obtain confirmation from a scheme that the deposit is safeguarded, the tenant will be able to get an order for the landlord to appear in court and account for that. If the landlord does not turn up in court or does not give enough evidence to satisfy the court, the court can require, at its discretion, for the deposit to be returned to the tenant or transfer it to an authorised custodial scheme. That must be done within 14 days.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 222D describes the civil sanctions that landlords will face for non-compliance with the provisions set out in Amendment No. 222B. Where a landlord does not hold a deposit in accordance with a scheme or fails to tell the tenant which scheme it is held under, he will not be able to serve the usual two months&#039; notice to the tenant to regain possession of the property. As well as that, where a court has ordered the return of the deposit to the tenant in accordance with the proposed new clause in Amendment No. 222C and that has not been undertaken, the tenant will then be owed an amount equal to three times the deposit amount. Such procedural and financial penalties should make landlords think twice about trying to operate outside the new scheme.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>All schemes must comply with the provisions of the proposed new schedule set out in Amendment No. 230B. All schemes must ensure that the correct amount of deposit is returned to the relevant party within 10 days of the landlord and tenant agreeing how much the tenant is to receive, or within 10 days of the scheme being notified of a court decision.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1378"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1378</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-21_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>All schemes must respond as soon as practicable to any request from a tenant to confirm that the scheme is safeguarding their deposit. Perhaps, most importantly, all schemes must also ensure that they offer some form of alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms, so that disagreements over deposits can be resolved without the unnecessary expense of going to court. Such mechanisms will be able to provide a cheaper, quicker alternative to the courts. However, they cannot displace the courts and both parties have the option of taking the matter to court either in the first instance, or if they are unhappy with any decision reached by alternative resolution.
</p>

<a name="40916-21_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Amendment No. 242ZA amends Clause 213 to specify the parliamentary procedure applicable to orders or regulations made by the Secretary of State. Amendments Nos. 254 and 256 amend Clause 231, which deals with commencement and extent. These provisions are to come into force in relation to Wales by order of the National Assembly for Wales and in relation to England by order of the Secretary of State. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="40916-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We have tabled Amendment No. 238N in this group which we will not move. Perhaps I may make some general comments on the amendment that the Minister has just moved.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Obviously, we support this scheme in general. Like other parts of the Bill in the past few days there has been much information about it, and the noble Lord has just given much more information which we need to digest and think about. The explanations he gave about the scheme and the way in which it might be operated need some analysis before we can make much comment.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Much of my original notes are now totally irrelevant since we had the statement from the Minister. However, the schedule does seem to deal mainly with two situations. It seems to protect mainly tenants and their deposit. I did not pick up in the Minister&#039;s explanation of what happens when tenants are in arrears with their rent. Can that deposit then be used to offset part of the rent? That was one of my concerns.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>There is another problem when tenants have left, cannot be traced and the arrears might be more than the deposit. There are several solutions that one could examine. Although we support the thrust of the amendment, has there been enough consultation with both sides of the industry&#151;landlords and tenants? The Minister&#039;s comments that the proposal is to go out to tender for a scheme, if I am correct, were interesting. That would seem a novel departure and something that I would probably support. If one is going out to tender, there needs to be careful thought over what the tender is for. We need more detail about that.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>These schemes will cost money, like everything else in the Bill. We do not know exactly where that will come from. I shall not say much more today. I wish to examine this matter in considerable detail, and, like <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1379"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1379</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

many other issues, we shall have a more detailed discussion on Report, when we have analysed what the Minister has said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="40916-22_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I very much welcome these new clauses. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, it is difficult for us, in that we have not had time to examine this matter in much detail. I have one or two questions. This is an issue that has been around for a long time and we are all delighted. These Benches have campaigned on it for a number of years. I can remember present members of the Government pushing for this in the 1996 Housing Bill when the Conservatives were in control. We are now in 2004 and I am just beginning to think that perhaps when we get to the next housing Bill most of the matters that we discussed in 1996 will have been enacted. It has taken a long time. I appreciate that it is not an easy   issue, but it was on 19 May&#151;I remember that clearly, because it was my birthday&#151;that the Minister in another place, Keith Hill, announced that the Government would be introducing these amendments. It is disappointing that we are not in a position to be able to flesh this out more in Committee because of the lateness of attempting to put them on the statute book.
<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="40916-22_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Much of the detail will be left to schedules and some of the questions will still be unanswered. I hope that the Minister will assure us that there will be full consultation with all the interested parties, not just the industry, over how the secondary legislation will be developed and how the schemes will be set out. The Minister will know that Shelter and the Citizens Advice Bureaux have been campaigning with us for many years. One area that concerned them was the dispute resolution function which the Minister has just explained. Everyone is very pleased that that has been included.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>There are some concerns regarding non-compliance by landlords. It depends how the schemes work. If the landlord pays a deposit into the scheme but does not comply by returning it if tenants are being evicted, then there is something that can be used against the landlord&#151;they would forgo the automatic Section 21 grounds for possession. But if tenants leave and find that the landlord has not paid the deposit into the scheme, they will not be in a better position than they were originally. That is an area that we shall explore further on Report. In the mean time, perhaps the Minister will explain how that would work.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Some proposals have been put to me regarding how the matter could be dealt with. Perhaps tenants should always pay the deposits into the scheme themselves. There has been a suggestion that where tenants find that the landlord has not paid the deposit into the scheme, then the tenants could withhold their rent. The Government would probably not wish to permit that because encouraging people to withhold rents is not generally a good idea.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>One or two other queries have been raised with me by the British Property Federation in connection with the Law Commission&#039;s proposals on tenancy reform. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1380"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1380</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Originally, that was to be considered with the reform of tenancy legislation and there is still a situation where landlords are not necessarily required to provide a written agreement. How will that play with the Government&#039;s proposals? Regarding the insurance schemes that the Minister mentioned, many people feel that the bureaucracy surrounding the regulation of those by the Financial Services Authority means that people might not be keen to come forward with those schemes.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, it has been tricky for us to get to grips with the amendments in a few days and I am sure that we shall return to the issue on Report. If the Minister cannot answer my questions today, perhaps he can help us out between the two stages.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="40916-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I am pleased to be able to speak on this matter and I declare an interest as a small landlord for more than 40 years. This is an important issue. I am familiar with the New South Wales system in Australia, whereby all deposits are held centrally. The system works well and there is no problem with it. There are already many agents that operate good, sound deposit schemes; at the end of a tenancy the funds are not released to either party until there is agreement between the parties.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>However, I do understand what the Minister said about bad landlords. That is what this is all about. There are bad landlords. I can tell you that there are pretty bad tenants, too. About 30 years ago I once did not take a deposit from a very charming young man who told me that he and his friends were working on an oil rig in the North Sea and they just wanted to have a break for a month or so to occupy a little place that was a subsidiary part of my own home&#151;but detached, so I could not hear any noise. I was fool enough to fall for that. The people moved in. When they left, it turned out that they had been a pop group, high on drugs. They had smashed the chairs into 27 pieces, they had ripped all the lights out of the walls, and they had vomited all over every bit of towel or linen in the place&#151;the bin was full of them. Whatever deposit we had, we could not possibly have made good the damage that they did. That taught me that one should always have some sort of deposit for default and dilapidation. This is the problem.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The Minister said that tenants default in paying their last rent because they are concerned that their deposit will not be returned. I wonder whether that is not a chicken and egg situation&#151;they know that it will not be returned because of what they have done to the place. They default and they know that the landlord is left with nothing, because if they do not pay the last rent, he or she does not have a penny to come back. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield said, it is difficult to get hold of anyone once they have gone. If they want to vanish they can vanish very easily. There may be cause why some tenants do that.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I am told by reliable estate agents that more than 10   per cent of shorthold tenants now fail to pay the last month&#039;s rent. For that reason, I believe that if this deposit scheme is set up, which is a good thing because <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1381"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1381</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it will cover the bad landlords, there should be the option of demanding up to six weeks&#039; rent as a deposit. It would be by agreement between the landlord and the tenant. If it was up to six weeks, then even if they failed to pay the last month the landlord would have at least two weeks&#039; rent, which would go some little way to making up whatever damage they have done. The tenants should not be worried about losing their money, because under this system, it would be secure. But it is quite right that deposits should apply to unpaid rent at the end, as to anything else.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>There have been voluntary schemes in operation and there has been limited take-up, but I am told that those schemes that have been operating have worked quite well. The Minister said that he had considered using more than one scheme. I am not really in favour of that&#151;I think that it is confusing for tenants. It is better to have one scheme, whatever that one scheme is.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>People asked how the tenant would know whether or not the landlord had deposited the money. There is a simple answer to that. When I was on the GLC housing committee, whenever we went out to visit tenants they would say that they had reported problems with their flats three weeks or six months ago and the council would always say that it had had no report. I introduced a system whereby the day the tenants reported their problems they got a little voucher showing that they had reported something wrong on that date. Originally there was great officer objection to that, because they did not want it to be possible to prove that they had done nothing over months. However, they operated it in a pilot scheme and it worked so well that it was introduced universally.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The way for the tenant to be sure that the deposit has been paid is for him to have a copy of the deposit slip. Provided that he is well enough informed to know that such a thing exists and that he is entitled to it&#151;it would be up to the Government and the citizens advice bureaux to see that that happened&#151;no one would be more interested in having that proof positive that the landlord had made the deposit than the tenant himself. That is the way around that one.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The custodial or insurance-based scheme is very complicated and we certainly need to give a lot of thought to how it works. It is important to have it work one way or the other. Small agents, who are often very good with lettings, tell me that if there will be big costs involved, they would have to become members of something in order to be able to pay in these tenants&#039; deposits. That could be a great worry to them, because they do not have a big enough profit margin to continue in business and they would be done out of things by big agents who had big overheads but also big money coming in. That is another important thing.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>As the Minister would know, there is already an exclusion of unreasonable clauses in tenancy agreements, so no one could write into their tenancy agreements something that would counter any reasonable decision made about deposits. There is protection for tenants in that, too.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1382"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1382</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>The Minister referred to non-compliance, which is covered in Amendment No. 222D. He said that the tenant will be owed three times the deposit if the   landlord is at fault. That sounds fine, but if the landlord does not get their rent, will they be allowed twice what they have missed out on? It would be wrong to have a huge penalty one way without some sort of counterbalance the other way. Above all, we want to retain a good system whereby landlords and tenants both benefit from the letting and occupation of a property.

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>The use of independent inventory clerks for check-in and check-out is important. Although the costs have to be shared on these things, each party then has a good, sound basis. Even in Australia, under the New South Wales system, there has to be a full inspection and any faults in the property noted at the time that the tenant moved in, so that no one can claim that they happened during the tenancy.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>This an interesting subject and it is good that it has come forward, but there are lots of issues to discuss, such as that of the untraceable tenant mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and the dispute resolution mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, which also works well in Australia. I hope that we will get more detail.
</p>

<a name="40916-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Finally, the amendment refers to a schedule dealing with the provisions relating to tenancy deposit schemes, and I wonder if the Minister could say which schedule that is or whether it is a schedule that is not yet visible.

<a name="40916-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   I spoke on this issue at Second Reading, and I congratulate the Government on bringing forward these provisions&#151;they are pleasing to see. I would like to pay tribute to the outside agencies that did all the hard work in the background&#151;the CAB, in particular Liz Phelps, who put a lot of work into bringing forward these ideas, Shelter and the Brent Private Tenants Rights Group.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>Before putting the final touches to this, because there is some detail left to deal with, will the Minister convene one or two meetings with those people who have done so much work on it? We need to look carefully at the pilot scheme that this has been based on, and bring in the British Property Federation and others, just to make sure that at the last stages we get the final touches right. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward this important extra part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40916-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I have a number of detailed questions to ask, but first of all I wanted to suggest to the Minister that he and his team might look at eBay for some lessons to be learnt in relation to this scheme. I do not know if the Minister is a regular trader on eBay, but if he is he will know that the way in which one assesses the wisdom or otherwise of trading with a particular person is their record, which is available on eBay, of completed purchases or sales. Every time a person purchases or sells something on eBay, they give feedback as to whether they have been paid properly, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1383"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1383</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the person who has bought reports whether the goods have been received in good condition and promptly. That way a person builds up a record.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>Now, it seems to me that we could do something similar here&#151;we could build up a record for landlords and tenants. A person could look at their landlord, and say, &quot;This landlord regularly repays deposits properly, and things are settled sweetly; he is a good guy to be with&quot;. Alternatively, the landlord could look at a tenant and say, &quot;This tenant has a string of black marks, I am not at all sure that I want him&quot;. It is an enormous incentive to behave properly. Of course someone could avoid it by changing their name or changing their description, but then they have no record, and, after a while, a landlord with no record is going to be someone whom a tenant will treat cautiously.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The system works on eBay. It works astonishingly well&#151;there is a very large business being built on the back of that one idea. I think it would fit very nicely with the scheme and I welcome the scheme as a whole. Can I just ask a few questions about it? What is the Government&#039;s initial impression as to the cost of this? How much will a landlord have to pay per tenancy for the deposit scheme&#151;what is it likely to cost?
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>What are the reasons for not making dispute resolution compulsory or at least making it possible for dispute resolution to be binding, if that is what the particular scheme decides it should be? Obviously, there is an appeal for the court beyond that, but commonly in, say, the building industry, these dispute resolution procedures have a strong binding element and appeals are only possible on limited grounds.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I remember taking that particular scheme through this House. It seems to me that that tends to reduce the problems, particularly when dealing with a difficult landlord or a difficult tenant. The matter can be put into dispute resolution and that is quicker, easier and much more informal than any process held in the courts&#151;particularly if it is a tenant dealing with a difficult landlord. How much will it cost that tenant to go through the court proceedings that will be necessary in order to get back his deposit? In terms of both effort and money, what does it cost?
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>Lastly, it does not seem to me that there are sufficient penalties for a landlord who does not pay the deposit over to the scheme. Someone has to go to court to force him to do so. He has 14 days in which to act. Ultimately, it has cost him nothing; he has just been able to hang on to the deposit for a while and, if the tenant has been active enough to make him pay over the deposit, he will probably have had it for three or four months. So far as I can see, no extra cost penalty is incurred by having failed to pay it over.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>Surely there should be an automatic penalty for not paying over the deposit, which acts as a substantial disincentive to ever doing such a thing. A 100 per cent fine would not seem out of place so that you could be sure that landlords who did this would feel the pain of it and not only when they failed to behave at the end of <br>&nbsp;<br>

the 14-day period. But obviously, along with my noble friend and others, I wait for a later stage to look into this matter in greater detail.

<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40916-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   First, I thank all noble Lords who contributed to the discussion. It lasted longer than I would have expected, although that is probably quite reasonable under the circumstances. A fair amount of information was given from our side of the Dispatch Box on disclosing how the scheme is to work. I thought that we would have more questions on it. I am grateful for the questions that were raised and for the useful contributions. I shall try to deal with them in turn.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, was concerned about the costs of the scheme. The noble Lord, Lord   Lucas, asked how much it would cost per tenant. I cannot give the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, an answer; we do not have an estimate. But, in essence, the scheme should be self-financing, as I said earlier when moving the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>It was also suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Best, that perhaps we needed to finesse some of the detail. I join the noble Lord in paying tribute to the voluntary organisations&#151;in particular, Shelter and NACAB&#151;and the local authorities, which have been very helpful in putting together this set of propositions. Their experience has been valuable.

</p>

<a name="40916-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>We have consulted fairly thoroughly. As I said earlier, we have drawn on two useful pilots, and we consulted on tenancy deposits between November 2002 and February 2003. That was a very useful exercise. We published a full response to the consultation paper, which is available on our departmental website.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>I was asked whether tenancy deposits can be used to offset rent arrears. That makes a great deal of sense. If a tenancy agreement states that, then of course the deposit can be used to offset arrears of rent. I am sure that that will become well established practice.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, asked whether landlords will have to become members in order to use a tenancy deposit scheme. The answer is: no. The custodial scheme at least will be open to anyone without membership. We think that insurance-based schemes are more likely to be used by larger-scale landlords, and I am sure that there will be a benefit in that. We believe that the schemes should be accessible and that the system that we are likely to see adopted will enable that to happen.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether landlords can demand a six-week deposit. There is nothing to stop landlords and tenants agreeing to six-week deposits in terms of these provisions. That should be helpful to landlords who want to ensure&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="40916-23_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I want to correct one point to which the noble Lord replied. My question was not whether landlords had to become members; I was referring to small agents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="40916-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The same response applies. The noble Baroness also asked why there was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1385"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1385</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more than one scheme. Landlords have indicated that they are in favour of insurance-based rather than custodial schemes as they can use the deposits as part of their working capital. The clauses allow for the appointment of a public body to administer one custodial scheme, should there be a problem with multiple schemes.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made an interesting suggestion concerning the use of eBay. My children use eBay and are fascinated by it. I know that we have thought of buying items through eBay and it is a very useful facility. My only thought in response to that is: who would validate the information and how would that work? But it is an interesting thought and certainly one on which we shall reflect.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>The noble Lord also asked why we should not make dispute resolution binding. I suspect that ultimately the court process will have to be used because that will probably give some finality and closure to an extended dispute. But I think that there is value in dispute resolution, and certainly the scheme as I described it this afternoon should provide for the opportunity of dispute resolution as a low-cost alternative to going to court. In the end, it may well be the case that, where parties cannot agree, the courts have to become involved.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I shall give a little more detail on costs. The custodial scheme will be funded from interest on deposits. There will be no extra cost to landlord or tenant. Insurance-based schemes are likely to charge landlords fees&#151;the trade-off for landlords keeping deposits&#151;but there will be no charges to tenants.
</p>

<a name="40916-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>I think that I have covered most of the points. There was one question of fact relating to Schedule 8, to which I referred when speaking to Amendment No. 230B.

<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   Before the Minister sits down, the noble Lord, Lord Best, and I both asked about further consultation with the bodies that have been involved. The noble Lord explained what consultation had been carried out thus far. However, in relation to one or two of the technicalities concerning how the scheme works, it seems clear to me that it would still be worth continuing with those consultations between now and the next stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   We shall obviously continue the consultations. I have given as much detail as I can this afternoon. I appreciate that there will be requests for more information. Of course, we need to work very closely with all parties that have an interest in this matter to ensure that the scheme works most effectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I want to return to the self-financing aspect. I find it a little unrealistic to think that the custodial scheme will be fully financed from interest. All of us who have any money that earns interest find that, even with the present rate, it amounts to nothing. Therefore, I want to go into that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1386"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1386</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a little more or ask the Minister to look into it before the next stage of the Bill. He was not a Member of your Lordships&#039; House when we dealt with a leasehold Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>At that time, we had a Conservative government and it was stated that the scheme would be self-financing. I asked the then government to explain exactly what that meant. There were many different grounds on which one could apply to have one&#039;s lease extended. The reply was that the self-financing aspect would cover everything, even down to the milk for the office cat. That remark caused a sensation in your Lordships&#039; House. Everyone was very worried about it and eventually a ceiling was put on what a private applicant to the leasehold tribunal could be asked to pay, no matter how long the proceedings lasted. Before that, there was a risk that a very rich landlord would drag out the process in order to prevent the leaseholder getting what he wanted.
</p>

<a name="40916-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Therefore, if this scheme is to be self-financing, there should be a clear-cut measure so that people know what is involved. I think that it is a little on the doubtful side to assume that the scheme will be financed by interest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   That is a fair point. The noble Baroness is right, I was not a Member of the House during those Conservative days. I could make a cheap jibe about Conservative promises, but that would be unfair of me. Perhaps we should return with some illustrative figures at the next stage which may help to provide a measure of reassurance. I too would be interested in them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I was the Minister at the time who made that remark. I can tell my noble friend that I was extremely glad that she fought on that and eventually won. We had been hobbled by the Treasury into saying that the matter would be self-financing. It was her and her colleagues&#039; efforts that enabled us to achieve what we wanted in our discussions with the Treasury. I am sure that subterfuge is not unknown to the Benches opposite. It gave pleasure at the time anyway. Thank you.
</p>

<a name="40916-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I would appreciate the Minister writing to me on three matters. First, he said he did not have an estimate of the cost of the scheme, but he has run two pilots so he must have some idea. Perhaps he can let me know roughly where we are on that.
</p>

<a name="40916-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Secondly, the Minister&#039;s ministry runs a dispute resolution scheme in the construction sector which was put in place when I occupied his position. That has a strong element of binding about it. Will the Minister talk to colleagues involved in that and write to me saying why, in this case, binding is not appropriate? It was a fairly fractious sector and disputes were common and protracted. It appeared that binding was appropriate in those cases and I would very much like to know why we are not following that precedent now. There may be good reasons, but I would like an explanation.
</p>

<a name="40916-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Finally, he did not answer my question about why there is no real penalty on a landlord who does not pay over the deposit straightaway. Why, when one has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1387"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1387</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taken a landlord through the courts, does he not simply have to do what he should have done in the first place without paying a penalty for having misbehaved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I apologise to the noble Lord for that last point. I had made a note of the question. It is probably best if I write to the noble Lord on all three points. The second point about binding is a valuable one. We may be able to draw on the earlier experience of the noble Lord. I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, that we would try to return with some illustrative costs to help all concerned. I shall put that in correspondence, which will be shared with all noble Lords who have participated in the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40916-24_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   On the matter of binding, will the Minister and his officials look at the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal explaining why alternative dispute resolution procedures cannot easily be treated as binding without being inimical to the purpose of the scheme itself? I believe that needs to be looked at too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>

<p><a name="st_195"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is not about the restoration of a statutory duty, as in the Caravan Sites Act 1968, where local authorities were obliged to provide accommodation for all Gypsies residing or resorting to their area, but simply seeks to provide that they exercise their powers under the 1960 Act so far as may be necessary to provide the sites themselves or to facilitate the provision of adequate and suitable accommodation for the needs of Gypsies and Travellers. I shall explain that this is not nearly as onerous a duty as it was in the 1968 Act.

</p>

<a name="40916-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>The Government have wisely decided that the accommodation needs of Gypsies should be dealt with from 2005 onwards as part of the process of housing needs assessment, as Keith Hill told the ODPM Select Committee on 13 July. Therefore, it is useful to see how planning and housing policies for Gypsies will fit together. The assessments by local housing authorities, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1390"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1390</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which have to be conducted in accordance with the methodology that is laid down in the revised ODPM guidance now being developed by the University of Cambridge, and quality assured by the regional housing boards, will be aggregated into the regional spatial strategy and that will indicate the number of pitches required over a five-year period in the area of each authority. So under this framework we can assume that there will be sufficient land specified in local development documents to meet the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>For the first time, presumably, we shall know something about the transfers of Gypsy and Traveller families into and out of settled accommodation because that will be an obvious part of the needs assessment. In many of these debates, there is an unspoken assumption that Gypsies are permanently immured on their caravan sites, but the reality is that a large number of Gypsy families already live in housing and there is some movement in both directions.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>For the past five years, ever since Chris Mullin was the responsible Minister at the DETR, I have tried to persuade the Government to get local authorities to record such movements. We need to know more about the preferences of these communities and to offer them the same variety of choices, including ordinary housing and group housing, pioneered in the Republic of Ireland but ignored by the ODPM, as are available to people who live in settled accommodation.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>The majority of Gypsies and Travellers would like to continue living a traditional way of life, although about 80 per cent of them want to stay on one site, either out of choice or necessity. As there is a shortage of some 4,000 pitches in England, a family that gains a pitch on a permanent site tends to stick to it, even if their inclination is still to travel.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>The question is who will develop the sites that are needed. It was clear from the replies given by Mr Hill in evidence to the ODPM Select Committee on 13 July that he was thinking that the vast majority of travellers would provide their own sites and that registered social landlords would come in only as an afterthought. He said that placing a duty on local authorities,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;would put Gypsies and Travellers arguably in an advantageous position by comparison with other local residents with housing needs . . .  the introduction of the duty does not really sit comfortably with our policy of expanding areas of choice, discretion and decision making amongst local authorities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>There is plenty of evidence to show that Gypsies want to develop their own sites in the form of the increasing number of planning applications and appeals by people from the Gypsy community. In the year to 31 March 2004, Gypsies lodged 118 appeals against refusal of planning permissions of which they won 49. However, many of those were for temporary permissions, according to Dr Donald Kenrick, to whom I am indebted for the figures and with whose work I believe the department is familiar. I believe that it has been acknowledged that he is the foremost expert on the matter in the country. Dr Kenrick points out that if private sites were gained at the rate experienced in 2003, it would take 27 years for enough to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1391"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1391</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provided to those living on unauthorised sites and that is without making any allowance for new household formations in the Gypsy community.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Most of the refusals were because the land is in unsuitable locations, such as green belt, as was shown in &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot;, the week before last. That programme also demonstrated that the applicants have no choice. There is a long queue for places on even the most appalling public sites&#151;under motorways or next to sewage farms&#151;and the alternative is a periodic struggle against the bailiffs and the police. There are few willing sellers of land. However, if vendors could have obtained planning permission for some more profitable form of development, they would not have sold the land to Gypsies.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>The transactions tend to reflect that lack of apparent development potential. When the new planning system is in force, and land is designated as suitable for a Gypsy site, presumably its value will be that much greater and correspondingly fewer Gypsies will have the resources to buy the land. I put that point in a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, on 20 July, but I gather that the letter went astray. I have only recently re-sent it, so I am not blaming him for not having yet replied. The matter needs careful consideration.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>Gypsies may be able to get planning consent more readily under the new regime, but will probably have to pay a lot more for it; indeed, some will be priced out of the market. The Minister may say that is no different from the situation of low-income house dwellers who cannot afford to buy their own properties, but in their case there are other options available: privately rented accommodation, or housing provided by registered social landlords. Neither of those agencies will deal with Gypsies.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>The Novas Ouvertures group would like to develop sites and group housing and may well make some contribution; however, there are no other RSLs queuing up to offer their services, and no private landlords on the horizon either. That is why, for low-income families&#151;hundreds of them now statutorily homeless&#151;the duty of local authorities to provide or facilitate embodied in this amendment is so essential.

</p>

<a name="40916-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>The Minister said, in his reply to question 321 in the ODPM Select Committee, that the amendment would have &quot;significant spending implications&quot;. However, if he is right in thinking that nearly all Gypsies would prefer to own their own site, and they have the money and they can get planning permission, the demand for new pitches on local authority sites would be modest. Last January, there were 3,700 caravans on unauthorised sites. If only 10 per cent of them cannot afford to buy land and develop it as a site of their own, the local authorities would only need to provide 20 new sites in the whole of England, the cost of which might possibly amount to 0.1 per cent of the ODPM&#039;s budget, even if all the sites were provided in one year. Against that could be set the considerable cost of evictions, which would then be a thing of the past. It took 40 bailiffs from Gypsy and squatter eviction specialists Constant and Co. to evict <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1392"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1392</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Gypsies from the Bulkington site in Warwickshire in June, at an estimated cost of &#163;150,000, one of a number of evictions on a similar scale so far this year.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>If there is to be no duty to provide, how does the ODPM expect local authorities to meet their obligations to Gypsies under the Homelessness Act 2002? As the noble Lord knows, a Gypsy family is homeless under the Housing Act 1996 if their caravan is on an unauthorised site and there is nowhere they are entitled to put it. The Homelessness Act 2002 requires local authorities to ensure that sufficient accommodation is available for people who may become homeless in their area. If, as the courts have decided, Gypsies with a cultural aversion to bricks and mortar cannot be put into bed and breakfasts would they not have to commission more sites in order to comply with the law?
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I realise that all those matters will become clearer when the ODPM publishes the outcome of its review that has been going on since early this year, and that the noble Lord may not be in a position to say much this afternoon. We are told that that outcome is not likely to appear before mid-October&#151;in fact, roughly at the same time as the Select Committee on the ODPM publishes its own report.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Another matter of great importance arises out of discussion in the ODPM Select Committee in the consultations the ODPM has undertaken: the question of the definition of &quot;Gypsies and Travellers&quot; that has to be drafted to replace the existing one in the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. There, Gypsies&#151;then spelt &quot;gipsies&quot;, with a small &quot;g&quot;&#151;were defined as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>That, however, urgently needs to be updated.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>First, as already noted, most Gypsies and Travellers are no longer nomadic. Secondly, the courts have decided, in the case of Berry, that a person who gives up travelling, for whatever reason, ceases to be a Gypsy. If that were to be applied strictly, any family allocated a pitch on a local authority Gypsy site would cease to be entitled to live there if it were known that they had decided to stay there permanently. The same would apply to an Irish Traveller in a similar position.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>Gypsies and Irish Travellers are minorities, recognised as such for the purposes of race relations registration. Their separate needs for health and education services, for example, as well as for accommodation, have to be dealt with so as to secure their equality with other sections of the community under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Court of Appeal&#039;s decision in the Berry case has to be corrected while the opportunity is before the House.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>We therefore define &quot;Gypsies&quot; in the new clause by their ethnicity, making no distinction between those who still keep to their ancient way of life and those who decide to settle down permanently, whether on a site or in bricks and mortar. Travellers can be either Irish Travellers, to whom the same reasoning applies, members of other ethnic groups for whom living in a caravan is part of their traditional way of life, or, as before, persons of a nomadic habit of life.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1393"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1393</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>The definition would not increase the number of families wishing to live on Gypsy caravan sites. We believe there are very few families now settled in housing who would seek to revert to living in caravans if that were made easier for them than at present, and they would be counterbalanced by an equal number of families moving in the opposite direction. If more Gypsies living in houses did want to move on to the sites, and vice versa, that much housing would be released for the benefit of other applicants. I know the ODPM&#039;s concern with a statutory duty is mainly on the grounds of cost, and I hope these arguments will help to alleviate that anxiety.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>I welcome the review of Gypsy policy that has been conducted by the ODPM, including the consultations at a number of seminars in the spring. I attended one in Derbyshire, and I think the ODPM found it useful as a means of exploring the main issues and ascertaining the latest views of stakeholders. In addition, I had a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the then Minister, at the beginning of March, and I am sure your Lordships would like to join me in sending our best wishes to Ms Cooper on the recent birth of her daughter, which has meant that her duties have been taken over for the time being by Mr Keith Hill.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>I sent a 3,000-word memorandum to Ms Cooper, a couple of days after I met her in March, covering the main points raised, as well as supplementary letters on 6 and 27 March, covering the problems of definition that I have just discussed, and reviewing the Wrexham and Basildon cases. At that time, it was expected that the outcome of the review would be published in July, as Ms Cooper herself had said tentatively at the launch of the IPPR paper on Gypsy policy in January. However, the date has slipped for the second time, now that Keith Hill has appeared before the Select Committee.
</p>

<a name="40916-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>I understand that the ODPM may not want to risk criticism by publishing the outcome of its review before the Select Committee reports in mid-October, but, like everybody else who has looked at the subject recently, the ODPM Select Committee is almost certain to recommend the restoration of a statutory duty in some form. As that is the policy of not only the Select Committee but also of the National Farmers Union, the Local Government Association and the other authorities who have looked into the matter, I hope at least we shall have some encouragement from the Minister this afternoon that the statutory duty in the form outlined in this proposed new clause will be restored. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>I want to concentrate on one thing in support of this amendment: the need to give effect to the important judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Connors and the United Kingdom&#151;
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="40916-26_time0"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My noble friend is speaking on the subject of the next amendment, on which I had asked for a separate debate. Although the two amendments were grouped together originally, I thought that the Connors<i> </i>judgment was sufficiently important to be dealt with separately from the issue of site provision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I apologise; I thought that the amendments had been grouped together.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   I, too, support the amendment. Over the years we have failed, centrally and locally, to provide for the accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities. As we know, this has led to such problems as the illegal development of sites and unauthorised encampments. It has had a   negative effect on many settled residential communities, leading to bad community relations, hostility and local conflict. Consequently, it has also become increasingly difficult for Travellers to gain access to the most basic services, particularly health and education. However, I have been impressed by recent initiatives taken by the Department for Education and Skills in the education of Travellers&#039; children.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>The amendment asks the Government to consider the accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller community. To my mind, it offers the best way to do it: to lay a duty on local authorities. The provision of adequate sites&#151;public and private, residential and transit&#151;would address a number of the main problems. It would address the acute shortage of sites and would bring to an end illegal developments, unauthorised encampments and much local frustration, conflict and hostility.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The concerns of settled communities, represented by local councils, parish councils, residents&#039; associations and the like, in which those new sites are to be located, must be considered to allay the obvious fears and anxieties. But to accept the amendment would significantly raise the level of social inclusion of Travellers, and I suggest that such positive action is well overdue. Only such provision will eliminate the need for unauthorised sites and will go a considerable way to enabling settled residential communities and Travellers and Gypsies to live side by side in harmony with each other.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We need to find a solution that will benefit Travellers and local residential communities. We need to give Travellers proper sites, with the same status as housing, so that they can be assessed and developed in the same way. Could we not allow Housing Corporation money to be used to help local authorities to provide and facilitate such sites? We can no longer live in the fond <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1395"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1395</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hope that somehow a magical solution to this difficult problem will be found. We need a satisfactory solution for the benefit of Travellers and local residential communities, and I believe that this amendment does just that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </b>   I support the aims and objectives of the amendment. Having served as the leader of a council and as a Member of Parliament dealing with constituency problems, I am not unaware of the delicacy and intricacies involved in this matter. I shall listen carefully to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Will the Minister tell us precisely why the law was changed to lift the obligation? That is the kernel of the problem. I am under no illusion, and nor will the Minister and his advisers be, that the problem will not be solved overnight or easily. The resources of every local authority are probably under strain, yet we will be asking them to find a site or sites adequate to provide for Travellers. It will not be easy, but we must start somewhere.

</p>

<a name="40916-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The Minister may tell us that discussions and negotiations are ongoing. The Traveller community is entitled to have its problem dealt with, not once and for all, but so that it is appreciated that they are regarded as a distinct segment of the community. At the same time, the opportunity will be given to remind the Traveller community that they have responsibilities and are obligated to act as normal citizens provided that they are treated as such.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>If this amendment and the series of amendments related to it do not start the debate, I hope that they will result in continued discussion of this vexed issue. From a local council perspective, the phrase &quot;Not in my back yard&quot; comes readily to mind. Most people will want a resolution of the problem, so goodwill and diplomacy will be required from all stakeholders. I hope that the Minister can help us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Whitaker: </b>   I, too, would like to add my support to the amendments, which stand also in my name, and to convey the regrets of my noble friend Lady Dean and the noble Lord, Lord Ouseley, who, because of the rescheduling of the Bill, were unable to come, as they had hoped, to speak to it.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>We all felt that Gypsies and Travellers are in a uniquely disadvantaged position in lawfully finding somewhere suitable to their needs to live. It is no surprise that there is a general acknowledgement, not least by the Government, that changes need to be made.

<a name="40916-26_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I add my support to the amendment. The conflict between the nomadic and the settled exists all over the world and stretches back, I suspect, to the advent of the first farmer. There will be no end to the potential for tension. I am well aware that all around the country, wherever the two communities come into proximity, there is the potential for flare-ups. In many cases, flare-ups have occurred, and they cause a great deal of emotion. But we should look at such matters from a background of liberty and tolerance, and <br>&nbsp;<br>

recognise that we must facilitate people&#039;s right to pursue another way of life, so long as they exist within reasonable norms, as the noble Lord, Lord Graham, says.

</p>

<a name="40916-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>I and many of my colleagues should feel particularly sympathetic towards Gypsies when we are in the process of having part of our way of life crushed by the majority. We should understand what it feels like to have the basis of one&#039;s existence denied by the majority. We should therefore feel notably sympathetic towards making sure that other people get what we would like to have, if I can put it that way. It is a case of &quot;do as we would be done by&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I welcome the amendment. Having been a councillor both pre-1994 and post-1994, I think that the amendment is particularly important. Before the repeal of the duty, councils felt able to be proactive; after the repeal, it was only the very brave councils which felt that they could enact Circular 1/94, and were often taken to task by their residents, who saw neighbouring councils doing nothing, as they were able to do. So I would welcome a duty being reimposed.

</p>

<a name="40916-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>I particularly welcome proposed subsection (2) in which one local authority can call on the help of another. Too often, that help has not been forthcoming. If all three tiers of local government can work together, it will help.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Should the new clause be accepted, I hope that the experience of those who have tried to continue to provide sites will be understood. From what I have observed, small sites work very much better. I hope that if this duty is given again to local authorities, there will be guidance to the effect that one large site does not work well. Although it is harder because more local communities have to be addressed, the provision of several small sites across an authority seems to work very much better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="40916-26_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I do not want to pour cold water on the unusual unanimity in the House. However, having dealt with this matter as a former leader of a council, I need to raise one or two areas of concern.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has said that this duty is not really a duty. I do not quite understand that. In legislation, as I understand it, a duty requires you to do something and there do not seem to be very many ways around that. Perhaps he would be kind enough to explain that again when he responds to the debate.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I have concerns about the inclusion within this of metropolitan districts and London boroughs. London boroughs, particularly those in inner London, found this burden almost impossible to bear under the previous legislation. It is a very major duty and one which in many cases is simply not achievable. Proposed subsection (2) would not help, because when one authority has finally managed to find land that is appropriate, it will not be terribly keen on providing it for others. In my borough in London, we co-operate and combine on this matter with the borough next <br>&nbsp;<br>

door to provide sites. I am bound to say that if we had to do it again, we would be seriously pushed to be able to provide these facilities.
</p>

<a name="40916-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>I do not think that we will be able to waft this through on the basis that it will be absolutely fine. It will not be fine in metropolitan areas and London borough areas. If the noble Lord pursues this measure, we would have to oppose that aspect of the legislation.

<a name="40916-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As noble Lords will know, I and my noble friend Lord Rooker have a great deal of sympathy with not only the new clause but also the cause that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has so assiduously pursued, certainly in my time in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>I am certainly in agreement with the idea that adequate provision should be made for Gypsies and Travellers. My local government experience showed me the folly of not doing that. As a product of my time as a leader of an authority that had a lot of green land around it, I also became very aware of some of the problems that are associated with Traveller encampments, and so on.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>Failures in the past have made it much harder for Gypsies and Travellers to have easy access to education, healthcare, employment and to take benefit from the other range of facilities which exist and should be on offer through the public service. I also agree that local authorities should work together and each make a fair contribution to meeting need. There should be a way of ensuring that need, where it is identified, is met to the same extent as housing need. However, I do not agree that imposing a new duty is necessarily the best way forward.

</p>

<a name="40916-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>My noble friend Lord Graham asked why the law was changed. I cannot speculate on the thinking behind the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, but it   was part of an approach adopted by the then government, who held that the Caravan Sites Act 1968 was no longer effective. Although I regretted the Act&#039;s demise at the time, the then government had a point. Only 38 per cent of councils had met their obligations under the 1968 duty. Statistics suggest that unauthorised encampments fell by just 1 per cent as a result of the change in the law. The supposition behind the legislation was that Gypsies and Travellers would buy their own land, aided by Circular 1/94, which probably has not worked as well as some enthusiasts for it thought that it might.

<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>However, we need to move on. If the past duty is no longer seen as an effective way forward, other measures should clearly be taken. The previous duty did not result in the universal, high-quality and appropriate provision that modern standards suggest should be there. A duty that relates only to Gypsies and Travellers rather suggests that they should remain, as they have been for so long, outside the system. It perpetuates the idea that they are different and separate. Imposing a duty would be accepting that local authorities should not have to meet Gypsy and Traveller needs through the same mechanisms as they meet the needs of the rest of the community. I do not accept that. The only way to <br>&nbsp;<br>

ensure long-term, sustainable and high-quality provision for Gypsies and Travellers is to bring them within the systems that already exist and to provide them with a greater measure of equality in those systems.

<a name="40916-27_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>That should happen through the new planning system. Noble Lords who were present will recall that during discussions on the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, my noble friend Lord Rooker and I were sympathetic to the pressure that was understandably brought to bear by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, my noble friend Lady Whitaker and others. That Act will   ensure that Gypsy and Traveller needs will be mainstreamed in the housing and planning systems, along with the needs of the rest of the community. Local authorities will work with regional housing boards to ensure that local and regional needs are met within the system. That will avoid the bureaucracy and conflict that would be likely to arise if local authorities were legally bound to assist other local authorities or to show why they could not, as is suggested by the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>It is of course essential that, in the process of mainstreaming, Gypsies and Travellers do not get lost among all the other groups competing for resources. Local authorities will need to think and act strategically in relation to Gypsy and Traveller needs, and they must accept their responsibilities willingly towards that often marginalised group.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has added to the amendment and to Amendment No. 225 a definition of &quot;Gypsies&quot; and &quot;Travellers&quot;. All I can usefully say in response is that that is one of the issues on which we are due to report. The noble Lord&#039;s draft is interesting and appears to have value, but it would be premature to pursue that element of his amendment until the report is introduced. I cannot give him an exact date on which that report will be produced. I regret that it has been delayed, but I am sure that it has been delayed for good reason and that it will be important document of policy.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>I certainly sympathise with what has been said, but there are problems with the suggested approach. The Government have put more resources, effort and intellectual thought into dealing with such problems than previous governments, because we recognise that Gypsies and Travellers have suffered and have been marginalised. We want to try to embrace their needs and bring them within the systems that provide decent-quality public services for all. While we understand the point of view of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, our approach is probably better suited in the long term to matching their needs and aspirations.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I thank all noble Lords who have supported the amendment. That includes every noble Lord or Baroness who has spoken, with the partial exception of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, who poured cold water on the idea that the duty to provide for Gypsies and Travellers should be imposed on <br>&nbsp;<br>

London and metropolitan boroughs in the same way as it is on local authorities elsewhere. To recap what was said by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, this is a win-win situation between the Travellers and the settled community. If we can solve this problem, if we can get sites, then it will assist the Gypsies and, as the right reverend Prelate correctly observed, eliminate the nuisance we have up and down the country. 
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is well aware of this from the number of Members of another place who have raised the matter in adjournment debates. For example, the other day I spoke to Mr Paice, who represents the area of Cottenham, where there is a very large, unauthorised encampment. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, may be interested to know that we had the Cottenham Residents&#039; Association and the Gypsies speaking together in amicable terms at the meeting of the Traveller Law Reform Parliamentary Group. They agreed that this was the right way forward, that there should be a duty on local authorities to provide sites and that that would enable unauthorised encampments, such as we have at Cottenham and in the village of Minety, which was dealt with in Trevor MacDonald&#039;s programme, to which I have already referred, to be eliminated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="40916-27_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Goschen: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I was extremely interested in the last point he made. It is the key to the whole issue. Will he expand a bit further on why he is so confident that all Travellers&#151;a notably independent-minded group of people&#151;would use sites officially approved by an authority, if they were provided, rather than those of their own choice? As the noble Lord has said, &quot;Gypsies and Travellers&quot; encompasses a broad group of people from traditional Roma to those who fancy the urge to go to a pop concert and want to claim that they are nomads who have come to rest in a farmer&#039;s field, where they cause serious problems. If the noble Lord has a solution to this very difficult problem&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Graham, was right to point out to us that it is difficult&#151;he would receive a great deal of support. But at the moment, I do not understand why he is so confident that that would be the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="40916-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I shall be delighted to answer the noble Viscount&#039;s question and at the same time address the point that was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. A large number of Gypsies do provide their own sites and this is the way in which most of the Gypsy community would like to go. But they have not been able to do so because Circular 1/94 did not encourage local authorities to provide the necessary planning permissions, as had been hoped. This is why Gypsies are buying pieces of land in unsuitable locations up and down the country and then applying for planning permission, going all the way through the appeal system and coming into conflict with local residents.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>I am suggesting&#151;this is the answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;that if, say, 80 per cent of Gypsies wish to develop their own sites, have the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1400"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1400</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

means to do so and can get the planning permission&#151;which they ought to be able to do under the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act because land will be designated for that purpose&#151;there will still be a residue of perhaps 20 per cent of the Gypsy and Traveller population who do not have the means or the skills to go through the planning system, to get their own sites and to develop them. I entirely agree with my noble friend who said that smaller sites are much better than the larger ones. I hope that local authorities will take that into consideration in planning for the needs of Travellers, as they will have to do in 2005 onwards as part of the housing needs assessment.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>But what are we to do with the 20 per cent who are not able to afford their own sites? This is what I was asking the Minister to address and he said nothing about it. We will have to wait and see what the ODPM survey suggests should be done about those people.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 will be a major step forward, because there will then be within each local authority a definite number of sites and pitches that will have to be divided, in the same way as the local authorities provide for housing. But it is not said who is going to give those sites. The majority will be dealt with by the Gypsies themselves and a few may be provided by registered social landlords; but a small minority of people will not be able to afford, or do not have the skills, to go through the system as has been outlined. What we suggest is that local authorities should have a duty, as necessary, to provide or facilitate for that small minority.
</p>

<a name="40916-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>I said that I did not expect to reach a solution this afternoon, because a survey is being undertaken by the ODPM and the Select Committee has to report, which will happen in October. I hope that by the time we come back to the matter on Report we shall have both documents. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>After Clause 186, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_24"></a><br>
   &quot;PROTECTED SITES FOR GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS

<br>
(1)   In section 5(1) of the Mobile Homes Act 1983 (c. 34) (interpretation) for &quot;protected site&quot; substitute the following definition&#151;


<br>
&quot;&quot;protected site&quot; has the same meaning as in Part 1 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (c. 52) except that it also includes any Gypsy and Traveller site owned or managed by a county council or a district council.&quot; 


<br>
(2)   In section 5(5) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (c. 52) (supplementary) for &quot;shall not apply&quot; substitute &quot;applies&quot;.


<br>
(3)   Section 4(6)(a) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (provision for suspension of eviction orders) is repealed.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_210"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment seeks to give effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of <i>Connors</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i>, about which I wrote to the Minister on 29 May. It puts Gypsies on the same footing as others <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1401</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as regards security of tenure by reading across to Gypsy sites the relevant provisions of the Mobile Homes Act 1983.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Briefly, Mr James Connors, a Gypsy, had been resident on the Cottingley Springs caravan site for some 15 years, apart from the short interval in 1977, when he and his family were summarily evicted, on 1 August 2000, in a five-hour operation involving police and bailiffs. The county court granted the council possession on the grounds that the family were trespassers, their permission to occupy the land having been withdrawn. From then onwards, Mr Connors and his two elder boys, Charles and Michael, who were aged 14 and 13, moved around the area in one of their caravans, staying only a couple of weeks in any one place before being moved on, while Mrs Connors separated from her husband and moved into a house with the younger children&#151;Daniel, 10, and Thomas, four months.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The central issue in the case was whether, in the circumstances, the legal framework applicable to the occupation of pitches on local authority Gypsy sites provided the applicant, Mr Connors, with sufficient procedural protection of his rights. The court was not satisfied that local authorities needed the flexibility allowed by the power of summary eviction in order to cope with a nomadic clientele&#151;bearing in mind that according to the Niner report, as I have already mentioned, 86 per cent of Gypsies remained on the same site for three or more years.

</p>

<a name="40916-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>The court was not satisfied that there was any particular feature of local authority Gypsy sites that would render their management unworkable if they were required to establish reasons for evicting long-standing occupants. Analysing the absence of procedural safeguards, the court dismissed the Government&#039;s argument that judicial review was adequate for the purpose, because it could not provide an opportunity for examining the facts in dispute between the parties.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>In fact, since the local authority was not required to show any substantive justification for evicting a Gypsy from one of its own sites, there was never an opportunity for any judicial consideration of the facts that led to the eviction. The court therefore found that the eviction of Mr Connors and his family was not attended by the   necessary procedural safeguards&#151;namely, the requirement to establish proper justification for the serious interference to his right to family life, and could not be regarded as justified by a pressing social need or proportionate to a legitimate aim being pursued.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>In his response of 6 August to the letter that I wrote on 29 May, Mr Hill apologised for the long delay, but all he said was that security of tenure was being considered as part of the ODPM&#039;s policy review. If the review recommended a change in the legislation, the matter would be referred to the Law Commission&#039;s tenure review which is expected to produce its findings, together with a draft Bill, towards the end of the year.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>In fact, the Law Commission&#039;s website says that it hopes to publish its final report with a draft Bill in early 2005. That means that with the general election approaching there will probably not be time for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1402"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1402</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Parliament to consider such a Bill in the next Session, which may be shorter than usual and is likely to concentrate on matters considered more attractive to the electorate.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The summary eviction powers that the European Court declared were a breach of Article 8 would then remain in force for at least 18 months after the judgment; in spite of the fact that a convenient opportunity to eliminate them in the shape of the amendment is being offered to the Government now. That would not be in accordance with the spirit of our adherence to the convention. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I apologise for the fact that I spoke in support of the wrong amendment, even though I supported it. I had not realised that the amendments had been degrouped because of the importance of considering each one separately. Lawyers are terrible at matters of procedure, especially this lawyer. However, I was able to pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Avebury and I do not need to repeat what I said.

</p>

<a name="40916-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>I would like to concentrate on the obligations on the United Kingdom to give effect to the landmark judgment of the First Chamber of the European Court, which included the British judge Sir Nicholas Bratza. The decision was unanimous. The Government wisely decided not to challenge the decision by seeking to refer it to the Grand Chamber of the court.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>We have here a final and binding judgment as of 27   May. The Government have six months in order to report to the enforcement mechanism under the European Convention&#151;that is, the Committee Ministers of the Council of Europe&#151;on what they propose to do in order to give effect to the judgment.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>That does not mean only satisfying judgments in terms of some &#163;30,000 in compensation, legal fees and expenses that the taxpayer will have to pay to satisfy the judgment in respect of the individual; it means also putting right the systemic failure so that other Gypsies in similar circumstances do not have to retain lawyers and bring legal proceedings in this country and then before the European Court of Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>I know that the Government are likely to say that they will not tell the Committee what they propose to do until they have told the Committee of Ministers, which they will probably not do until 27 November, which will be after the Bill has left the House and we lose any control or influence over the matter. I very much hope that that will not be the Minister&#039;s response today for the following reasons.

</p>

<a name="40916-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>The Bill provides a perfect opportunity to implement the court&#039;s judgment with a simple amendment&#151;I congratulate my noble friend and the Commission for Racial Equality, which authored the amendment. It is a simple way of putting right the systemic ether. It does not require the Law Commission, a possible draft Bill and a further delay&#151;as my noble friend said&#151;of 18 months or even longer to put the matter right.

<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>It would be extremely unfortunate if other victims had to go to British courts and the Strasbourg court completely unnecessarily in order to obtain a remedy in the long term when it is Parliament&#039;s job as well as the Government&#039;s to comply with the obligations imposed on the United Kingdom by being party to the convention. I have a number of questions for the Minister; if he cannot reply to them today we shall return to the matter on Report. What is being said in this debate, and will be said in the debates on the remaining stages of the Bill, will undoubtedly be scrutinised carefully in Strasbourg by those responsible under the enforcement mechanisms. Therefore, it is not a complete waste of breath for us to debate this measure carefully at this stage and to seek answers from the Government.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>As the Joint Committee on Human Rights, to which I belong, will not meet again until 13 October&#151;which I believe is the contemplated date for the Report stage&#151;it will not be able to do its normal scrutinising job in time to influence what happens on Report, although I hope that certainly by Third Reading we can have the benefit of the committee&#039;s considerations.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>I should like to ask the Minister the following questions. First, have the Government approached the Law Commission to ask it to consider urgently what needs to be done in order to implement the judgment, as it plainly is urgent? If not, will they do so very soon, if the Law Commission is to be involved, although I do not see why it needs to be?
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Secondly, will the Minister confirm that the Government have an obligation under the European Convention to introduce general measures to prevent future violations in similar cases? I should have thought that must be an easy thing to answer as it is obvious.
</p>

<a name="40916-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>Thirdly, does the Minister agree that it is important for the Government to avoid the need for further unnecessary litigation by making the necessary changes? Finally&#151;this is the most important question of all&#151;will the Minister explain why this amendment is not tailor-made and fit for the purpose of providing a proper remedy for the systemic failures that my noble friend has already explained, and that are explained fully in the important judgment of the European Court? I very much hope that that final question can be answered today because it is the most important one at the moment as regards determining whether this amendment should have our support.

<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40916-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   This clause seeks to widen the definition of a &quot;protected site&quot; in the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to include local authority-owned and/or managed Gypsy and Traveller sites to give security of tenure to residents; to extend the Protection From Eviction Act 1977 to those occupying caravan sites as a residence; and also seeks to give courts the power to suspend an eviction order against a resident of a local authority site.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>We have been looking at the issue of tenure on local authority sites in detail in our policy review. It is clear that security of tenure for Gypsies and Travellers is out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1404"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1404</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of line with that for both conventional housing and park homes. The original justification for this&#151;that the level of security of tenure for Gypsies and Travellers was appropriate to facilitate nomadism&#151;has much less force now than it had in the past. However, in this debate a number of Members of the Committee made the point that in some ways Gypsies constitute much more settled communities now than they have done for many, many years.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>In terms of type of resident, type of landlord and management needs, local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites share characteristics with social housing. Of course, the legislation that underpins them is different, and a great deal of further consideration would need to be given to how public sites might be brought more into line with social housing. Such a task is not possible within the timescales of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>Furthermore, amending the Mobile Homes Act in the way suggested would have wider consequences. It would confer succession rights to the occupation agreement, allow residents to assign their occupation agreement to others, and allow local authorities to charge commission on the sale of caravans. This is another reason why the amendment is unsuitable.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>Subsection (2) of this amendment is not necessary in relation to those on protected sites under the Caravan Sites Act 1968, which includes all those on local authority-owned sites&#151;apart from those on county council-owned sites&#151;as this effect is already achieved by Clause 186 of the Bill. Clause 186 extends protection from harassment and unlawful eviction to those occupying caravans as a residence on a protected site. Section 3 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, once amended by Clause 186, will offer equivalent and equal protection to those occupying caravans on a protected site as is offered to those occupying conventional housing by the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>I am aware, however, that there is a disparity between the status of sites owned by district councils and those owned by county councils. The former are protected sites under the Caravan Sites Act 1968, and the latter are not. We are currently considering this issue further.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>Subsection (3) of the amendment seeks to give courts the power to suspend eviction orders made against residents of local authority-owned sites. The amendment is drafted widely, as it would allow courts to suspend eviction orders in all cases where the sites were owned by a local authority, not just Gypsy and Traveller sites. However, I am happy to give this amendment some further consideration and, if appropriate, return to it on Report.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, asked a number of questions, and I will try and respond to them as best I can. The first question he asked was whether we have approached the Law Commission. No, we have not as yet, in dealing with the specifics of the case. We need to be clear about exactly what we want. Security of tenure is obviously a complex issue and, as I think I have said already, a detailed review of that is continuing.

<a name="40916-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>The second question the noble Lord asked was whether we are putting things in place to correct systemic problems. I think that is a very fair question. We will consider this again but, as I have said, it is not as straightforward as the noble Lord would perhaps like to assume. But we will look at this very carefully, because clearly this is part of the continuing review we have been undertaking.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The third question related to the need to avoid litigation. Of course we agree. Yes, that is absolutely desirable. But we do want to get it right, and that is why we want to look at the social rented sector, as I said earlier in my contribution, as a comparator. I think the fourth question was probably covered in what I said earlier.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>We recognise the scale of the difficulty that the court case in particular has created. It has highlighted some very important issues. We are happy to look at elements of the amendment, because we can see there is merit in it. But we want a period of further reflection, and I think it would be useful if the noble Lord, Lord   Lester, would enable us to give this some further thought and come back on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40916-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am extremely grateful for the helpful and encouraging answers to my questions. I think I am right in interpreting what the Minister has said in this way: we can hope that on Report, before this Bill leaves this House, we will have an opportunity for considering another way of implementing the judgment, which will avoid, perhaps, the need for 18 months of delay with the Law Commission and further legislation. That is one very important thing. As I understand the Minister, he is indicating that that is his hope, and we, and the Government, could therefore do our job in Parliament in implementing the judgment before the end of the Session. Have I understood him correctly?

I am certainly going to ensure that we address the issues that have been raised this afternoon. Whether we manage to come back with a perfected solution within the current Session is an open question. As I said, there are elements of the amendment that we want to give some further consideration to, which may go some way to meeting some of the problems that have been highlighted by the Connors case. So I know that that has qualified, perhaps, the noble Lord&#039;s rather more enthusiastic interpretation of what I said. But I do not want to mislead the Committee, and it would be quite wrong and improper of me to do so.

<a name="40916-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>Thirdly, bearing in mind that only the first day of Report is on 13 October, my noble friend would be able to consider the matter in the Joint Committee on Human Rights on that day and still be in time for recommendations to be made to the House that could be considered when we returned to the matter on Report. With those three conditions, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment, but I would be grateful for an assurance from the Minister that my suggestion about contact between the CRE&#039;s legal experts and the Bill team could be facilitated during the interval.

In case the Law Commission has to proceed with consideration of the matter to incorporate whatever decision is made in the draft Bill, which will be laid before the ODPM early in 2005, might it be a good idea for the ODPM to initiate some discussion with the Law Commission now? It is apprised of the matter because I have told it about it, but it would be better if some approach were made to it by the ODPM.

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="40916-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The answer is obviously yes but, as I said earlier, there needs to be further thought on exactly the basis on which we make that approach. It makes a lot of sense to work out from where we are coming to start with.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>After Clause 186, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_25"></a><br>
   &quot;OBLIGATION TO UNDERTAKE PERIODIC REVIEW OF HOUSING NEEDS

<br>
(1)   The Housing Act 1985 (c. 68) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 8(1) (periodical review of housing needs) at the end insert &quot;including accommodation to meet the needs of gypsies and travellers.&quot;


<br>
(3)   In section 56 (minor definitions) insert at the appropriate place&#151;


<br>
&quot;Gypsies and Travellers&quot;&#151;


<br>
&quot;Gypsies&quot; means Romany Gypsies;


<br>
&quot;Travellers&quot; means&#151;


<br>
(a)   Irish Travellers,
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1407"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1407</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(b)   members of ethnic groups for whom living in a caravan is part of their traditional way of life, or

<br>
(c)   persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_221"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 225 and 226 are complementary to the previous amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 223 and 224&#151;and some of my concluding remarks apply also, in the round, to all of them.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Amendment No. 225 would oblige housing authorities to include in their periodic review of housing needs those of Gypsies and Travellers. It further defines Gypsies and Travellers as the earlier two amendments did, and as the noble Lord, Lord   Avebury, described, so that the definition is inclusive and does not restrict the category to where or how people have chosen to live. It is the ethnic identity which has been the subject of so much endless prejudice, and it is therefore the ethnic identity which ought to be protected.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>Amendment No. 226 amends the Housing Act 1996 to enable Gypsy and Traveller site providers to register as social landlords, and the Housing Corporation to fund such site provision and management along with its other funding purposes, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle recommended earlier today. It further inserts a definition of accommodation to include accommodation to meet the needs of Gypsies and Travellers in action to deal with homelessness. The amendment would also reiterate the new definition of Gypsies and Travellers itself in that Act. The effect of those amendments would be substantially to diminish the marginalisation of Gypsy and Traveller communities, and thus in turn to enable them to play more part in community responsibilities, as my noble friend Lord Graham indicated.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>There is general acknowledgement that the kind of change made by these amendments is necessary. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, the National Farmers Union supports these new duties and powers, as do the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Local Government Association and the Commission for Racial Equality, which of course gave particular help. So does the exemplary Cottenham Residents&#039; Association, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, described.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>I congratulate my noble friend the Minister on the Government&#039;s expressed intentions&#151;the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister thinks that the authorities should assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers; the Minister of State, my honourable friend Keith Hill, said in another place:

<a name="40916-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>This has been going on for some time. Over a year ago, in your Lordships&#039; House, my noble friend Lady Scotland of Asthal said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;we are currently looking at ways in which to develop policy that will lead to an increase in the provision of authorised sites.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>And, of course, there is the new legal duty to promote equality of opportunity under the Race Relations Act, innovated by this Government. Most recently of all, there is my right honourable friend the Chancellor&#039;s spending review document of last July:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;The Government will be looking to improve prospects for gypsies and travellers in the 2004 Spending Review&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40916-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>With all this support, as well as the explicit approach of the Government, it seems absolutely uncontroversial and straightforward to include provisions on the lines of these amendments in the Bill. I know the Government have said that they want to await the definitive recommendations of their own review of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation; but this Bill is the obvious vehicle for progress and another suitable vehicle may not come along very soon. If the Government mean business on all this, acceptance of these amendments would demonstrate it.
</p>

<a name="40916-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>Meanwhile, this is the reality for Tom Sweeney, co-chair of the Irish Travellers&#039; Movement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;my licence states that I can be given as little as seven days&#039; notice . . .  This creates for me and my family a real lack of ownership in our site; we feel like we are under continual probation. Our home does not feel like a home. I have lived on my site for 14 years and been engaged in a whole range of charity and community work with bodies like the Catholic Children&#039;s Society. I have put something into the community but what has the community given Travellers like me in return?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40916-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>Well, what has the community given him and his family and others like them in return? Shorter lives; worse health; perhaps the highest maternal death rate of all ethnic minorities; poorer educational achievements; insecurity; persecution and prejudice. Unfair treatment in housing is probably the greatest single contributor to this manifest inequality and we ought to remedy it now. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="40916-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   One point upon which the Minister did not comment in the earlier amendment was the role of registered social landlords in providing accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers. In supporting the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, I should like to press the Government on that matter.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>It is important to recognise that, although the vast majority of Gypsies, as I have said, may wish to provide their own sites, there are some who are unable to do so, financially or otherwise. Do the Government think that registered social landlords have a role to play in the provision of such sites? If so, have the Government had discussions with the Housing Corporation on facilitating the power of the corporation to fund the provision of sites? Have they spoken to any of the registered social landlords who are considering that kind of work?
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>In particular, the Novas Ouvertures Group, operates some sites that were transferred entirely into its care by local authorities. The group has the skills to manage Gypsy and Traveller sites and is willing to do the work. It has told me over the years that, if it could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1409"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1409</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

find a local authority that was willing to provide the land and the Housing Corporation provided the funding, the group could put schemes together. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, might like to know that it has discussed such schemes with a number of local authorities such as Liverpool. One might not think that Liverpool was a city with much spare land. But at least discussions were entered into with the Novas Ouvertures Group, and that might have proceeded, if the funding had been available.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>Milton Keynes is another place where there is a possible contribution to be made, because that city wishes to provide Traveller sites. If the Housing Corporation provided the funding, Novas Ouvertures&#039; offer to build and manage the site could provide an extremely fruitful partnership. I should like the Government to promote such arrangements where there is a tripartite agreement between the Housing Corporation, the registered social landlord and the local authority, so that the three together could make such provision.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>I believe that the Housing Corporation, which says that it would be glad do this if it was allowed to, and at least one registered social landlord would be willing to be involved. Perhaps the local authorities, who know they will be faced with a duty under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, would see this as a useful way of providing high quality sites that would not attract the sort of odium that some of the unauthorised sites have attracted recently.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="40916-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendment would specifically include Gypsies and Travellers in local housing needs assessments and puts forward a definition of Gypsies and Travellers. I dealt with that point earlier&#151;to the noble Lord&#039;s satisfaction, I hope. I repeat that that is actively being considered by the Gypsy and Traveller review. We will be discussing that later in the year.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, to assist local authorities in their assessment of the unique needs of Gypsies and Travellers, ODPM is updating the good practice guidance on local housing assessments that was issued to them in 2000. It will now specifically provide advice on assessing the needs of Gypsies and Travellers, setting out a baseline list of things that should be considered and recommending for the first time an appropriate methodology. That revised guidance will be in place next year. However, I am happy to consider further whether any statutory changes would be helpful, and I am happy to give a commitment that we will return to this matter on Report, if appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>Amendment No. 226 is aimed at including sites in the housing system and permitting registered social landlords to provide sites. As part of our review of Gypsy and Traveller policy, we are looking at how to mainstream Gypsy and Traveller provision in the wider housing and planning system, as I have said. We agree that for too long questions to do with the provision of sites and how they should fit in with the wider housing system have been neglected. We are now giving those questions the consideration they urgently require.

</p>

<a name="40916-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>However, the amendment could have some extreme, perhaps unintended consequences. It would make every reference to housing and accommodation in the Housing Act 1996 also cover Gypsy and Traveller sites. There are apparently over 1,000 references to these terms, covering a wide range of housing contexts, from homelessness to houses in multiple occupation, from injunctions to the powers of the Housing Corporation, from leasehold reform to introductory tenancies. For that reason I do not consider it appropriate to make all references to housing, accommodation and housing accommodation also apply to Gypsies and Travellers. Some of them are likely to conflict with existing law covering Gypsy and Traveller sites.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>The consequences of changes affecting sites and their appropriateness need careful consideration, and that is exactly what the review is doing. I quite agree that registered social landlords should be able to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers. To achieve this it is only necessary to extend the permissible purposes of registered social landlords. This could be best done through secondary legislation and I am happy to repeat the commitment that has already been given to that effect.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>I hope that the mover of the amendment will feel happy to withdraw, because I think that we are moving in the same direction, albeit in a slightly different way,   but for very good reasons. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked a question about the role of registered social landlords. Initial discussions have been undertaken with the Housing Corporation, but there have been no direct discussions with RSLs. We have committed to amending the permissible purposes of RSLs, so that they can receive grant to build sites. Those grants come from the Housing Corporation, so we are on track. Perhaps we have not travelled quite as fast and furious as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, would like, but we are making progress.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_26"></a><br>
   &quot;DISABILITY HOUSING SERVICE

<br>
(1)   The Housing Act 1996 (c. 52) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 167(2)(d) at the end insert &quot;or to meet their access needs&quot;.


<br>
(3)   After section 167(2E), insert&#151;
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1411"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1411</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
&quot;(2F)   Subject to subsection (2), the scheme may contain provision for the creation of a disability housing service consisting of&#151;

<br>
(a)   a register or database of existing or planned accessible residential properties in the local authority area, whether purpose built or adapted, with details of the access features relating to each property;


<br>
(b)   a register or database of disabled people who require accessible housing; and


<br>
(c)   a service of matching disabled people to properties so recorded.


<br>
(2G)   For the purposes of this section &quot;accessible residential properties&quot; means dwellings, flats and houses in multiple occupation in England and Wales which provide a reasonable means of access and ease of use for disabled people or which may easily be adapted to provide such access and ease of use.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_226"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am moving this amendment as my noble Friend Lady Wilkins is unfortunately not well. She knows a lot more about housing than I do, and any arguments that I hope that the Minister may find persuasive are hers. The amendment would do two things. First, it would place the access needs of disabled people at the heart of the allocations process. Currently disabled people may qualify as a priority for housing on medical and welfare grounds, which may help to explain why disabled people are not always treated with the level of priority that they deserve.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>More than one in five disabled people live in homes where it is either difficult to move around or to get in and out. That figure comes from a John Grooms survey in 2003. A quarter of wheelchair users face these problems, a third of disabled people in rented accommodation had to wait more than a year to be offered their home. More than one in ten had to wait more than three years. Mencap&#039;s <i>Housing Timebomb </i>campaign report in 2002 revealed a severe dearth of housing for people with learning disabilities. It estimated that at the current rate of provision it would take 30 years to meet the needs of people living with older parents aged 70 or over. More research by Emerson in 1996 on residential provision for people with learning disabilities demonstrates a serious shortage of alternative housing and support places outside the family home for people with a learning disability.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>Secondly, the amendment provides for local housing authorities to establish disability housing registers. Owing to the shortage of accessible housing properties, disabled people&#039;s housing options are extremely limited. Often, when a property with adaptations becomes available for letting, landlords have difficulty in identifying someone who needs it, so it may be let to someone who does not need it, or, ever worse, the adaptations may be removed from the property altogether. The amendment is designed to overcome these problems.

</p>

<a name="40916-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>A disability housing register consists of a database of accessible property, a database/register of disabled people who require accessible housing and&#151;particularly important&#151;a service of matching people to available property. Such services have been established in, for example, Leicestershire, Reading, Liverpool, Cardiff and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1412"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1412</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Glasgow. The GLA is currently examining the feasibility of a London-wide register. Its initial research has found a very high level of interest from local authorities, housing associations and local organisations of disabled people.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>More and more local authorities are realising that disability housing registers are key to better planning for future housing need, a more efficient allocations policy and for supporting real choice and independent living for disabled people.

</p>

<a name="40916-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>At Second Reading on 7 June (at col. 132 of the <i>Official Report</i>) the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, suggested that statutory provision for DHRs would create a disproportionate burden on local authorities. That is rather surprising, given the degree of interest from authorities themselves and the amount of advice and support available from HoDis&#151;the National Disabled Persons Housing Service&#151;and other organisations to set up and run such schemes, together with the success of existing schemes and the major cost-savings, which can be in the region of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>Along with the Disability Rights Commission, HoDis, Mencap, the RNIB, RADAR, Shelter and countless others, which I had better not mention now because we are short of time, I believe that the time has   come to place disability housing registers on a statutory basis. The amendment as drafted does not impose an absolute duty on local authorities; it is discretionary. Nevertheless, I think that it would create a powerful lever to ensure that such services become the norm across the country.
</p>

<a name="40916-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>Therefore, I very much hope that the Minister will respond positively and that he may even bring forward a government amendment in time for the Report stage. If so, perhaps we could see it beforehand. I look forward to his response. I beg to move.

It will not improve the argument for me to repeat the points made very clearly by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy. I shall say only that I am particularly glad to be able to support an amendment which is discretionary for local authorities. I always struggle when we ask local authorities to take on yet more duties. But I think that the noble Baroness&#039;s point about a lever is a very good one.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>I am also mildly amused that we are yet again proposing a voluntary scheme in view of the two days that we spent on the issues of compulsion and discretion in relation to another part of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="40916-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   I also support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has carried out some work on accessible housing registers, so perhaps I may add one or two reasons why it may be worth the Minister supporting the amendment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1413"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1413</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>We started work about 12 years ago in Kent, where a disabled persons&#039; accommodation agency tested the scheme. It has now spread to other parts of the country, the work done there being picked up by HoDis&#151;the National Disabled Persons Housing Service&#151;with Ginnie Shaw at the helm.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>I think that this issue has become increasingly important because the housing associations and the local authorities have to meet targets in their re-letting of vacant properties. There is pressure on them to get on with the job and to do so quickly if they are not to lose points with their regulators and the people who are interested in their affairs. If they have to sit around and wait while they search for a disabled person to fill a vacancy because they are letting a property with, for example, an extension at the back with a downstairs bathroom, they will be losing time and losing points in the great scheme of things. If there is a register that can be accessed quickly so that they can find a person for whom such an adaptation is suited, they can proceed. It will not then be necessary, as so often happens, to rip out the adaptations that have already been made and refurbish for someone with no mobility needs. Accessible housing registers are very useful in the social housing sector.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>A register would also be useful in the private sector among private landlords who, unless there is an easily accessible place, do not know where to look for a disabled tenant when they have a property that has had some adaptations made to it. Even in the owner-occupier sector, estate agencies can be drawn in voluntarily to a scheme of this kind. There are schemes in Yorkshire, Sheffield and Bradford, but I single out the one in Leeds for special praise because it has targeted the private sector. The register there includes details of homes that are on the market privately but which are suitable for disabled people.

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>The system is picking up a little steam. The trouble is that it is moving rather slowly and this amendment to the Bill would give added impetus to local authorities to pursue a scheme for accessible housing registers. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="40916-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The Government fully appreciate and concur with the motivation behind the amendment. We recognise that it is of enormous importance that people with disabilities are housed appropriately. That is why the Government encourage local housing authorities to maintain lists of properties that are suitable for disabled people. Our code of guidance on allocations, issued in November 2002, recommends that housing authorities maintain lists of properties that are suitable for disabled people and other special needs groups. Such lists might include all accessible or significantly adapted local authority stock, RSL properties and private sector properties to which authorities nominate tenants who need to be brought within it.

</p>

<a name="40916-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>In addition to the statutory guidance, good practice guidance on disabled housing registers is also available to social landlords. <i>A Perfect Match?</i>, published jointly by the Housing Corporation and the National Disabled Persons Housing Service in 1999, is currently being <br>&nbsp;<br>

updated and is designed to help spread best practice in this area and to support the creation of matching services.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to require local authorities to give reasonable preference, when allocating accommodation, to people who need to move to meet their access needs. The Government agree, but that is already covered in Section 167(2)(d) which includes people who need to move on medical grounds.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>The amendment also proposes that a local authority&#039;s allocation scheme may make provision for a disability housing service. The disability housing service includes the creation of a register or database of existing or planned accessible residential properties in the local authority area, whether purpose-built or adapted, with details of the access features relating to each property, a register of disabled people who require accessible housing and a service of matching disabled people to properties so recorded.

</p>

<a name="40916-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>The Government have a number of difficulties with what is proposed. The Government repealed the duty to maintain a housing register in the Homelessness Act   2002. Nevertheless, local authorities still have the power to maintain registers and our code of guidance on allocations explicitly recognises that local authorities may want to continue to keep registers of applicants.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>As I have already said, the code also encourages local authorities to maintain lists of social housing properties that are suitable for disabled people. That approach was taken because we believe that, if a local authority has a choice about keeping a register, then it should be included in statutory guidance rather than in primary legislation. We believe that local authorities should be able to decide what registers they keep and what should be on those registers. The amendment is too prescriptive as it describes in detail what should be kept on those registers, including information that is clearly not relevant to a local authority&#039;s statutory functions.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The Government are of the view that the best approach to matching services is to let applicants bid for properties under a choice-based letting scheme. Such schemes provide for information to be available on each property, including the extent of any adaptations, allowing those with disabilities to select appropriate housing at the time of its availability. We have set a target that all local authorities will have adopted a choice-based letting scheme by 2010.
<a name="time_24"></a>
<a name="40916-31_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>There are likely to be significant cost implications to a local authority should it decide to set up a disabled housing service, as proposed in the amendment. It is also unclear how local authorities would obtain the information required by the registers, other than the information being voluntarily provided. Verification of that information would involve carrying out expensive and comprehensive stock condition surveys.

</p>

<a name="40916-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>I would like to give some assurance that, in terms of new housing, we are also taking action in a variety of ways to increase the supply of housing accessible to people with a disability. All newly built homes are required to comply with Part M of the building regulations. Those provisions are expected to enable occupants to cope better with reduced mobility and live longer in their own home. The Government require that all schemes funded through the Housing Corporation comply not only with the building regulations but with additional criteria for accessibility. Our reform of the planning system also seeks to introduce a statutory requirement for those responsible for preparing regional spatial strategies and local development documents in England to undertake those functions with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>Our consultation draft, Planning Policy Statement 1, makes it crystal clear that development plans should contain clear and comprehensive inclusive access policies. Not only are we taking action to improve accessibility in relation to new developments, but we have substantially increased government resources available to fund adaptations to the existing stock to meet the needs of disabled people. The disabled facilities grant programme provides funding for local authorities to help disabled homeowners and tenants to pay for essential adaptations to their home. Since 1997, government funding for disabled facilities grants has nearly doubled, rising to &#163;100 million a year. This year, over 33,000 homes will be adapted to meet the needs of disabled people through the programme, a 50   per cent increase on 1997&#150;98.
</p>

<a name="40916-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>The voluntary approach is the best one&#151;it enables choice. We have committed, and are committing, substantial resources to ensure local authority stock is better in terms of disabled access, and a lot of progress has already been made. Many valuable and important local initiatives have been adopted by local housing authorities and the registered social landlords sector. So, while I appreciate the import and value of the Amendment and the encouragement it generally provides, it is probably not the best way forward at this stage.

As I said, housing is not my thing. I thank the Minister for his reply. He said that medical grounds were already mentioned. That is the whole point&#151;we want the social model of disability, not the   medical one.

I appreciate the money that has been spent on housing for disabled people, but then, as my noble friend Lord   Best pointed out, a register would save people time in finding a suitable property that had been adapted.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>After Clause 186, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_27"></a><br>
   &quot;CONSENT FOR PHYSICAL ALTERATIONS TO PREMISES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE

<br>
(1)   The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c. 50) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   After section 24 there is inserted&#151;


<br>
&quot;24A   ALTERATIONS TO LET PREMISES AND PREMISES TO LET


<br>
(1)   This section applies where&#151;


<br>
(a)   a disabled person occupies premises under a lease or is considering taking a letting of the premises;


<br>
(b)   but for this section, he would not be entitled to make a particular alteration to the premises or to the access and approach to the premises; and


<br>
(c)   the alteration is one which he proposes to make in order to&#151;


<br>
(i)   enable him to enjoy the premises;


<br>
(ii)   enable him to make use of any benefit or facility, which by reason of the letting is one of which he is entitled to make use;


<br>
(iii)   facilitate his enjoyment of the premises or his making use of any such benefit or facility;
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1417"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1417</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(iv)   enable him to become a person to whom the premises are let; or

<br>
(v)   facilitate his becoming a person to whom the premises are let; 


<br>
but would be of little or no practical use to him or if he were neither a person to whom the premises are let nor an occupier of them or if he were not considering taking a letting of the premises.


<br>
(2)   Except to the extent to which it expressly so provides, the lease shall have effect by virtue of this subsection as if it provided&#151;


<br>
(a)   for the disabled person to be entitled to make the alteration with the written consent of the lessor;


<br>
(b)   for the relevant disabled person, or someone acting on his behalf to have to make a written application to the lessor for consent if he wishes to make the alteration;


<br>
(c)   if such an application is made, for the lessor not to withhold his consent unreasonably; and


<br>
(d)   for the lessor to be entitled to make his consent subject to reasonable conditions.


<br>
(3)   Regulations may make provision&#151;


<br>
(a)   as to circumstances in which it is, or as to circumstances in which it is not, reasonable for a lessor to withhold his consent, and 


<br>
(b)   as to conditions which it is always, or conditions which it is never, reasonable for a lessor to impose.


<br>
(4)   In this section&#151;


<br>
&quot;lease&quot; includes a tenancy, sub-lease or sub-tenancy and an agreement for a lease, tenancy, sub-lease or sub-tenancy; and


<br>
&quot;sub-lease&quot; and &quot;sub-tenancy&quot; have such meaning as may be prescribed.


<br>
(5)   For the purposes of this section, premises shall be treated as let to a person where they are a commonhold unit of which he is a unit-holder; and &quot;commonhold unit&quot; and &quot;unit-holder&quot; in relation to such a unit, have here the same meaning as in Part 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_234"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 229 is probing&#151;but perhaps more of a prodding amendment, as I hope that the Minister will agree to take the issue forward. The Joint Committee on the Draft Disability Discrimination Bill followed the Disability Rights Task Force in recommending that the forthcoming Bill should include specific provisions preventing landlords and management committees unreasonably refusing consent to disabled people who need to make physical changes to their properties, including communal areas, in order to enjoy fundamental rights of access. Some 17,000 disabled tenants living in unsuitable accommodation report that they have been prevented from making essential alterations or adaptations because their landlord has refused consent.

</p>

<a name="40916-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>The committee asked whether adequate provisions existed in current housing and land law, as the Government claim, to address the problem. The resounding reply from the Disability Rights Commission, the Law Society and housing associations was &quot;No&quot;. So it looked at the matter in great detail and found that the existing provisions were over-complex, partial and unenforceable. For instance, at present, the right to make alterations in many leases will be confined to the actual premises leased, so a totally accessible flat may be of little use if you have to negotiate a short flight <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1418"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1418</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of steps to get in. Even if the lease permits you to make reasonable adaptations to the property itself, there is no statutory guidance on the weight to be attached to the disabled person&#039;s access needs as opposed to the property interests of others. Decisions in other areas of land law are not encouraging.
</p>

<a name="40916-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>Current law also fails to deal with the common and desperate situation where a disabled person is ready to buy a leasehold flat or home and cannot gain consent from the management company to make alterations, often relating to getting to and through their own front door. Management companies can turn down requests for the flimsiest of reasons because there is no clear statutory guidance.

</p>

<a name="40916-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>While the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 protects disabled tenants in social housing from landlords withholding consent unreasonably, disabled tenants in England and Wales are not afforded the same protection. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 does not apply in England and Wales, if the lease is silent on the issue of alterations or improvements, or if it contains an absolute prohibition against them. It applies only if there is a clause in a lease making the carrying out of improvements conditional on the landlord&#039;s consent.
</p>

<a name="40916-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>In sum, the current provisions are a nightmare for disabled people and landlords alike, and there is no example of a disabled person successfully using them to enforce a right to make reasonable adaptations. Quite why the Government feel that they suffice is unclear.
</p>

<a name="40916-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>The amendment would operate like the existing provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act, which enable service providers and employers to approach their landlords to make reasonable adjustments to their property. The reasonableness criteria, which would need to be expanded upon in regulations, would give greater clarity and ensure a better balance between the rights of disabled people and those of landlords.


</p>

<a name="40916-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>A small pub or shop may now have to pay to make an adjustment for one visit by a disabled person under the DDA. A person living in his own home has no rights at present even to pay for his own adjustments. I stress that the amendment does not require any landlords to finance alterations.
</p>

<a name="40916-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>The Disability Rights Commission would also be empowered to issue guidance and support disabled people to bring cases&#151;something they cannot do under housing or land legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>I appreciate the need not to overload the statute book with unnecessary regulation, but in this case, all parties would benefit from new provisions in disability rights legislation. I hope that the Minister can give an encouraging response and that he will see that his department gives this further thought in relation to the new disability Bill. I beg to move.

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1419</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

draft Disability Discrimination Bill, which is already being considered by the joint parliamentary scrutiny committee. The Government have already published their response to a report by that committee, in which a similar proposal was made. I am afraid that what I have to say now is therefore a reflection of that response.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>Amendment No. 229 seeks to put landlords under a duty not to refuse consent unreasonably if a disabled person, whether a tenant or occupier, or a disabled person intending to become a tenant, wants to make an alteration to the physical features of a property that they are renting or proposing to rent. The consent must be given and may be subject to reasonable conditions. The reasonableness of a refusal or of the conditions that may be imposed may be the subject of secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>It is rather odd that the amendment would enable a person who has not yet rented the premises to have a right to make alterations&#151;that is one of its defects. Of course, the amendment would allow the landlord to impose reasonable conditions when giving any consent. Even so, this highlights some rather difficult contractual arrangements that would need to be carefully considered. They would have to be considered against the limited security of tenure that tenants in the private rented sector have and the fact that turnover in that sector is of the order of 40 per cent per annum.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>The amendment is also silent on how the costs of such alterations are to be met. Perhaps it is envisaged that this could be catered for by secondary legislation. However, I think it is important that we address costs, because that is the issue on which the effectiveness of any such provision must rest.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>In response to a similar proposal for the draft Disability Discrimination Bill, we have said that it provides no new rights to replace those that currently exist. For council tenants and Rent Act tenants, these are provided under the Housing Acts 1980 and 1985. For private tenants there is, of course, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>The 1927 Act provides that landlords should not unreasonably withhold licence or consent to the making of improvements by a tenant, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary in the lease. However, the 1927 Act does not go on to make clear provisions for costs. It says that the landlord may require, as a condition of such licence or consent, the payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to the landlord, and of any legal or other expenses properly incurred in connection with such licence or consent.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>The Act also allows the landlord, in the case of an improvement which does not add to the letting value of the holding, to require an undertaking on the part of the tenant to reinstate the premises.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>I can see that the financial side of any licence or consent that may have been made under the 1927 Act is likely to be little used. But I do not see that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1420"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1420</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment addresses that or necessarily makes any new provision that should displace it. It therefore needlessly duplicates the provisions of the earlier legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>I am sorry that my response is somewhat negative, but I am not sure that this is the right way to proceed with this issue. I think that there are fundamental flaws in the amendment which need to be addressed before any progress can be made in this respect.

</p>

<a name="40916-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>The tenant can pay costs. It would be reasonable to make consent contingent on the disabled person covering the cost of reinstatement if that were necessary. Reinstatement would be less likely if one had the register anyway, because a landlord might be able to let the property to another suitable user.

</p>

<a name="40916-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>We must look into the claim that 1927 Act does not apply. That is a serious issue. That claim was also made in the Government&#039;s response. There is clearly not a meeting of minds. Land and house law are not clear. I have said that decisions in other areas of land law are not encouraging. Those decisions suggest that very little weight will be attached to the desirability of facilitating access for disabled people and their interests will be easily overridden. In <i>Drury </i>v<i> McGarvie</i>, for instance, it was held that badly constructed gates did not amount to an obstruction of a disabled person&#039;s right of way across farmland to his home, because they would not have constituted a material inconvenience for a person of average strength and agility or the ordinary, able-bodied adult.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>If that kind of decision is going to be applied to someone who can get into an accessible flat, but that flat has a flight of steps up to it, we will not get very far. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, perhaps the Minister&#039;s officials, the DRC and other officials could meet to thrash out the issue and construct a viable amendment to the disability rights Bill.

   &quot;PERMANENTLY MOORED SERVICED RESIDENTIAL HOUSEBOATS

<p><a name="st_242"></a>The noble Baroness said: What seems an eon ago, we were discussing park homes. Amendment No. 229A would extend the protection and safeguards that we have just discussed for residents of park homes to residents of permanently moored, serviced houseboats.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>I stress the words &quot;permanently moored&quot; and &quot;serviced&quot; because there has been much correspondence relating to interfering with navigation on the waterways. Those boats are moored on permanent moorings and they do not move. To all intents and purposes, they are permanent accommodation on water.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>At Second Reading, we were delighted that the Government accepted that the provisions for mobile homes could be extended to houseboat residents and we believed that we had won a famous victory, which would be quickly confirmed in Committee&#151;only to find that it was a Pyrrhic victory. The fastest U-turn in history took place, via a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which stated that the acceptance by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, of our case was a mistake. We were enormously grateful to the noble Lord when he accepted the view that he might have indulged in some wishful thinking. The Bill is an appropriate vehicle by which the matter can be resolved.
</p>

<a name="40916-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>It is an important issue. I readily admit that it has arisen because of the concerns of residential boat dwellers in Cheyne Walk and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where I am an elected councillor. However, clusters of permanently moored houseboats appear across the country and there is no&#151;or none that I could find&#151;legislation or existing statutes which are germane to their situation. They have no protection in law, which is exactly the same situation that is now being addressed for mobile home owners. The houseboat owners who have briefed me have had an inordinate amount of discussion with the   Port of London Authority, which licenses the moorings&#039; owners and has not been particularly bothered or concerned by the problem; Defra, which has now concluded that it is not the right department; and the ODPM. Each of these has managed to pass the buck.

<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>This amendment may not precisely do the trick but we must not let the opportunity of the Bill pass without finding a way of dealing with these dwellers, who appear to be outside every form of protection and legislation and who are vulnerable to abuse of their right to live in and enjoy their residence free from harassment and fear of eviction. If the Minister cannot accept our thoughts today, then I ask him to enable his lawyers during the coming Recess weeks to meet those who seek to have these matters rectified and to come up with an answer that will do it.

<a name="40916-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   I put my name to this amendment. I, too, was frustrated over what amendment should be tabled and, indeed, before we started the Committee stage I tried to establish whether we should be seeking an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill as I thought that it might be raised as an obstacle against extending the provisions of the Bill to houseboats and houseboat owners. There was the inevitable circular discussion because it depended on what we wanted to do within the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>Be that as it may, we talked yesterday about the public&#039;s views of politicians. It is something that we talk about from time to time in a rather self-deprecating fashion. I am sure we all think, &quot;That does not quite apply to all politicians and I am one of the exceptions&quot;. In this House, we are in danger of confirming the sense of helplessness that non-politicians must have. The noble Baroness has referred to what happened at, and immediately after, Second Reading. I know that the Minister has certainly had one, and I am sure far more than one, letter from a houseboat owner. I shall quote from it because I would like to see the words of a houseboat owner quoted in this context. I am aware of the time, so I am not going to take very long:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;I am sure you can imagine the sense of enormous disappointment among residential houseboat owners that just when it looked as if the injustices they have suffered for so many years were to be put right you are apparently going to overturn this at the last minute.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;Throughout the discussions a number of us have had with politicians from all parties and with senior civil servants we have always received total support for the case we have been putting forward&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>It always seems to me that problems that affect one&#039;s own home must be experienced particularly intensely. They are with one all the time. Therefore, for Opposition Members of your Lordships&#039; House not yet to have found a way to persuade the Government that for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to refer the people involved to Defra and for Defra to tell them that it is a matter for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister leaves us wondering what we can do to get bits of government not just to talk to one another but to find a solution to a very real problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="40916-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I should like to underline the first point made by my noble friend Lady Hamwee that this problem has been going on for a very long time. I was a houseboat owner at the end of the 1970s and 1980s. I am glad to say that my landlord&#151;the 3rd Osterley Sea Scouts&#151;being a charity, actually treated its houseboat tenants very well. But I am aware of a number of cases where that was not the case, and not only up and down the Thames. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to the houseboat dwellers of Chelsea.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1423</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>At the end of the 1980s, the Select Committee in the other place took extensive evidence from a resident houseboat owner on the Cheshire Ring. I know that others gave evidence too, when they were examining waterways issues, of the sort of harassment that can happen. Houseboat owners&#151;all sorts of dwellers&#151;are particularly vulnerable. It is very easy to cut hosepipes, and to loosen ropes. I do not need to catalogue the sorts of harassment that can happen, because Members of the Committee can probably imagine it. But the time must have come for the Government to address the matter, and this seems the perfect Bill in which to do so. I welcome the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="40916-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am not sure which amendment the noble Baroness was speaking to&#151;Amendment No. 229A or 229B&#151;because it is the latter that deals with harassment. However, I might as well refer to that amendment, as it is only a couple of paragraphs. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 is not limited to residential occupiers of any particular type but extends to members of the public generally. To that extent, it must include houseboat owners, so Amendment No. 229B is unnecessary. I cannot speak as a lawyer on a particular case, and only the courts could give a definitive view, but the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 covers the general public, so it must cover houseboat owners.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>On Amendment No. 229A, the substantive amendment, I would like to get a certain matter out of the way. A genuine mistake occurred on Second Reading. Let us not make a big fuss about it&#151;it was a genuine mistake which I corrected immediately. We did not give anyone a false impression; I do not want anyone to argue that we lied or misled them. It was a genuine mistake at the Dispatch Box, and we corrected it straightaway.

</p>

<a name="40916-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>The amendment would give the same rights as apply to park home occupiers to residential houseboat occupiers. Currently, the rights of residential houseboat occupiers will depend, first, on the terms of the agreement with the owner of the mooring&#151;so there is an issue there. Secondly, it will depend on the terms of the agreement between the occupier and the owner of the houseboat, because they could be different people.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>There is no statutory security of tenure, and the relationship between the parties is dependent on the   terms of their own contractual arrangements. The normal rules of contract law will apply, along with the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, which is policed by the Office of Fair Trading. The proposed amendment would not in fact provide the security of tenure desired by houseboat owners.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>There is currently no statutory security of tenure relating to houseboats. The amendments in the Bill for park homes consist of amendments to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 and the Caravan Sites Act 1968. To apply the clauses to houseboats as well would be meaningless, because these Acts do not apply to houseboats.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>It is the department&#039;s view that houseboat residents are already covered by the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. This has two main consequences: first, that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1424"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1424</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occupiers are protected from unlawful eviction and harassment and, secondly, that possession can occur only after an order for possession from a court has been obtained. That is the general view; on the specifics, as Members of the Committee must understand, it would be down to the case in court.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>We are aware of worries about the adequacy of the law relating to houseboats, and we are currently in discussion with our colleagues at both the Department for Transport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who lead on policy involving British Waterways and the Port of London Authority. Notwithstanding what has been said here today, we are in discussion with those two departments.
<a name="time_26"></a>
<a name="40916-34_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>Security of tenure of houseboats is a complex issue. Someone said to me that they are effectively parked on the highway. I have a list of different kinds of moorings that I could read out. It is amazingly complicated. As a result of the discussions, DEFRA has commissioned a scoping study on how the issues can be effectively dealt with. That will provide an opportunity to establish the size and scope of the issue and identify any necessary legislative change, for which we can then press.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>If we accepted the amendment now we would be giving houseboat owners ill-considered legislation, because it does not apply to them. We have made provision for park home owners in other Acts of Parliament that do not apply. I do not know anything about one department passing the buck to the other; I am giving the Government&#039;s considered view. We are in discussion with colleagues in both DEFRA and the   Department for Transport and the study commissioned by DEFRA will aim to satisfy the problems identified.
</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="40916-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   The trouble is that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. The reason why I separated Amendments Nos. 229A and 229B was specific: I needed the Minister&#039;s categoric assurance&#151;which he has now given&#151;that the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 covered those resident on permanently moored houseboats. The reason I asked for the assurance and tabled a question&#151;I did not know which would come first&#151;is because council and legal opinions have varied. I am aware of a case where a definitive answer matters urgently. I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation that the Act applies.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 229A, these discussions have been going on an inordinately long time with people passing the matter on. The Minister says that he does not know anything about it, but I can assure him that departments have been involved one after another and one after the other have said that they have no role. The DEFRA role is on waterways. These people are permanently moored. The Minister almost made the case that they were parked on the highway, but actually they are parked on the sidelines of a highway. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1425"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1425</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We cannot move them; if we move them they will sink. They have flowerpots and so on all around them. They are to all intents and purposes permanent residents.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>They are not covered by the Housing Acts, however we look at it, which is what they need. I do not think that they are looking for statutory security of tenure but the recognition that they can be covered by the Housing Acts for all intents and purposes. That is what we need to consider. I accept that my amendment is inappropriate. When I read the preceding clauses on mobile homes I realised that it was not appropriate, but it was the only way I could get the issue into the Bill. I wanted to propose longer clauses, which would have explained the whole matter, but they were not allowed. Now I will have to try to get my new clause back in on Report.
</p>

<a name="40916-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>It would be helpful if the ODPM lawyers would talk to permanently moored houseboat owners, which they may be starting to, because they are distinctly left out of any legislation. It is obvious that this is the legislation to get provisions into. We have about three-and-a-half weeks before Report stage and I hope we might be able to conduct some discussions that would tell us how to get appropriate amendments into the Bill. In the meantime I thank the Minister for his reassurance about the Protection from Eviction Act and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

   &quot;ENERGY EFFICIENCY: IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY

<br>
(1)   For the purposes of&#151;


<br>
(a)   improving the energy efficiency of residential accommodation;


<br>
(b)   increasing the comfort level of occupants of residential accommodation; and


<br>

<br>
(2)   In this section&#151; 


<br>
&quot;fuel poverty&quot; has the same meaning as in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 (c. 31); and


<br>
&quot;residential energy efficiency&quot; means the energy efficiency of residential accommodation.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_248"></a>The noble Baroness said: I have pruned enormously what I was going to say on the remaining amendments so I hope that we can scramble through them.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>The target of a 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency by 2010 was first set by the Conservative government in 1996 under the Home Energy Conservation Act. Then the target was 30 per cent by 2010, but 30 per cent from 1996 is almost the same as 20 per cent based on 2000 levels. For years that target was accepted by this Government.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1426"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1426</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>The 20 per cent improvement based on 2000 levels is just another way of saying that the target is the saving of 5 megatonnes of carbon from domestic energy efficiency by 2010. A recent publication from the Association for the Conservation of Energy explains in detail the 15 categorical assurances given to the industry that the Government were committed to achieving the 5 megatonnes of carbon savings from domestic energy efficiency specified in the White Paper. Six assurances were given by four separate government Ministers, including two in this House by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and by the Permanent Secretary at the DTI and by the Treasury. That is all very specific.

</p>

<a name="40916-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>In the event, on 26 April the Government abandoned all those assurances and set the target as the saving of 4.2 megatonnes of carbon by 2010&#151;a reduction of 16 per cent&#151;in their energy efficiency implementation plan. Given this explanation I hope that the Government will lend their support to Amendment No. 230 today to ensure that the aim is increased to the original 20 per cent figure. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="40916-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 230ZA standing in the name of my noble friend Lady Maddock. I wish to speak briefly also to Amendment No. 230 with which it is grouped as that is an extremely good amendment. However, I should add one small caveat; namely, if all the new builds that took place met the required energy efficiency standards and builders did not cut corners, an enormous amount of energy efficiency would be gained. One of the major problems in this country is that there are not enough building inspectors to ensure that all the new builds match the guidelines set out. It would be helpful if something could be done about that. I plan to bring forward an amendment at a later stage of the Bill to prompt the Government on that issue.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>Amendment No. 230ZA seeks to deal with the issues of efficiency and fuel poverty. One way of doing that is to provide an alternative source of energy than electricity and gas from the grid. One of the major problems connected with fuel poverty is that many people are not connected to the gas main and therefore have to purchase power sources that are extremely expensive in order to keep warm. Many tried and trusted technologies could be installed. The two areas considered in the amendment are micro combined heat and power and domestic heat pumps.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>Domestic heat pumps will be fairly difficult to install except in new builds. However, there are alternatives not mentioned in the amendment such as photovoltaics and solar heating panels which could be installed on almost any building in the country and would significantly cut the amount of electricity and heat energy required by many people in this country.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>One of the reasons for raising this issue is that there is a small problem of joined-up government. As was mentioned earlier, the introduction of many of these technologies requires an up-front capital cost which many people would find difficult to meet. Grants are available. However, those grants are made available <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1427"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1427</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by the DTI not by the ODPM. That seems to be one of the major problems with the two schemes. The ODPM introduced this Housing Bill but the DTI should have had a lot of input in terms of government strategy on renewable energy sources.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>My specific area of concern was mentioned by the Prime Minister. We are pumping out a large amount of carbon through inefficient energy resources such as boilers. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister should mention that aspect, which I agree is important, but at the same time the clear skies grant is being cut from the amount that was available two years ago to a much more insignificant sum at present.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>If the Government really are serious about cutting carbon emissions and increasing renewables such as photovoltaics and micro-combined heat and power, they are going to have to increase the amount of money available. The amendment refers simply to a strategy, but this is an area that we feel very strongly about and which the Government are going to have to take seriously and fund in the short term.
</p>




<p><a name="st_250"></a>
<a name="40916-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Coming back to energy, Amendment No. 230 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to ensure an increase of at least 20 per cent in residential energy efficiency by 2010. I am not going to bandy statistics, but I should point out that the existing aim set out in the energy efficiency plan of action&#151;it was only published in April this year&#151;to secure an annual carbon saving from the UK household sector of approximately 4.2 million tonnes by 2010, is indeed broadly equivalent to the 20 per cent improvement sought through this amendment. Furthermore, the Government&#039;s existing aim allows for the flexibility of review and, if necessary, an increase in the aim.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>We are already doing a great deal to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector. Key to this is our determination to implement the decent homes standard, with its commitment to ensuring good standards of heating and insulation, and in that way supporting the Government&#039;s drive towards the elimination of fuel poverty. I will have more to say about that when I come to Amendment No. 232.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>The Government strongly believe that there should be a commitment to a level of carbon savings from domestic energy efficiency. We already have a mechanism for giving effect to that commitment: the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, under which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published an energy efficiency aim for England in the energy efficiency plan of action earlier this year. That makes provision for a review of the commitment, and that is the sensible approach to setting the targets. In other words, the place for doing that is the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, and not this Bill. It is a more appropriate vehicle. We are not going soft on the issue, believe me.
</p>

<a name="40916-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale&#151;I cannot resist this&#151;waxes lyrical about the Department of Trade and Industry. I thought this was the department his <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="40916-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   I was dealing with the reality that the DTI is in existence and they are the ones who deal with the Clear Skies scheme, an excellent scheme which I hope the Minister will look into. The point I was trying to get across was that the DTI is spending a pitiful amount on that scheme, which is the main thrust for renewables. If we are serious about renewables, perhaps we could get rid of the DTI and use the entire budget on renewables. I would be very happy if he would agree with that this evening.

<p><a name="st_253"></a>
<a name="40916-35_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but I need to point out that the Clear Skies project, which the Minister undertook to look into, has been reduced in grant, as my noble friend Lord Redesdale says. One of the issues is that one can claim the grant only if one uses one of the registered installers. That is a condition of the grant. However, when you go to the Clear Skies website and look up the list of registered installers, all you get is a box with a cross through it. So, in fact, you cannot use the registered installers, because you cannot see who they are. Then the DTI will claim not many people are taking up the grant, and therefore the demand for it has dropped so less money will be put in. I simply say this to illustrate that all is not well.

<a name="40916-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Absolutely, and I will certainly be happy to come back to this on Report. In respect of Amendment 230ZA, my noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton reminded me that if noble Lords cast their minds back to before the Summer Recess, they will recall how the House saw a great deal of debate on the Energy Bill. I sat in on a few days myself, muttering under my breath. There are worries about security of supply and such matters, and the Prime Minister addressed some of these issues the other day. The Energy Act includes a duty for the Secretary of State to publish a strategy for the promotion of micro-generation in Great Britain.

(b)   setting out the reasons why the landlord intends to demolish the relevant premises,


<br>
(c)   specifying the period within which he intends to demolish those premises,


<br>
(d)   stating that, while the notice remains in force, he will not be under any obligation to make such a grant as is mentioned in section 138(1) in respect of any claim made by the tenant to exercise the right to buy in respect of the dwelling-house.


<br>
(2)   An initial demolition notice must also state&#151;

(i)   the making by the tenant of any such claim, or


<br>
(ii)   the taking of steps under this Part in connection with any such claim up to the point where section 138(1) would otherwise operate in relation to the claim, or

(iii)   the operation of that provision in most circumstances where the notice ceases to be in force, but


<br>
(b)   that, if the landlord subsequently serves a final demolition notice in respect of the dwelling-house, the right to buy will not arise in respect of it while that notice is in force and any existing claim will cease to be effective.

5   (1)   This paragraph applies to an insurance scheme.


<br>
(2)   The scheme must provide that any landlord by whom a tenancy deposit is retained under the scheme must give the scheme administrator an undertaking that, if at the end of the tenancy any amount in respect of the deposit is paid to the tenant by the scheme administrator in accordance with paragraph 6(5), the landlord will reimburse that amount to the scheme administrator in accordance with directions given by it.


<br>
(3)   The scheme must require the scheme administrator to effect and maintain in force adequate insurance in respect of failures by landlords by whom tenancy deposits are retained under the scheme to comply with such directions as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2).


<br>
(4)   If the scheme provides for landlords participating in the scheme to be members of the scheme, the scheme may provide for a landlord&#039;s membership to be terminated by the scheme administrator in the event of any such failure on the part of the landlord.

(5)   The scheme may provide for landlords participating in the scheme to pay to the scheme administrator&#151;


<br>
(a)   fees in respect of the administration of the scheme, and

<br>
6   (1)   An insurance scheme must make provision in accordance with this paragraph in relation to the respective obligations of the landlord and the scheme administrator where&#151;


<br>
(a)   a tenancy deposit has been retained by the landlord under the scheme, and


<br>
(b)   the tenancy has ended.


<br>
(2)   If the tenant and the landlord agree that the whole or part of the deposit should be repaid to the tenant, the landlord must repay the amount in question (&quot;the agreed amount&quot;) to the tenant within the period of 10 days beginning with the date on which the agreement is made. 


<br>
(3)   Sub-paragraph (5) applies where the tenant notifies the scheme administrator that&#151;


<br>
(a)   there has been such an agreement as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), but


<br>
(b)   the agreed amount has not been repaid within the period mentioned in that sub-paragraph.


<br>
(4)   Sub-paragraph (5) also applies where the tenant notifies the scheme administrator that&#151;


<br>
(a)   there has been no such agreement as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), but


<br>
(b)   a court has decided that the tenant is entitled to the whole or part of the deposit (&quot;the due amount&quot;), and


<br>
(c)   that decision has become final (see paragraph 4(6) and (7)).

</p>




<p><a name="st_259"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak to the others in the group, which are almost identical except for one that leaves out lines 18 to 25 on page 146. As drafted, Clause 190 would allow the relevant authority to pay grants to companies other than registered social landlords for essentially the same housing purpose as for which they make grants to registered social landlords. For the purpose of the clause, &quot;company&quot; means a company registered under the Companies Act 1985 and ALMOs&#151;that is, arm&#039;s-length management organisations.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>This group of amendments would broaden the range of organisations eligible to receive grant. We have listened to arguments from the Opposition in the other place, and do not wish to exclude any potentially suitable providers. The amendments would mean that persons eligible to bid for grant would no longer be restricted to companies as defined under the Companies Act 1985 or arm&#039;s-length management organisations. The amendment would allow the Housing Corporation to pay grant to &quot;persons&quot;, as defined in the Interpretation Act 1978. That would include a body of persons corporate or unincorporate.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1436"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1436</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>The amendment would prevent situations from occurring where, for example, a joint venture between developers established as a company would qualify for grant, but a limited liability partnership joint venture between the same development partners would not. We still believe that a requirement for applicants to be registered companies would provide some additional assurances on their viability. However, the amendments will not mean that unsuitable persons will now be able to be allocated grant. I want to make that absolutely clear.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a>The Housing Corporation will be expected to make sure that only fit and proper persons receive funding. The reassurances that we want about the suitability of bodies can be sought in other ways&#151;for example, as part of the corporation&#039;s &quot;due diligence&quot; work. These amendments would also bring the clause into line with general European Union policy, which seeks to avoid discrimination on the constitutional status and geographical basis of organisations.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>The intention behind Amendments Nos. 230D and 231F appears to be to widen the range of bodies to which the Housing Corporation can pay grant. Frankly, the amendments that we have tabled are similar, taking into account the concerns raised in previous debates. However, the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Best, would seek to place more restrictions on the definition of an eligible body than the Government are proposing. They would prevent government and governmental bodies, contracting authorities or individuals from applying. It is unlikely that many of the bodies excluded by these amendments would submit a bid. For example, the Public Services Contract Regulations include such bodies as national museums, tribunals and rent assessment panels.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_580"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Best, is right&#151;I understand that this is a key concern and one we share&#151;to be concerned that only suitable persons should receive the grant. But we think that that can be achieved without placing the restrictions on who is able to bid for the grant. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_263"></a>The noble Baroness said: We talked at length earlier about the needs of rural areas, so I will not go back into those arguments that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, replied to. This amendment seeks to make sure that the inevitable economies of scale that urban areas enjoy do   not mean that an enormous proportion&#151;disproportionate to the population&#151;of the proposed grant goes only to urban and suburban areas, leaving rural areas to lose out, as they have done in the past.

</p>

<a name="40916-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>I have had a projection from the Rural Housing Trust, which is the leading developer of small schemes of affordable housing in villages in England&#151;that is, settlements of fewer than 1,500 people. The trust has been working with such villages since 1976. Since that time it has produced nearly 3,000 units of accommodation in 300 villages spread over 33 counties. It works at a small and appropriate scale for the size of village it works in, down to as few as two or three in an area such as Studland in Dorset, for example, where there is no such thing as affordable housing even for people earning probably &#163;100,000 a year. If you are on a normal salary it would be hopeless. So three affordable houses in that area were really meaningful.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>The trust&#039;s projection&#151;which I want to bring to the attention of the Minister&#151;is that over the next few years 8,000 small villages will need 50,000 new homes. That is in quite small settlements of under 1,500. I am very anxious that an innovative grant such as this is not going to make rural areas lose out. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_264"></a>
<a name="40916-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   I support the spirit of the amendment and do so as someone who, about 34 years ago founded a fairly small&#151;now almost medium-sized&#151;rural village housing association. Had that not been done, the village where most of the houses owned by the association stand, would almost certainly have been totally gentrified and passed beyond the means of the local inhabitants&#151;the sons and daughters of local residents.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>I might add that our last housing association scheme took five to seven years from start to completion&#151;due to shortage of funds, planning difficulties, other housing associations going bankrupt and numerous other problems. The Committee will realise that this is   extremely uphill work. I recommend to the Government the point made by the amendment. I do not necessarily expect them to adopt it as it stands, but could we at least be told that the policy of the Housing Corporation will be in accordance with the sense of the amendment? That would be of great benefit.

<p><a name="st_265"></a>
<a name="40916-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I could almost say, &quot;yes&quot; to both speeches. We are completely at one regarding the intention of both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. I make no bones about that. I do not wish even to be nit-picking about the amendment, but, as it is drafted, it could have a perverse effect if there was only one application in terms of percentages of bids&#151;for example, if there was a poor bid that did not stack up. But that is not the thrust of the amendment. The thrust is so that the small settlements and rural hamlets do not lose out on what we hope is an innovative scheme for providing social housing in another direction.

<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>I want to reassure the Committee that funding for affordable housing will be allocated in line with the priorities identified through the regional housing strategy process. But it must not be forgotten that part of that process is that regional housing boards must ensure that they have engaged with rural stakeholders and that the final product has been rural-proofed.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>When I was Minister for Housing&#151;Keith Hill now holds that post&#151;we were visited by Alun Michael and his associates from Defra to ensure that our policies and their practical operation were rural-proofed. We already have a programme for small settlements below 3,000 involving the Housing Corporation; but I take on board what the noble Baroness said regarding the smaller ones. We would not want them to be missed out of this innovative scheme. Obviously, business cases will have to be put forward; but the main thrust is that this is not an urban policy, but a national housing policy.
</p>

<a name="40916-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>A quarter of the population of the country lives in non-urban, rural areas&#151;millions of people living in small hamlets, small villages and towns. We do not want them and their families driven out due to a lack of affordable housing. We are very keen to address that. We have stepped up the Housing Corporation programme only slightly, but we have stepped it up. We want to ensure that those areas also share in the new policy.

cancelled engagements in Oxford and York to be here, I am afraid that I shall detain noble Lords for a short while on the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>This is concerned with the intentions of Clause 190 to award to other bodies the social housing grant, and other grants which have hitherto been available to only registered social landlords&#151;principally to private sector house builders. The issues here were not the subject of debate in the other place and I am glad, therefore, that this discussion accords with the views of the Minister that debates in this Chamber are most valuable when they pick up on new and original issues not previously debated. I remind your Members of the Committee of my earlier declaration of interest as chief executive of a registered social landlord, the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust. I have been involved with the measures surrounding grants to housing associations and regulation of housing associations for well over 30 years.
<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="40916-38_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>The object for the Government in taking the power to make grants to bodies that are not registered social landlords&#151;in other words, not housing associations&#151;is to increase competition, so that the amount of money available for social housing can be made to go further. Plans have already been announced for setting aside &#163;200 million from next year&#039;s funds for housing associations, for which house builders and other developers will be able to compete.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>If Clause 190 were to remain as it is in the Bill, my contention is that the medium to long-term consequences of this measure would be higher costs to the taxpayer, poorer outcomes for tenants and local communities, and consequently a deterioration in the public perceptions and acceptability of new housing for lower income households. I suspect that the only benefits would be very short-term, superficial savings, which all concerned would regret later on.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>At present, when the Housing Corporation decides on the bodies to which it should award social housing grants, it has considerable choice. Today&#039;s housing associations compete fiercely with one another for the available grants and bids far exceed the resources available. Indeed, some have argued that this competition can be too intense, putting pressure on housing associations to cut corners. Certainly, the housing associations making bids invariably expect to operate at a loss for each new development for many years, because the rents they will receive will not match the outgoings in repaying loans and managing and maintaining the property.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>However, the established housing associations can cover the losses by drawing on the surpluses they obtain from properties that they developed 10 or 20   years earlier, where rents will have risen while mortgage payments will have remained relatively constant, or indeed where mortgages have been fully repaid. My own housing association, for example, has debt-free properties built 50 and even 100 years ago.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1440"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1440</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>Private sector house builders or developers would of course find it much more difficult to carry losses for several years, because they do not have a pool of older properties where rental income achieves surpluses. So why would house builders wish to move away from the building of homes for sale and embark upon provision of social housing for rent or even provision of shared ownership housing, which is partly for rent and partly for ownership? Very few have a cash flow that would make it easy for them to suffer deficits for several years, even if they are predicting long-term capital gains in the more distant future. Even fewer have any experience in providing rented homes for families on low incomes, with all the specialist skills that this implies.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>However, there are circumstances in which direct provision of rented housing would suit the house builders. It is likely to be a condition of planning consent for all new developments that some social housing is provided. Of course, if social housing grants are available, normally there will be plenty of housing associations willing to take on the social rented provision so that house builders can perform their usual function of developing a site, selling and moving on to the next, without the ongoing commitments and hassles of owning any rented stock.

</p>

<a name="40916-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>Partnerships between house builders and housing associations are now the order of the day and the two parties are learning how best to operate these partnerships successfully. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published a couple of reports on ways in which contractual relationships between house builders and housing associations can work to best effect. The great majority of house builders will much prefer to continue with current arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>There are, however, occasions when house builders can find no housing association that wishes to work with them in taking on the rented element required by the planners. My housing association, the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust, has turned down approaches from house builders because their plans have been unacceptable. Builders have wanted us to produce rented homes in a segregated part of their site, even with a separate access, in the worst position&#151;for example, as a barrier between the owners and a noisy road or next to the gas works. We would refuse to be involved if we could not provide the rented homes &quot;pepper-potted&quot; across the site, avoiding the stigma of separate social housing, which can completely undermine the social purposes of a new development. With direct access to social housing grants, house builders might think that they could get away with practices that most housing associations would find deplorable. But I hope that the Housing Corporation would take a robust view and refuse to pay grant in any such cases.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>The other circumstance in which house builders might feel that the only way they can satisfy the conditions for planning consent and draw the usual profits from the housing for sale is where the local authority is seeking a higher proportion of social housing than the housing associations feel they can achieve with the funds available. Although house builders want to keep the element of social housing&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1441"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1441</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from which no profits are likely&#151;to a minimum in order to get the whole development through the planning system, they may have to offer a higher proportion of affordable homes than the housing associations will attempt. What form would the efficiency gains take that would allow the profit-making house builders to produce more homes than the not-for-profit registered social landlords? Since the income that they will receive from rents will be the same, they will have to make the savings by reducing ongoing expenditure. They could do that if their costs for managing the property were lower than for housing associations, but exactly the reverse is likely, as they will have to engage private managing agents willing to take on social housing or, more likely, find housing associations willing to do the management for them. They will then have to add 17.5 per cent VAT&#151;a tax which housing associations managing the homes themselves do not pay.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>Nor are house builders likely to save money by borrowing at lower interest rates than housing associations. House builders cannot offer security on other properties in the way that housing associations, with a stock of older homes, can command. All the major housing associations borrow on highly competitive terms because the risks in lending to them are so low. So far, although housing associations have borrowed some &#163;40 billion, lenders have never lost money.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>The construction costs of an identical building are unlikely to be lower whether the homes are built for a housing association or a developer or house builder&#151;unless, that is, the latter is prepared to accept lower standards, and that is where the problem lies. The Housing Corporation specifies scheme development standards, and assurances from the Minister make it clear that naturally the same standards, on paper, would apply to house builders seeking grants. But there is a wide variation in how the same product is produced&#151;for example, in relation to the quality of all the components, from door handles to roofs.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>As the Minister makes clear in the helpful notes that he has provided on the clause, building for rent requires a more robust construction than building for sale. Homes for rent will be fully occupied from day one, while the homes for sale will have spare rooms, and a new house purchaser is much more likely to have the resources and inclination to engage in constant DIY repair work than the tenant, and so the rented home must withstand greater wear and tear. Later costs will be borne by the landlord and not the occupier if component parts wear out. Over the life of a property, a cheaper initial article will cost more, but the Housing Corporation cannot be expected to measure accurately the life-cycle costs at the outset without fully inspecting all the properties on site being developed by private sector house builders in a way that is currently quite unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_603"></a>Housing associations that have bought properties off the peg from house builders&#151;properties that, of course, comply with the Housing Corporation scheme development standards&#151;have discovered that they bring problems over the medium to longer term and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1442"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1442</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they have discovered the true cost in higher maintenance costs. Important work on that issue, carried out for housing associations at the University of Dundee, has increased our understanding of the importance of the more robust construction of rented homes. Housing associations are in for the long haul and they know that they will regret it later if they try to make savings in the short term, just to secure grants in a competitive situation.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_604"></a>Moreover, I fear that those short-term savings&#151;where the bid from the house builder is preferred over that of the registered social landlord&#151;will be only the beginning of the problems caused by Clause 190. After the homes are built, and irrespective of higher maintenance costs that are likely to emerge, there is a range of other disadvantages in giving public money to unregulated profit-making companies.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_605"></a>The Minister has indicated that appropriate parts of   the regulations currently applying to housing associations would be applied equally to other bodies that obtain grants. Those requirements would be enforced under the terms of the grant. In so far as that goes, the Minister&#039;s comments are very reassuring and very helpful, but in two respects I fear that the deal secured from the house builder, compared with that provided through the housing association, will be very inferior.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_606"></a>First, there are obligations on housing associations which it would seem impossible to require from unregulated providers. Secondly, in respect of those requirements which are imposed on house builders or other non-RSLs, it would seem virtually impossible for the regulator of the Housing Corporation to enforce compliance. Examples of the former relate to the roles that housing associations play beyond the simple management and maintenance of the homes that they own. They need to provide extra support to vulnerable tenants to tackle anti-social behaviour and to create extra communal and social facilities; they employ welfare rights and advice workers; they ensure tenant participation in decision making; and they often participate with other agencies in the support for renewal of a whole neighbourhood.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_607"></a>A house builder providing a few rented homes here and there cannot be expected to take on all these other functions. Although I entirely accept the assurances of the Minister that grants will be given to house builders only on condition that all the basic legal requirements for tenants are covered, that is only part of the story in terms of what society receives from supporting registered social landlords. The tenants of unregulated new landlords will not benefit from all the extra welfare and social input that they could expect from a housing association landlord.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a>The second half of those anxieties relates to the difficulties for the Housing Corporation in enforcing those conditions that are written into the original grant; for example, the corporation periodically requires housing associations to upgrade the standards of the homes that they built some years before. Currently, housing associations have to invest in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1443"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1443</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

properties so that they can reach new decent homes standards. In future properties will need to achieve a higher version of those standards.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_609"></a>Although the rents from any single scheme may not be sufficient to achieve surpluses to fund such upgrading, the housing associations can still pay for the improvements by pooling the surpluses from their older stock. How will the private developers and house builders feel about finding the funds later for such upgrading and what happens if they have not set aside sufficient to undertake even the predictable major repairs that are bound to become necessary? Without the regular regulatory inspections from the Audit Commission, to which housing associations are subject, how will the Housing Corporation keep tabs on what happens to the properties and their occupiers as the years go by?
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a>Meanwhile, in the private sector there will undoubtedly be the usual mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies and the corporation will constantly need to be stepping in to ensure that the terms of the original grant continue to be enforced. That sounds like an expensive and, in some cases, doomed task which contrasts with the ongoing oversight of the regulated, registered social landlords.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a>My final, and in some respects my most severe criticism of the proposed measure, relates to the difficulties that will be encountered in capturing the equity appreciation in the grant-aided properties if and when they are sold in the years to come. I recall the Notting Hill Housing Trust buying and modernising homes in north Kensington in the 1970s for &#163;25,000 per house. Those same houses are now worth 100 times that sum&#151;over &#163;2 million. All that increase in value is held within the not-for-profit social housing sector. If the Notting Hill Housing Trust sells a property, the proceeds will be re-used for the social purposes of the trust. It is not helpful simply to say that the original grant must be repaid. In my Notting Hill example, that grant might have represented &#163;20,000, leaving over &#163;2 million as equity appreciation&#151;that is, capital gains for the owner.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a>I realise that the Minister would like the terms of the original grant to ensure that the whole of the capital gains to the house builder can be recycled for social purposes, which is right, but it will be extraordinarily difficult to guarantee that outcome years from now. There is a real danger that the equity in subsidised property, which has made today&#039;s housing associations strong and financially secure and enabled them to undertake a range of important social functions, will not be captured where grants are paid to profit-making companies.
<a name="time_29"></a>
<a name="40916-38_time1"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-38_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a>Since I have been unable to say anything positive about the clause, except to express appreciation to the Minister for making it clear that some of the more extreme concerns about its implementation would be moderated by important conditions in the terms of grant aid, it might seem my purposes would be better <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1444"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1444</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

served by arguing that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. That proposition, put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, may be the safest option, but I recognise that there are some rare circumstances where grants can justifiably go to bodies that are not registered social landlords. Some charities might be keen to perform in a similar way to RSLs, and might not want to register with the Housing Corporation because they have only one or two small projects in mind and wish to avoid the full regulatory weight that registration would bring. There are the arm&#039;s-length management organisations the Minister mentioned, established by local authorities, which may seek social housing grants for new work. With these so-called ALMOs, the property remains in the ownership of the council, the organisations have a public service ethos and &quot;good landlordism&quot; can be expected, even though there is no registration with the Housing Corporation. There may be other worthy examples to accommodate such special circumstances, although I doubt there will be many.
</p>

<a name="40916-38_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_614"></a>The clause could be preserved with amendments that gave legal weight to the Government&#039;s intentions that a level playing field be created for non-registered social landlords, as for the registered social landlords. Amendment No. 231A seeks to enshrine in law a requirement that each of the key rights that apply to tenants in the homes of registered social landlords and the key elements of the regulation of social landlords are applied equally when non-RSLs provide the new subsidised homes. Even though I fear the enforcement of those measures will be difficult, they will provide a modicum of reassurance if grants for social housing are to be given to unregistered, unregulated private companies. I beg to move.

raised. Let me put it this way: a government who are legislating on housing and do not listen to the noble Lord, Lord Best, are asking for trouble.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a>Amendment No. 231A would put on the face of the Bill a requirement for the Housing Corporation to ensure that tenants of non-registered social landlords were given the same protection as tenants of registered social landlords (RSLs). The Government wish to ensure an equality of outcome for residents, tenants and prospective tenants of RSLs and non-RSLs. However, the amendment would unnecessarily restrict the Housing Corporation&#039;s flexibility to shape a competition and to amend conditions in the light of experience. It is also unnecessary&#151;this is my fallback because it is the key area&#151;given the order-making power that the Secretary of State will have to ensure that any key risk areas, such as the interests of prospective and actual tenants or occupiers, are addressed.

</p>

<a name="40916-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_617"></a>We would expect the Housing Corporation to ensure, through grant conditions, equivalent standards of management by non-registered social landlords to those provided by registered social landlords, subject to the regulatory code. That would include expectations about equality of opportunity, rent levels, consultation with tenants, maintenance, security of tenure and accepting nominations from local authorities.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_618"></a>In addition, the corporation is looking at ensuring, through grant conditions, that appropriate sections of the Charter for Housing Association Applicants and Residents will also apply to non-registered social landlords. Those are likely to include: written tenancy agreements, succession rights, information about rents and service charges, repair and maintenance services, and complaints handling, including referral to the Independent Housing Ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_619"></a>Amendment No. 231A would also put in the Bill a requirement for the Housing Corporation to ensure that non-RSLs were subject to the same regulation in respect of disposal of property, use of grant and recycling of grant. We believe that that does not take into account some fundamental differences between RSLs and non-RSLs.

<a name="40916-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_620"></a>When an RSL sells a property, it is allowed to reinvest any surplus according to its own permissible purposes and must reinvest the grant for social housing within three years or refund it to the Housing Corporation. That works because the regulatory system controls the use of grant and surpluses, and because registered social landlords have specific social purposes. These statutory arrangements do not translate well to commercial profit-distributing organisations so we believe that the Housing Corporation will have to address in conditions how receipts should be reinvested or, more likely, how they should be refunded to the corporation for it to recycle.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_621"></a>We recognise that that is a crucial value-for-money issue. It is not our intention that funds will be unfairly lost for reinvestment in social housing. The Housing Corporation is looking at ways of ensuring that the benefit of the equity growth in property is retained by government or recycled for social housing purposes. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1446"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1446</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The Government will in any case keep a watching brief over conditions applied to grants to non-RSLs. The clause already provides a safety net to ensure that, where we think that a specific condition needs to be prescribed or dealt with in a condition, the Secretary of State can, by means of an order, require that to happen.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_622"></a>I shall now address some of the noble Lord&#039;s questions. How would we ensure that public money is protected and any windfall from increased property prices is reinvested in social housing? I have explained the position that we recognise this as a crucial value-for-money issue. It is absolutely fundamental to registered social landlords and the housing association movement. We do not intend that funds will be unfairly lost for reinvestment in social housing. We are looking for ways to make that work.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_623"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, asked how private developers would be required to raise standards in the future. If long-term management is passed to a registered social landlord, it will be possible to apply new conditions to the normal regulatory processes. For non-registered social landlords, it will not be possible to impose new conditions, although that might be achieved through renegotiation with any non-registered social landlord provider or under a mechanism that provides compensation for such variation.

</p>

<a name="40916-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_624"></a>As the noble Lord said, there is an issue in that the corporation will struggle to enforce conditions. Obviously, this is a new field. Undoubtedly, enforcement would be simpler if the long-term management was transferred to a registered social landlord. The noble Lord, Lord Best, raised the issue of the extra 17.5 per cent floating around. I have not been briefed on that, but no doubt we will return to the issue. If that happened, it would be subject to regulation&#151;that is, the transfer to an RSL. In other circumstances, if the Housing Corporation feels that the grant conditions have not been met or are not being fully complied with, it will ultimately be able to revert to the courts to enforce the conditions. Obviously, it is hoped that a satisfactory outcome could be achieved in almost all cases through discussion before such a sanction was deemed necessary.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_625"></a>On the conditions of grant, this begs the question in some ways&#151;if everything negative about the clause that the noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to was true, you might ask who in their right mind would apply for the grant, bearing in mind the onerous conditions that will have to be met. I am not saying that that is a get-out and that we have arranged this in such a way that we do not want anyone to apply. That is simply not true. However, the conditions of grant drawn up by the Housing Corporation will be expected to replicate for non-RSLs the design, construction and management standards that currently apply to registered social landlords receiving approved development programme funding.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>There is no intention that this measure&#151;this clause&#151;will reduce quality. I take that to mean the quality that RSLs&#151;housing associations&#151;work to now, for the very reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Best, raised. Building a home that is to be permanently rented for a tenant in the social sector has different <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1447"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1447</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

requirements from those of owner-occupation. Generally, the space is used to capacity more and one has to consider the maintenance issues that the noble Lord raised. If we ignore that we are, as the noble Lord said, building up real problems for the future.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>However, as a longstop, the Secretary of State is able to exercise control over the conditions of grant imposed by the Housing Corporation. The Secretary of State will have an order-making power to require the Housing Corporation to impose specific conditions and prescribe matters about which the Housing Corporation is to prepare and impose conditions, and any particular effects that such conditions are to achieve. This might be used to address key risk areas such as the interests of actual and potential tenants or occupiers and the public money or the asset that it has funded.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, raised the issue of value for money. There is a competition&#151;the money has been top-sliced. The competition will be open to both registered social landlords and non-registered social landlords. Bodies will receive the grant only if they offer value for money. Any non-registered social landlord offering worse value for money than a registered social landlord will not receive any grant.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_629"></a>The intention of the clause is to see whether we can widen the pool of potential providers of social housing; drive efficiency and improve value for money; and encourage innovation and creativity in this sector, while creating a level playing field between registered social landlords and non-registered social landlords in terms of outcomes for tenants and prospective tenants.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_630"></a>It was not my intention to throw a bucket of whitewash over the issue of those who might apply for the grant. I wanted to give as robust, clear, firm and black and white an answer as possible to many of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Best, so that there can be no misunderstanding of the clause&#039;s intention.
</p>

<a name="40916-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_631"></a>Between today, when we will finish the Committee stage, and when we come back on Report, one or two major conferences will take place. I do not mean the party political conferences, but one or two others which my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister will address. I want it to be absolutely clear to his audiences that we have a robust line on this which fits very well with some of the issues that the noble Lord, Lord Best, has raised. Nevertheless, I suspect that we will come back to this on Report.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_33"></a><br>
   &quot;STANDARD FOR SOCIAL HOUSING

<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State shall ensure that by 2016 all social housing shall as far as is reasonably practicable have insulation, heating and ventilation standards that are at least equivalent to those required in newly built homes by the building regulations for the time being in force.


<br>
(2)   For the avoidance of doubt the standards referred to above shall include the following provisions, namely that&#151;


<br>
(a)   there must be a heating system that is economical and efficient and which is capable of heating the whole dwelling to a comfortable level in normal weather conditions at a cost that is affordable to the occupant; and


<br>
(b)   any property to which this section applies must achieve a SAP rating of no lower than 65.


<br>
(3)   In this section &quot;social housing&quot; means housing let by a registered social landlord or a local housing authority.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_276"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall briefly explain the rationale of the amendment. Under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, the Government have a duty to end fuel poverty. The mechanism for doing that in social housing is the decent homes standard. However, the Government have set the standard so low that it will not end fuel poverty. The Government will thus be in breach of the law, as well as failing to achieve the target set in the fuel poverty strategy.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_637"></a>It is clear that the decent homes standard for social housing has a very serious defect. The defect&#151;the thermal insulation standard for social housing&#151;is set too low and will fail to deliver on the legal obligation to end fuel poverty.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_638"></a> Upgrading insulation works are triggered on those houses that do not comply with the current standard. That sounds perfectly sound until we see that a large number of homes that do comply with the standard are still in fuel poverty.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_639"></a>A National Energy Action study of the Stockton Warm Zone indicated that 39 per cent of fuel-poor tenants live in properties which meet the energy efficiency standards contained in the decent homes standard. That represents an enormous number of social housing tenants who live in properties that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1449"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1449</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

comply with the decent homes standard and so do not qualify for upgrade works under the standard, which means that they will be left in fuel poverty.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_640"></a>What of homes that do not comply even with the current standard? The latest figures show that more than a million non-decent homes fail the current low standard on thermal insulation grounds. The current policy is to bring those homes up to the decent homes standard&#151;a standard that will not, as I have explained, guarantee that they will be removed from fuel poverty.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_641"></a> Amendment No. 232 would therefore rectify the situation by requiring that the standards in social housing equate with those in the building regulations,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;as far as is reasonably practicable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_642"></a>The caveat is necessary because, for instance, it is not practicable to require a house with no cavity wall to have cavity wall insulation.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_643"></a>New Clause 3 requires that all social housing should be brought up to a Standard Assessment Procedure rating of 65. Support for that rating approach came from the ODPM Select Committee Report on the decent homes standard of 7 May.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_644"></a>The Government are under a legal duty to end fuel poverty under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. If they adopt the current decent homes standard and upgrade social housing to a standard that does not comply with the law, the result will be that a further package of works will have to be undertaken on those homes at a later date. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_277"></a>
<a name="40916-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The noble Baroness has been commendably brief. When I looked at my speaking notes on the amendment last night, they extended to 35 paragraphs&#151;drafted for me by the excellent staff in my department who have supported me on the Bill. I pointed out to them that at the time of day that it would come up it might be a bit on the long side, so we have chopped it down a bit.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_645"></a>Amendment No. 232 would improve the insulation, heating and ventilation standards of existing social housing stock. While we support the general objectives of the amendment, we do not agree that it is the appropriate way to pursue the issue. The Government are fully committed to those objectives by ensuring that all social housing meets the decent homes standard. I do not quite remember the decent homes standard being in force before 1997. I do not think that there was a decent homes standard then. It is a standard that we have set for ourselves and we are happy to be measured by it, because millions of people are benefiting from it. We have set ourselves the goal of eradicating fuel poverty for all vulnerable households by 2010.

</p>

<a name="40916-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_646"></a>The Bill already contains measures&#151;not all the measures necessary&#151;relating to the energy efficiency of homes. Home information packs will include an energy efficiency assessment that will set out how energy efficient the property is and provide information on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1450"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1450</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

measures to improve it. There is no doubt about it; the energy efficiency of housing in this country will improve as a result of that.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_647"></a>The new housing health and safety rating system&#151;I think that was in Part 1 of the Bill, which we considered a long time ago&#151;will enable authorities to assess the health and safety impact of a range of hazards, including hazards from cold, damp and mould, and to take appropriate action. The best way of dealing with a hazard from cold is to make the dwelling more energy efficient. Not only will local authorities use the housing health and safety rating system as an enforcement tool but they will also be able to use it as a means of assessing risk and prioritising action where it is most needed in the social sector.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_648"></a>To be defined as decent, a home must meet the current statutory minimum standard for housing, be in a reasonable state of repair, have reasonably modern facilities and services and provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort. There are hundreds of thousands of currently local authority homes that have had modern bathrooms and kitchens under the Decent Homes programme. Tenants almost literally have new houses&#151;but this clause is about the thermal side and I shall stick to that.

</p>

<a name="40916-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_649"></a> To meet the thermal comfort criterion, a home must have efficient heating as well as effective insulation. By ensuring that homes are warm and dry and have reasonably modern facilities, we are delivering improved quality of life and reducing health inequalities, fuel poverty and child poverty. A typical social housing tenant living in a home with these measures will not be in fuel poverty. Those that are in fuel poverty after the installation of effective insulation and efficient heating&#151;for instance, because their income is very low&#151;will be in a better position than before, as they will have to spend less to heat their home.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_650"></a>However, we have to be realistic about that. We cannot accept the notion that heating systems should be capable of heating a dwelling to a level affordable to the occupant because affordability depends on an occupant&#039;s income. In instances of households with very low incomes, energy efficiency improvements alone will not be sufficient to allow a household to heat the home affordably. In such cases, income-related measures will be required. So while we are already committed to delivering effective heating, we cannot guarantee occupants&#039; incomes and therefore this provision is not only unacceptable but is also unworkable. One can go so far with the property but at a certain point one has to deal with the income of the person living in it, which we do through the benefits and tax credit systems.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_651"></a>To sum up, the Government are committed to improving living conditions for the poorest members of our communities. We are improving the heating and insulation of at least 1.3 million homes in the social sector. A massive exercise has been taking place by freeing up and using the capital receipts that had been locked away for years under the previous Tory government. We fully accept the right to buy, but we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1451"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1451</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

then use the money from right to buy to build new social housing or to modernise the existing social housing.
</p>

<a name="40916-40_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_652"></a> We are providing winter fuel payments to most people aged 60 or over. Because we need to reach everybody, it goes to some people who do not need it. We fully accept that, but that way we reach the people who do need it. We are already committed to further amendments to Part L of the building regulations to increase further the energy efficiency of new dwellings and of existing ones when owners propose to carry out alterations and extension works, which we have debated in this House before. The proposed clause would impose a burden that we do not think is cost-effective and that is not practical in the way in which it is drafted. I fully accept that we need to raise these issues and I am not knocking the fact that the amendment was on the Order Paper.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_34"></a><br>
   &quot;SUITABILITY OF ACCOMMODATION

<br>
   In section 206 of the Housing Act 1996 (c. 52) (discharge of functions by local authorities), after subsection (2) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(3)   Accommodation will not be deemed suitable unless the applicant has been allowed a reasonable opportunity of viewing the accommodation offered in potential discharge of housing functions.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_280"></a> The noble Baroness said: This amendment is about the suitability of accommodation, with which we propose to deal by adding a provision to the 1996 Act. The purpose of the amendment is to reverse the effect of this year&#039;s decision of the Court of Appeal in the <i>London Borough of</i> <i>Newham</i> v <i>Khatun and others</i>. That decision was that an applicant for accommodation as homeless to whom a duty has been accepted under Part 7 of the 1996 Act can be required to accept accommodation offered in discharge of the duty&#151;and this is the point&#151;without being given the opportunity to view it.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_654"></a>By the council&#039;s scheme, which the Court of Appeal decision in effect franked, if the applicant refused to accept an offer, the council would regard its duty as discharged and cease to secure accommodation for an applicant. Applicants include pregnant women, families with infant children and the vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_655"></a>The code of guidance issued in July 2002 by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister implies that applicants should be allowed an opportunity to view, by advising that housing authorities,

</p>

<a name="40916-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_657"></a>The judge at first instance observed that the policy requires the applicant to enter into binding legal obligations in relation to a property sight unseen. In addition to that, the council is deprived of the applicants&#039; views on the property, which the court rightly observed would be relevant to a decision as to the suitability if the applicant was able to give them. An applicant can request a statutory review of suitability, which the council would conduct, whether the offer is accepted or not, but at best the applicant will have had to accept the property before or at the same time as requesting the review, and to take up occupation before the review is completed. If the review is successful, the council will have to offer another property&#151;which means one more move, unnecessary disruption for the applicant, and the council spending time on the formal statutory review process, which it could have avoided.

</p>

<a name="40916-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_658"></a>The justification for the policy is the need to remove applicants and their families from bed and breakfast accommodation as quickly as possible. Obviously, that is desirable, but the brief time required for an inspection can hardly cause a significant delay. I have referred already to the confusion, distress and so on that is caused by the policy, and the potential for avoidable error on the part of the council. The amendment allows for occasions when an inspection is not practicable by referring to a &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_659"></a>This is not the first time that we have addressed the issue. During the passage of the Homelessness Bill in 2001, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, who was then Housing Minister, accepted the concern and pointed to the protection of the code of guidance. Shelter, which is not the only organisation to have brought the matter to our attention, is concerned that the decision of the Court of Appeal would undermine the code.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_660"></a>I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the amendment in these precise terms, it is something that can be taken away and worked on so that it is right technically. There is so much in this Bill that it would be a great pity not to use this opportunity to tweak a provision of a previous statute which is going slightly wrong and get it right. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_281"></a>
<a name="40916-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I shall try to do justice to the amendment. It is an important issue, but we must also ensure that we are living in the real world as well.

We share those concerns.

</p>

<a name="40916-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_661"></a>That is partly why, for example, we introduced a target of reducing to zero the number of families with children accommodated under the homelessness legislation in bed and breakfast hotels and similar establishments for more than six weeks. That challenging target was met outright by 95 per cent of local housing authorities by the due date of 31 March this year. There were some 26 families.

<p><a name="stpa_662"></a>In other words, when the target was announced, 6,000 children were moved out of bed and breakfast. It is true that some of them may have gone into temporary accommodation, but they have gone into a home of their own where they have a room, a kitchen and they can have their friends round. They are out of bed and breakfast accommodation. That was an incredible achievement by local government of all shades and we are seeking to maintain that figure having hit the target. We keep a constant watch on matters and we have since legislated so that if bed and breakfast accommodation has to be used it cannot be used for longer than six weeks.

<p><a name="stpa_663"></a>We are also setting new accommodation standards for bed and breakfast accommodation and will be consolidating existing standards that apply to accommodation generally, when we issue a revision of the homelessness code of guidance for local authorities<i> </i>in the near future.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_664"></a> The Government want local housing authorities to adopt customer-centred approaches to the allocation of social housing, which give applicants more of a say in choosing where they live. While local housing authorities are under no statutory obligation to offer a choice of accommodation to applicants when they make an allocation of accommodation under Part 6, they are strongly encouraged to do so.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_665"></a>Indeed, the Government have set a target for all housing authorities to have adopted a choice-based approach to letting their long term accommodation by the year 2010. Furthermore, we believe that, where possible, choice-based lettings schemes should include homeless households. Offering choice is an important aspect of enabling the creation of sustainable communities.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_666"></a>However, the homelessness legislation provides a safety net for individuals who find themselves in a housing crisis. In areas of high housing demand where affordable accommodation is in short supply, it would not be practical for authorities to be required to offer a choice of such accommodation, or to take fully into account an applicant&#039;s preferences.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_667"></a>The type of accommodation used to discharge such a duty could include a place in a hostel; an offer of a non-secure tenancy in a house or flat, either in the authority&#039;s own stock or leased from another landlord; a direct tenancy with another landlord or, as a last resort, a place in a bed and breakfast establishment.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_668"></a>It will not always be practical for an applicant to view the accommodation beforehand; to be frank, there may be little point if no choice is being offered. It is important that the accommodation meets the minimum standards and is suitable for the applicant. In any particular case it is for the authority to decide whether the accommodation is suitable for the applicant.

</p>

<a name="40916-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_669"></a>In the main, where it is practical to do so, people, including the homeless, should have a choice under a choice-based lettings programme. Homeless applicants are using a different route for housing from people waiting in the queue or for an exchange. We need to make sure that their homeless circumstances are taken <br>&nbsp;<br>

into account. We are making sure that they have a roof. There are different ways of doing that. Many authorities are introducing policies, which we greatly applaud, helping to prevent homelessness.

</p>

<a name="40916-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_670"></a>Where interim temporary accommodation has been secured by a local authority in discharge of its Part 7 duties, it is not possible to give people a choice in the normal sense of the word. This is crisis accommodation provided to cater for urgent needs of homeless applicants, many of whom would otherwise be living in unreasonable circumstances and some even sleeping rough.
</p>

<a name="40916-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_671"></a>We have cut rough sleeping by 70 per cent. They are not all in permanent long-term accommodation, but they are not on the streets. That figure is checked frequently. I have been out with the team myself not all night but late at night to see the work that goes on. We have cut rough sleeping by 70 per cent. We have removed families with children from bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and we now seek, through an increase in the housing programme, to address the provision of more social accommodation. In the mean time, for crisis accommodation it is not always possible to offer the choice that others would get using the normal route for housing.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_35"></a><br>
   &quot;GENERAL PRINCIPLE AS TO THE EXERCISE OF FUNCTIONS

<br>
(1)   In the exercise of their functions under Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of this Act, any national authority, local housing authority or residential property tribunal shall, so far as is practicable, seek to ensure that the nature and extent of any works required to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1455"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1455</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

carried out in respect of any premises or any facilities equipment or amenities to be provided in connections with the premises or standards to be complied with shall be no more than the minimum necessary commensurate with the health and safety of the occupiers or likely occupiers of the premises concerned.


<br>
(2)   In determining how to exercise any function for the purposes of subsection (1) each national authority, local housing authority and residential property tribunal shall have regard to the following&#151;


<br>
(a)   the age, character and locality of the premises concerned,


<br>
(b)   the cost of carrying out any works or providing any facility, equipment or amenity,


<br>
(c)   the nature and extent of any works to be carried out or facility, equipment or amenity to be provided in such premises,


<br>
(d)   the existing structure and design and layout of the premises,


<br>
(e)   how any works, facilities or amenities will affect the matters referred to in paragraph (d),


<br>
(f)   whether or not the premises are a listed building or located within a conservation area within the meaning of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 (c. 8).


<br>
(3)   Any reference to a &quot;function&quot; includes a &quot;power&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_286"></a>The noble Baroness said: I think that it has been the Government&#039;s intention all the way through to ensure that there was a light-touch regulation in relation to HMO licensing. We seem to be drifting back in the Bill, but there we are. However, as things stand at the moment it does not look quite so light-touch.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_677"></a>The implementation of the Bill lies in the hands of local authorities. While barriers are breaking down, historically, landlords have somewhat regarded local authorities and their environmental health officers as hostile to the private rented sector. Landlords sometimes feel that local authorities discriminate against them, not always applying the same strict standards to their own properties.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_678"></a>Throughout the debate on the Bill so far, the Government have acknowledged that the private rented sector is something of a cottage industry. With the &quot;buy-to-let&quot; boom, a majority of landlords own fewer than three properties. For example, many parents have in recent years bought properties in student areas for their children to live in and let out the other rooms. They will be surprised to find that they will be brought into the licensing net with all the costs and regulation involved. It would not be unreasonable to suppose that complying with the criteria for licensing could amount to about &#163;10,000 a house. There is, therefore, considerable risk of disinvestment, if significant regulatory and cost burdens are placed on small landlords.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_679"></a>Prior to the passing of the Housing Act 1988, the private rented sector was dying on its feet. Since then, the tide has turned but large-scale residential property operators are notable by their absence from the sector. By and large, it is reliant upon individual investors, particularly the buy-to-let investor.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_680"></a>It is vital to recognise that many houses in multiple occupation provide relatively low cost affordable housing. If the requirements imposed upon them are over the top, they will be lost to the market. Over the last few years there has been a major loss of HMO <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1456"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accommodation, particularly in London, because owners have converted them back to flats. That problem will be exacerbated if excessive requirements are placed on landlords.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_681"></a>It is important that there be a statement of principle in the Bill, so as to ensure that those involved in carrying it into effect have a signpost by which to work. That is particularly significant as regards the residential property tribunals that will deal with appeals as well as the national authorities when setting standards.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_682"></a> The clause would ensure minimum measures, so as to impose the minimal financial burden, but always commensurate with the health and safety of occupiers. The clause then goes on to set out the factors that should be considered when any decision is taken, whether in relation to the setting of standards, enforcement action or appeals. It is vital to take into account the age and character of a property, otherwise one has a situation of new wine in old bottles. One cannot easily bring Victorian and Edwardian properties up to a modern standard. Similarly, there are problems in dealing with listed buildings, where a balance must be struck with the historical features of the building. The cost of any work is an important factor to ensure that it is not unreasonable. At the end of the day, if it is excessive, it will be passed on in higher rents. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_287"></a>
<a name="40916-42_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Amendment No. 233 would promote the principle that any requirement on landlords should be no more than is necessary to ensure the health and safety of the occupiers, or likely occupiers, of the premises. I think I understand what lies behind the amendment, and acknowledge that none of us wants local authorities to impose unreasonable requirements on landlords to carry out unnecessary works. I cannot support the amendment, however.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_683"></a>The items listed in subsection (2) of the new clause would, if necessary, be more appropriately dealt with in guidance for the purposes of Part 1 of the Bill. Clause 8 provides for guidance to be issued as to the exercise of Part 1 functions. Indeed, under Part 1, a local authority can serve a notice requiring works to be carried out only if they are necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupier. However, I do not agree that works cannot be required to provide or improve amenities in HMOs unless necessary for health and safety reasons. Licensing conditions must be able to be imposed to ensure that the HMO is reasonably suitable for multiple occupation, which, I think we could all agree, is more about decency and comfort than health and safety.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_684"></a>When we debated Part 2, I sensed a general agreement that, by and large, both sides of the House trusted local authorities to do things properly, and that they should be able to exercise their discretion in an appropriate way. To some extent, the amendment takes away that discretion. I have no reason at all to suppose that local authorities will not take into consideration the matters listed in subsection (2) (a) to (f) when determining whether or not to require works to amenity standards. But I do not think it is necessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1457"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to set this out as a statutory duty. Also, I do not think it is appropriate to direct a residential property tribunal in this regard. The whole point of the appeals procedure is to enable the tribunal to rehear the case and reach its own conclusion on the reasonableness, or not, of the original decision, having regard to all the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40916-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_685"></a>I can understand the spirit behind the amendment, and I can see some of the problems, but I do not think this is the best way to do it. It would probably end up being an abuse of the residential property tribunal. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, feels able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_288"></a>
<a name="40916-42_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. This may be something that we could come back to at the earlier stage of the Bill next time. I take his point about the guidance in Part 1, but we have got to be really careful&#151;and I know we are in a different part of the Bill now&#151;that the pressures we put with regard to houses in multiple occupation, particularly on landlords with a limited number of properties, are not so onerous that they simply give up and go away.

</p>

<a name="40916-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_709"></a>This clause is about the power of entry. As it stands a local authority can effectively send an authorised person to enter the home of an individual for the purpose of Clause 203, without seeking even the approval of a magistrate or some other judicial authority. Can the Minister say whether that is a new departure, because Amendments Nos. 238G and 238J specify that before such action can be taken the local authority must seek the authorisation of a warrant of a magistrate?
</p>

<a name="40916-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_710"></a>Amendment No. 238F is simply a probing amendment which has been pre-empted. Finally, Amendment No. 238K would remove from the armoury of the local authority the ability to leave recording equipment on any site it visited. I have to say that, reading between the lines, that gives enough legitimacy for a local authority to basically spy on and bug an individual in their accommodation. This would appear to be a worrying departure. We need from the Minister an understanding of what is required in terms of the powers of entry, so that we are not giving power of entry to any local authority person, whether authorised to be dealing with these matters or not. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_304"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   This group of amendments, as the noble Baroness said, seeks to limit access where a warrant has already been issued. I presume that this is not necessary when the owner is prepared to co-operate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_305"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   This amendment has nothing to do with a situation in which a warrant has been issued. It states that there should be no entry without a warrant. I think we are on the wrong side of the coin.
</p>




<p><a name="st_306"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendment is designed to prevent an authority entering premises without a warrant. I understand the point. I am not quite sure what the problem is, because I think that such powers have existed before but I wish to check that.
</p>

<a name="40916-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_711"></a> Specifically, Amendment No. 238K relates to entering premises to remove recording. No, I believe that what is being attacked here is a concern about eavesdropping. Is that correct?
</p>




<p><a name="st_307"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   There is a concern, first, about people, however prominent in the local authority, waltzing into other people&#039;s property. Secondly, there is a concern about leaving recording equipment for some reason&#151;however good they might think it is&#151;that could potentially bug the property. I cannot make it much clearer than that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_308"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The powers contained in Clause 203 give the local housing authority power of access where certain conditions are met. Representatives of the authority must have written authorisation setting out the purpose for which the entry is authorised and must give at least 24 hours notice to the owner or occupier of the premises they intend to enter.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1462"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1462</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_712"></a>Permission under the clause does not include a power to use force to enter and the power of entry includes entry for the purpose of taking samples. That is how it is framed, and it is also relevant to mention that Clause 204 enables a justice of the peace to issue a warrant for admission to premises, and that this includes power to enter by force, but only if necessary. The power is applicable, however, only when either entry under Clause 203 has been refused, or the property is empty and immediate access is necessary, or prior warning of entry is likely to negate the purpose of access. I understand the concerns, but there is sufficient qualification and hedging of the entry power so that the problem that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, sees is not so obvious.

</p>

<a name="40916-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_713"></a>In particular, the recording equipment referred to, which may well have triggered part of the concern in terms of eavesdropping and so on, is for recording levels of, for example, radon, or other harmful gases or particles. The inspector may need to leave the equipment&#151;I am sure the noble Baroness will be familiar with this sort of activity from her local government experience&#151;and return after a period of time, rather than take an immediate test and leave with the equipment. We do not want, in these circumstances, where there is an important issue of public health, to tie the hands of the inspector and prevent the inspector from acting effectively.

</p>

<a name="40916-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_714"></a> However, the inspector cannot simply leave equipment that records gases or particles without justification. I would like to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that we have hedged this power sufficiently. It is a matter of public protection and it is not a power that we would advance without all of those issues being at the forefront of our thinking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_309"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I am sorry that it is so late, because I would really wish to test the Minister on what he has said. Clause 203(4) states that before entering the premises the authorised person must give 24 hours&#039; notice to the owner of the premises or to the occupier, if any. The chances are that there will be somebody there. I will read what the Minister finally said when we got the thing right, but there is a real problem with people having the right to enter property&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_310"></a>
<a name="40916-44_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Would it help if between now and Report I sent the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, a note giving some further explanation? This is a benign power. I can understand, having heard the noble Baroness read the subsection, that there may be some concern that we are being over-zealous here, but that is not the intention. I think that I could probably reassure the noble Baroness in correspondence.

<p><a name="st_316"></a>The noble Lord said: This group contains 14 government amendments, in the middle of which is deposited one opposition amendment. I shall try briefly to work my way through each of the 14 government amendments. Some are of some substance; others are not. I shall try to cut the cloth accordingly.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_725"></a>Amendments Nos. 239, 240 and 241 are minor amendments to Clause 209, which is concerned with the service of documents by local authorities on persons for the purposes of Parts 1 to 4 and Part 7. They either deal with inconsistency between subsections or they clarify subsections. I do not need to say any more.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_726"></a>Government Amendment No. 244A provides that the appropriate national authority can make rules concerning the calculation of numbers of persons for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1464"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1464</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provisions of the Bill. It is intended that the rules will be made by calculating the number of persons, including, in   particular, children, for the purposes of licensing houses in multiple occupation. The appropriate national authority will consult on the rules and, of course, any order or regulation containing them will be laid before the House. Essentially, the rules will apply to the maximum permitted occupancy levels under licensing and shared amenity standards.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_727"></a> Government Amendment No. 252 provides that the new clause contained within Amendment No. 244A will come into force on the day that the Bill receives Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_728"></a>Government Amendment No. 253&#151;I have gone out of order but it does not matter&#151;is needed to update the Bill to provide for the commencement of new provisions inserted into the Bill during the Committee stage.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_729"></a>I turn to government Amendment No. 245. Schedule 12 makes minor and consequential amendments which are needed as a result of the Bill. This amendment simply adds to the schedule amendments which replace references in the Land Compensation Act 1973 to current housing enforcement notices&#151;repair notices and closing orders&#151;with the new enforcement notices in the Bill. The amendment is necessary to deal with both existing references to the 1973 Act and those in the new &quot;loss payment: exclusion&quot; provisions inserted by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_730"></a> Government Amendment No. 247 also relates to Schedule 12, which, again, makes minor and consequential amendments needed as a result of the Bill. The amendment revises the new Section 268 of the Housing Act 1985 that already appears in Schedule 12.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_731"></a>Amendments Nos. 248, 249 and 250 are to Schedule 13 and repeal a number of provisions made redundant by changes made as we have gone through the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_732"></a>I now return to my speaking note on government Amendment No. 242D. This is intended to close a major loophole in the legislation whereby a manager of a building can claim that the property is not a house in multiple occupation because the occupiers do not meet the necessary residency requirements. Essentially, the new clause introduced by the amendment places the   burden of proof with regard to these matters on the manager. The general rule of thumb is that, in order for a building to be regarded as house in multiple occupation, it must be occupied by persons as their only or main residence.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_733"></a> The Government recognise that there may be circumstances in which there is a mix of occupancies&#151;the most obvious example being bed and breakfast establishments, where some of the accommodation could be occupied by tourists and other accommodation could be occupied on a long-term basis by homeless families or asylum seekers. So we do not want a loophole to exist.
</p>

<a name="40916-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_734"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 252 and 253 are needed to update the Bill to provide for the commencement of new provisions inserted into the Bill during this Committee stage. If noble Lords wish to speak to Amendment No. 242A I shall be happy to respond to that now. I see the answer is &quot;No&quot;. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40916-47_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   The Bill has for the most part generated consensus across the party divide and across the medical and scientific community, subject to points of detail. Two areas, however, have been criticised. One is the absence of any detailed provisions relating to coroners and the failure to synchronise publication of the new coroners&#039; rules with our debates in Parliament on the Bill. We will come to that.
</p>

<a name="40916-47_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The other is the failure to synchronise the Bill with a new Mental Capacity Bill. We find ourselves in what can only be a most unsatisfactory situation, in which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC466"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC466</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we are asked to debate Clause 6 without having the benefit of knowing how it will marry up with the provisions of the Mental Capacity Bill in its final form. I made a similar complaint when we debated the clinical trials regulations earlier this year. Both the regulations and the Bill pre-empt the Mental Capacity Bill. It is unfortunate that in two of its major subject areas, we should be considering the Bill in what amounts to a vacuum.
</p>

<a name="40916-47_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Clause 6 did not receive much debate in another place, as it was inserted only on Third Reading. We must be clear about one thing straight away. If informed consent is a principle that the Government believe runs like a golden thread throughout the Bill, Clause 6 is the pair of scissors which breaks that thread. The idea of deemed consent in the context of the Bill is one that we should entertain only with extreme caution and in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40916-47_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>In Clause 7, which we shall debate later, it must be the High Court which decides on deemed consent where the donor is untraceable or dead. I agree with the Government that the High Court is the right place for such matters to be decided. In Clause 6, on the other hand, it is the Secretary of State who will decide how through regulations when the cardinal principle of informed consent is to be set aside. He will do so before knowing what conclusions Parliament has reached on the matter in primary legislation. That is a fairly rum state of affairs. We do not know what the regulations are likely to contain but we are potentially talking about a third party, such as a doctor in a hospital, being given absolute legal authority to decide that his team should be taken from a mentally incapacitated adult for the purposes of research&#151;or, indeed, any purpose listed in Schedule 1, theoretically, even transplantation.
</p>

<a name="40916-47_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The Explanatory Notes tell us that deemed consent will be provided for where the activity in question would be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;in the adult&#039;s best interests&#151;for example, it could be in their best interests to donate tissue to a close relative for transplantation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-47_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>I find that passage quite extraordinary. To my mind, you have to argue in fairly roundabout fashion that it is in a patient&#039;s best interests to carry out invasive surgery which is not designed to treat a condition in that patient. Clinically speaking, that can never be true. It can only be true on quite a different level where the considerations were not clinical at all.

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Any judgment on whether it is justified to remove bone marrow or a kidney from a mentally incapacitated adult will depend on a whole host of issues, which no doctor, however competent he is professionally, can cover on his own. We should ask the Minister to spend a little time elaborating the Government&#039;s intentions regarding the content of the regulations.

<a name="40916-47_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>On deemed consent for transplantation, what considerations will govern the decision to remove tissue from a patient, and who exactly will have the power to decide?

in question has been approved by a research ethics committee. Secondly, that the tissue for such research should be limited to surplus tissue removed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Thirdly, that the type of research to be permitted in these circumstances should be restricted to research specifically related to incapacity, which could be demonstrated to be of benefit, or potential benefit, to the patient or to others with the same incapacity. Can the Minister give me those assurances?

<a name="40916-47_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We are treading on very delicate ground in this clause&#151;considerably more delicate than the ground we tread in the rest of the Bill. I hope that the Minister can provide some measure of reassurance on it, although I fear that with the Mental Capacity Bill not yet debated, let alone enacted, she is not likely to be able to go more than a certain distance in putting my mind at rest.

<a name="40916-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has put the point very well. Of course debating the impact of Clause 6 is a way of raising the issue of linkage with the Mental Capacity Bill and the content of the regulations. I made some of the same points in the debate at the end of yesterday. I know the noble Baroness tried to give some clarification then. I had hoped that she would be able to further elucidate today.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>It seems unsatisfactory in some ways that one will have to read back from the Human Tissue Bill into the Mental Capacity Bill as well as having a set of regulations. Whether that will be satisfactory for ordinary researchers and so on in making this Bill work, I do not know. I suspect that it will be very unsatisfactory to have to refer to two Acts and a set of regulations when trying to carry out research of this kind. I can well understand the concerns of those, such as the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society, which has briefed Peers on this, that this will be a disincentive for the relevant research. Certainly, the more reassurance and transparency that the noble Baroness can provide about the expected process, the better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40916-48_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   I concur that there are real problems with the way that this Bill maps on to the Mental Capacity Bill. I draw the attention of the Committee to the wording of Clause 32 of the Mental Capacity Bill. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;If the court is satisfied that the research has the potential to benefit P without imposing on P a burden that is disproportionate to the potential benefit to P, it may make such declaration or order as it considers appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Yet, in this clause, we are talking about the Secretary of State. So we have two completely different mechanisms for dealing with issues around capacity.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The other difficulty is that although Clause 6 refers to a person who,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;lacks capacity to consent to the activity&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>and of course capacity is proportionate to the size of the decision to be taken, there are difficulties about fluctuating capacity and assessing capacity. There really are not very good tests to assess capacity subtly. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC468"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC468</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It is much easier when it is &quot;barn door&quot;, such as when someone is unconscious. But in the greyer areas that one particularly sees with people who have got degenerative brain diseases, such as Alzheimer&#039;s patients, they can appear very lucid in some areas and completely confused in others.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40916-48_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I shall try to take the issues raised by Members of the Committee in order and will then reiterate what we see as the important purpose of the clause. The noble Lord is right. Whenever legislation has to be consistent with another piece of legislation that is at a different stage, for very good reasons, problems will nearly always arise. That is why we must make extra efforts to ensure consistency.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Mental Capacity Bill has had a long and very thorough scrutiny, but it is not yet at the stage of this Bill. As I explained yesterday, one reason for bringing forward regulations in this clause in this way is to make it absolutely certain that not only would we match and accommodate the discussions and decisions that would be made subsequently under the Mental Capacity Bill but that we would also ensure consistency in all proper respects.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Members of the Committee have raised important points that we take on board. Many of the discussions that we had yesterday&#151;certainly the point raised by the noble Baroness today&#151;on the assessment and actual nature of incapacity are matters for that Bill. A great deal of time has been spent on defining, for example, best interests, and arriving at a set of definitions, which, as I understand it, are what the pre-legislative scrutiny intended to achieve.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>We can look forward with some confidence to the way that that Bill and discussions on it will accommodate some of the important issues that have been raised. That is not to say that it is not relevant to raise them here. Again, I reiterate that the reason why we have allowed ourselves the flexibility of a regulation-making power is to achieve just that.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The second point raised by the noble Lord concerned the importance of the exemption that we create in Clause 6; that is, the particular nature of the issue involving adults who lack capacity to consent. The whole point is that the Bill does not alter the common law position. No one can consent on behalf of a person who lacks capacity. But because the lack of capacity is difficult to establish in relation to mental incapacity, we are particularly bound to take grave care that such people are not treated differently and are not put in a disadvantageous position. That is why yesterday when I spoke on the amendment, I took particular time to explain that we thought that adding a qualification to that particular element was discriminatory in terms of the lengths to which all researchers should go to obtain consent in all circumstances. In substance that is very important indeed, and is why we were unhappy with the amendment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40916-48_time0"></a><h5>2.15 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The noble Lord made several points regarding best interests and the nature of regulation. I spelt out at length the cases that we envisage might arise under the issue of best interests. The noble Lord was quite right to say that, in a sense, this refers to a set of circumstances that are not necessarily or even predictably relevant to the medical needs of the person who is to give consent. It is governed by a set of relationships. We would argue that consent may well be in the best interests of a person lacking mental capacity if a carer or relative on whom they are dependent is in need of a transplant or other procedure requiring the use of their tissue, and without which the carer may be in danger of dying and, therefore, not in a position to take care of the person. That is not a far-fetched instance and we were able to cite one example where there had already been a court case. Such a situation could well arise in the future, although under different circumstances, and we intend to provide for that.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I turn to the wider questions that were raised. The regulations could also allow research using the tissue of incapacitated persons where participation in the research by a person who lacks capacity is authorised in accordance with the clinical trials regulations which came into force in May. Such use of tissue would be subject to the safeguards set out in those regulations, which include that the research must be approved by an ethics committee. I hope that that goes some way to answering the questions put to me by the noble Earl.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The regulations will also be able to take account of the outcome of debates on the Mental Capacity Bill later this Session, and that is where research and the conditions attached to research will be debated in that context. Obviously we do not want to pre-empt the debates that will accompany the passage of the Mental Capacity Bill, which itself may in due course replace by amendment the regulation-making powers we have taken here.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the factors to be taken into account when assessing whether the removal of tissue is in the patient&#039;s best interests, a question raised by the noble Earl. Again, I must reiterate a point that has been made several times during our discussions on the Bill. This legislation does not address the question of the removal of tissue from living adults, which is currently dealt with under a common law test of best interests and, in the future, will be dealt with by the Mental Capacity Bill. If tissue has been removed in a patient&#039;s best interests, Clause 6 regulations to provide for the storage and use of such tissue will come into effect. If tissue has been removed for another purpose, such as for diagnosis, the regulations will allow it to be used in the patient&#039;s best interests. In time that will draw on the commitment made under common law as well as on the Mental Capacity Bill, so we shall have a follow-through from that legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The final point made was that I should refer to amendments to the provisions dealing with DNA so that regulations will be able to provide for when it will be lawful to have material from an adult who lacks <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC470"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC470</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

capacity for the purpose of analysing DNA. These also apply to Scotland, where it will be necessary to take account in the regulations of the authority conferred by the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 over tissue taken whether for research or for any of the other purposes I have already outlined.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I return to the other question raised by the noble Earl about the kind of research which might be anticipated in relation to incapacity. He asked whether the research should be limited to conditions which particularly affect incapacitated patients. I am not speaking from a brief at this point, but I should have thought it would be unwise to lay down any limitations regarding the kind of research which might be carried out, although I see the case that has been made both by the noble Earl and by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. However, I will read carefully what the noble Lord has said and take it on board.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>We recognise that allowing the use of tissue of incapacitated people is a very sensitive issue. The House has a very good record of being extremely sensitive and careful of the rights of people with mental incapacity. We have provided that the regulations&#151;which obviously will be widely consulted on, and I am sure these issues will be raised in different contexts by different groups&#151;will be introduced under the affirmative resolution procedure and there will be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss details which may not have been debated elsewhere. We will have the opportunity during the passage of the Mental Capacity Bill for much more detailed analysis and discussion of the issues and areas which fall much more relevantly within the context of that Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>With those assurances in this very complex area, I hope that the Committee will not challenge Clause 6 standing part of the Bill. We believe it is an extremely important element of what we are trying to do.

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40916-49_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for her reply. She is attempting to be as helpful as possible in the circumstances, but my bafflement grew the more I listened to what she had to say. She used the word &quot;complex&quot; herself. In addition to two primary pieces of legislation, we now hear that the EU clinical trials directive as transposed into regulation will also have a bearing on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>That only confirms to me that the fears of those who believe that research in this area will be impeded unnecessarily&#151;obviously one needs to ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place&#151;are entirely justified. One will need to be a barrack room lawyer before starting a process of research of this kind. Can the noble Baroness give any assurance about the way in which this will be presented eventually as a communication so that those engaged in research will at least have some clear guidance on which they can rely? Will it be through the GMC? If people are not medically qualified, obviously it will be provided by someone else. The more the noble Baroness referred to the different aspects of this issue, the worse it got.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I felt that there was a concrete block in the Minister&#039;s thinking in regard to the idea that to have any additional qualification in Clause 6 was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC471"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC471</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discrimination. The circumstances are rather different. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, and I talked about this yesterday on an amendment, so I shall not go on about it, but there is a big difference between discrimination and differentiation. It seems to me that, in certain circumstances where you cannot ask someone about his history and whether or not he has consented, it is perfectly valid to have a different standard for the researcher in inquiring whether consent has been withdrawn or given for the reasons that we argued yesterday. We need to examine the idea that it is discrimination rather than differentiation because the circumstances are different.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I hope that a little flexibility will be considered. We heard the Minister&#039;s response yesterday but, on reflection, as she was speaking today it seemed to me that if you label something &quot;discrimination&quot; you will come to the conclusion that that is absolutely not the right thing to do to qualify; but differentiation is a rather different concept.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40916-49_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   Perhaps I have understood the Minister slightly differently. I took some comfort from her words that she does not wish to be too prescriptive and too narrow because of the variable nature of the research that needs to be carried out, particularly on patients in intensive care and so on.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I was trying to glean some comfort, imagining that it might be possible to say that, because a person was the kind of person who would want to contribute to medical research, it would be deemed to be in that person&#039;s best interests even though he was not going to benefit from the results. For instance, a person may be on a ventilator, already have been declared brain dead and the ventilator about to be switched off, but obtaining specimens just prior to that phase may contribute hugely to the general knowledge.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>So my interpretation is slightly different. I hope that the Minister is leaving matters open for broader interpretation rather than narrowing them. My concern always has been that if we are over-prescriptive we will make it impossible to carry out research which will genuinely benefit future generations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40916-49_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My concerns were raised when I read the Explanatory Notes, because they refer specifically to transplantation rather than to research. I also took some comfort from what the Minister said and am grateful to her for taking the trouble she did to answer me. If I understood the noble Baroness correctly, she said that strictly speaking this clause is not about the removal of tissue from an incapacitated adult. Indeed, if we look back at Clause 1(1), to which it relates, that refers to storage for use, not for removal of tissue.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Nevertheless, when the idea of transplantation is introduced, that presupposes that someone has removed an organ with the consent of someone else. You would not remove any tissue or organ from a patient unless you had an end in view if it was a transplant of an organ. So, somewhere along the line <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC472"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

you have to get closer to who decides on the circumstances in which it is justified to remove tissue for transplantation.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>This relates back also to a debate we had yesterday on an amendment I tabled which was designed to flag up the possibility that someone in whose gift it is to take the decision about what happened to the organ of a dead or dying patient might be in line directly to benefit from that decision. The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said that that did not trouble him or the officials. They could not see what mischief there was.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The potential mischief, I would have thought, is that if the patient is someone with strong religious beliefs, like Mrs Isaacs, or Mr Isaacs, it might be possible for the personal representative or member of the family conveniently to overlook that fact if they stood to benefit from a decision of that kind. In framing the rules as to who is able to decide these matters, we need to bear the whole context in mind. Whether it is research or transplantation, there is a broader context than just the medical one.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>In the clinical trials regulations, if I remember rightly, there was a stipulation that a clinical trial on a mentally incapacitated person should be undertaken only if there was no one of mental capacity available to do that same trial and that there was, therefore, a specific point to using a mentally incapacitated person for that work. I did not hear the Minister bring that kind of qualification into this context. That is also something that we need to consider. She said that maybe there should be flexibility on what kind of research should be allowed using tissue from a mentally incapacitated person. I shall have to reflect on that point between now and Report.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I reiterate, however, my appreciation to the Minister for what she said. I shall read her words very carefully, and we should move on.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 7 sets out the power of the High Court to dispense with the need for consent. Clearly, the introduction of a mechanism to make exceptions to the requirement for consent to use tissue for research is essential to ensure that important research can proceed&#151;subject to safeguards&#151;where consent cannot be obtained if this is clearly in the public interest.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC473"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>However, it is questionable whether the High Court is the most appropriate mechanism for this. The burden of going to the High Court seems excessive and unsuitable for this type of application. I am not sure that the High Court is necessarily the best place to deal with questions of this kind of application. I think that it is likely ultimately to deter researchers undertaking research of a fundamental nature.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Amendments Nos. 29 and 32 would empower the Secretary of State to establish an advisory group and to issue regulations concerning the dispensing by him, on the advice of the advisory group, of the need for consent for the use of tissue for research in certain cases.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>In many cases the Government have mechanisms which are exercised by the Secretary of State, on the advice of an advisory body. I must confess that it is not entirely clear to me why the High Court has been adopted as the mechanism in this case. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40916-49_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Before I address the amendment, I reiterate the purpose of the clause. Clause 7 covers two circumstances. First, it provides for what we might call a &quot;private interest&quot;. It allows for a court to deem there to be consent where there is tissue in store from a person known to be alive and competent, but where the individual concerned is untraceable and there is no known consent or refusal. This tissue could be used to inform the treatment, care or diagnosis of relatives.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The second exceptional instance deals with the possibility that, in the broader public health interest, tissue from a deceased person might be needed for important research but we cannot find the next of kin.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Amendment No. 29 has the effect of allowing the Secretary of State to make regulations waiving the need for consent to storage and use of tissue for research, instead of the High Court considering such matters, as the Bill provides. Amendment No. 32 sets up a tissue advisory group.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The noble Lord asked where we got this provision from and why we think it important to use the High Court and not another mechanism. In brief, the provision was introduced in response to concerns of the research community in another place, that there should be some exceptional opportunity to follow through in these types of cases. There was a long discussion and the issue of the High Court was raised. The common agreement and understanding is that it reflects the seriousness of the situation and the exceptional nature under which these powers will be used.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The kind of unusual and expected circumstances which might justify a court to order a waiver of consent is, for example, where it is necessary to analyse tissues in relation to a genetic condition in a relative, but where the original donor of the stored tissue is no longer contactable. Relatives lose touch with each other. There is clearly a problem in some cases. Treatment of a relative could be unnecessarily delayed or compromised.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The other example of the public interest is when we might need access to tissue for research belonging to a person who arrived in this country and who died of an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC474"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC474</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unknown virus. Perhaps the relatives&#039; consent cannot be obtained because he has no relatives or they cannot be traced. It might be necessary in those circumstances to research the disease that he died of in order to safeguard the public.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The regime proposed by the amendment is that a waiver of the need for consent would be a fairly common-place matter and that there would be a real role for a special advisory group. We do not agree with that assumption. In any case, the involvement of the Secretary of State, let alone an advisory committee, suggests another degree of bureaucracy and delay. Rather than being an expediting procedure, it could throw yet more obstacles in the way.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>It is one of the fundamental tenets of the Bill that consent is needed for the use of tissue in research. The removal, retention and use of tissue from the deceased is a matter of the greatest sensitivity. Although we are providing through an amendment in another place for this court order in exceptional cases&#151;which we did at the suggestion of the professionals involved&#151;it really should be seen as exceptional. However, that is not to say that the process must be onerous. Court orders can be swiftly given by judges in chambers, and it will be for regulations, after consultation, to set out how that can best be done. It will also be subject to parliamentary approval.
</p>

<a name="40916-49_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I am therefore optimistic that this is an appropriate and proportional way of dealing with the matter in view of its seriousness and the need for speed. I would add that the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which has responsibility for the court system, is content with this arrangement. That may or may not persuade the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

Like the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I am a little concerned over the thought that such issues might have to go to the High Court. While, on the one hand, the noble Baroness said that to have an advisory group advising the Secretary of State on regulations in this field would create another layer of bureaucracy, my personal experience would suggest that having to refer all these issues to the High Court would be equally complex and time consuming. For that reason I am attracted by the idea that regulations could be so framed as to make this exceptional circumstance possible without reference to the High Court, on the advice of an advisory group of experts who have been able to persuade the Secretary of State of the significance and importance of these regulations.

use of the High Court. One is going to have to hear evidence. You will have to have experts. It is going to be fairly protracted. It is going to be a rather expensive process as well. The cost of an expert for a day in the High Court is not inconsiderable. Even if they read written evidence&#151;in fact, particularly if they read written evidence&#151;it will be expensive.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>It is very interesting to see Ministers turn arguments on opposition proponents and say, &quot;That would be bureaucratic&quot;&#151;which is often the argument made by opposition spokesman against government proposals. However, speaking as a lawyer, I can assure the Committee that in those circumstances it is far more bureaucratic to go to court than it is to rely on the advice of an advisory body which at least tries to predict the sorts of circumstances that might be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The Minister&#039;s killer argument was that the Department for Constitutional Affairs is content. It would be; there is more work for the judges. I am sure that we are all very keen to ensure that our legal expertise is utilised to the full. Strangely enough, I thought that the examples that the Minister gave were very interesting and spot on. They were precisely the kinds of examples that an advisory body would come up with.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I am not going to shift the Minister in her thinking. The debate has, however, rather opened the box. I concede that a very valuable concession was made in another place. However, I do not think that the department should simply assume that, now that the matter is in the House of Lords, it can cease all further thought on whether the Bill can be developed further. Other mechanisms might be appropriate. I hope that the department is still in creative mode and that we can make further progress on improving the Bill. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Earl said: Clause 7 of the Bill deals with giving powers to the court to dispense with the need for consent. The Explanatory Notes make clear, as did the noble Baroness, that the power granted to the Secretary of State in subsection (3) to make regulations permitting a court to deem consent to be in place where someone had died would be exercised only in rare and unusual cases. The Explanatory Notes state that the research would have to be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;in the overwhelming public interest, for example, where a person has died of an unknown virus which has the potential to spread among the general population&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I am fully in sympathy with the intent behind the provision but, if we read subsection (3), the flavour intended, of it being used only in rare and unusual cases, completely fails to come through. If that genuinely is the intention, I put it to the Minister that some kind of appropriate qualifying phrase should be inserted. I do not claim that my amendment is necessarily the right phrase&#151;it probably is not legalese <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC476"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and various alternatives perhaps could be devised&#151;but we surely cannot have any suggestion that a court can make an order of the kind envisaged without first establishing that there are overwhelming public interest reasons for doing so. I think that the face of the Bill as well as the regulations should make that clear. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40916-50_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   There may be a simple difference of opinion between us. Obviously we are sympathetic to the reasoning behind the argument. It is perfectly obvious that you would not invoke this, nor describe it as an exceptional use of powers, if it was not in the public interest to do so. We believe that the clause rests on that presumption.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I shall not repeat what I said on the previous amendment, but we have listened hard and we see this in terms of &quot;unexpected and exceptional circumstances&quot;. Clearly these would include cases where there is a definite public interest which is so overwhelming as to justify a departure from the Bill&#039;s consent requirements. I have explained the nature of some of those.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The noble Earl has made a case and we are aware of it now. I ask him to withdraw the amendment&#151;basically because we cannot agree.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I also wish to say a word about the regulations. We do not see the regulations as providing a loophole or as a means of circumventing the consent requirement which would otherwise have been in place. This might be a question that other noble Lords have in mind. Although we cannot by definition envisage all the circumstances where it might be appropriate, there is no doubt that unexpected circumstances will arise. We have taken a general power to allow time for further consideration and consultation on the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the court to have the power to dispense with consent.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The regulations will make clear the limited circumstances in which courts may be asked to waive consent and the nature of the public interest. They will be subject to affirmative resolution. So the debate is not ended; it is very much ongoing.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I have heard what the noble Earl said. At the moment we are content that the clause will do what it is supposed to do. On that basis, I hope the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Having recently criticised the clause suggesting that reference to the High Court would be necessary under this part of the Bill, it may be paradoxical to say that her purpose in tabling the amendment was to give wider powers to the High Court and to strengthen the powers of the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Perhaps the noble Baroness may be able to reassure me that the wording that she has tabled in the amendment is taken directly from Clause 32(8) of the draft Mental Capacity Bill. It has the intention of making it clear that in these exceptional circumstances the High Court, through the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State, could dispense with the need for anonymisation where no voluntary consent could possibly be obtained. We would certainly wish to be clear whether the powers under the clause as presently drafted would be sufficient to meet all the pros and cons of difficult situations which may arise in a research setting. I could give examples but I shall not detain the Committee by doing so.

<a name="40916-50_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The noble Lord has drawn attention to the fact that the amendment proposes the setting up of a very wide power for a court to use to undermine the fundamental elements of the Bill. Notwithstanding the reasons given or the nature of the questions raised in relation to the Mental Capacity Bill&#151;or, indeed, the nature of the research anticipated&#151;we have to be quite clear that the amendment goes far beyond what we would want the court to be able to do. It undermines the fundamental elements of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>As I explained on previous amendments, the clause allows for the deeming of consent in exceptional circumstances in the public interest&#151;for example, where research may be needed to protect the public&#151;where no person is able or available to give consent. By definition, we cannot predict all the circumstances which may arise under that heading. I cannot easily add to that.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>We believe that the provision, together with the other powers in Clauses 6 and 7, makes sensible and proportional provision for extraordinary circumstances. At the risk of sounding like Vice President Cheney, we have tried to provide for the known and unknown in terms of individuals, but the amendment goes further into what might be called the unimaginable&#151;and the law could be in serious trouble if we tried to define that.
</p>

<a name="40916-50_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling a court to make any order whatever, including the one relating to the use in research of post-mortem material already set in Clause 7.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>After Clause 7, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
   &quot;POWERS OF COURT TO OVERRIDE REFUSAL TO CONSENT

<br>
   If the High Court is satisfied&#151;


<br>
(a)   that relevant material has come from the body of a living person,


<br>
(b)   that notwithstanding the refusal of that person to consent to the material being used for the purpose of obtaining scientific or medical information about him, it is desirable in the interests of another person (including a future person) to prevent mortality or significant morbidity that the material should be so used,


<br>
   it may order that this subsection apply to the material for the benefit of the other person.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_33"></a>The noble Earl said: It is very welcome that Clause 7 contains a provision for the High Court to dispense with the need for consent where an existing sample needs to be tested in order to help diagnose or treat another person in circumstances where the donor cannot be traced. As we have discussed, such situations are likely to be rare, but when they do occur, they could be important.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The related issue that the Bill does not address is the situation where someone has refused permission for his or her tissue to be used for any purpose other than their own diagnosis or treatment, or perhaps not even that, but where it is overwhelmingly in the public interest or in the interests of another individual for those wishes to be overridden. One can hypothesise on various scenarios where this situation might conceivably arise. All of them would involve very narrow sets of circumstances where other people are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC479"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC479</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exposed to a risk of death or serious harm by the denial of permission to carry out tests, but in those rare cases it should be possible for doctors to seek a decision of the High Court as to whose interests should be paramount and whether the tissue owner&#039;s refusal to consent should stand or be overruled.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Exactly the same issue could arise in connection with the provisions of Clause 50 and Schedule 5 with regard to information derived from DNA. Here again my amendment No. 102 posits that there could be rare situations where nondisclosure of data could result in death or serious harm for a relative of a person whose DNA is at issue, or, indeed, not necessarily for a relative, but it is perhaps most likely to be.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>It is primarily geneticists whose activities are affected here where competing interests of relatives have to be finely balanced and where issues of reproductive choice have to be addressed. For us to have, as we do in the Bill, an absolute bar on allowing tissue to be used or analysed against the wishes of the donor no matter what the circumstances is, I suggest, needlessly and unacceptably stringent. There should be a means whereby, as a last resort, in a court of law the potential benefactor is able to argue his or her own case.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>There are parallels for this idea in existing law where there are conflicts between individuals about confidential information, for example, and about rights of life and private life under the Human Rights Act and all sorts of other types of case. The High Court has ultimate jurisdiction to decide whose interests should prevail.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I hope very much that the Minister will be sympathetic to this proposal. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40916-51_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   Having put my name to this amendment I rise briefly to support what was said by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It seems to me that this is precisely the backstop which can be provided by the High Court, because it will be on very rare occasions that recourse would be had to the High Court in these circumstances. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, the High Court frequently has this kind of backstop power to make decisions in conflicts between individuals about confidential information and right of life but also in family law issues. The High Court sometimes has to cut the Gordian knot as regards the position on assets, property and so forth. The amendment makes eminent sense. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on this as an absolute backstop.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40916-51_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   I wholly agree with the points that have been made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I can think of a series of very rare but important circumstances where a provision of this nature is crucial.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Let us consider a woman whose family has had a variety of different cancers, including colorectal, endometrial and gastric. She thinks that she may have inherited a predisposing gene, particularly if her <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC480"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC480</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mother and father both died in their forties from breast and gastric cancer. If she has only a single living relative who had surgery for endometrial cancer in her late thirties but who now refuses to allow the lady&#039;s doctors to extract a sample of DNA from the tissue removed from that relative to test it for mutations, then the lady in question will have no knowledge of her level of risk.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out, there have been circumstances in which the High Court has overridden the refusal of consent from individuals relating to such issues as caesarean section and even, in one notable case, the amputation of a limb. I myself worked in the field of neuro-muscular disease. A similar issue can arise in the case of a female whose brother suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A biopsy taken from him 20 years ago, if studied using molecular biology techniques, would now indicate whether the disease arose from a mutation or as a result of his parent being a carrier. In that case, it is crucial for the woman to find out whether she is a carrier and therefore at risk of passing the disease on to her sons. If her brother refuses to allow his biopsy to be re-examined using modern techniques, she will not have the opportunity to be made aware of the risk that she is a carrier.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>In such rare and exceptional circumstances, this provision could be used as a backstop. It is vital and ought to be included in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40916-51_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken and for their examples. We understand the source of concern for this provision. It would introduce a new power for the High Court to override the refusal of someone to allow their tissue to be used to obtain information that may be relevant to another person&#151;the purpose listed in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1. The amendment to Schedule 5, the DNA offence schedule, would allow a court to override the refusal of someone to allow analysis of their DNA in order to obtain information relevant to someone else.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Without wanting to use language that is too emotive, I should say that the amendment, though sincerely meant, would drive a stake through the heart of the Bill because it goes against its basic principle; namely, that people should be able to decide what happens to their bodily material.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>We have already talked about Clause 7 in relation to the waiver available to the High Court in exceptional circumstances. That applies only when reasonable efforts to trace the original person have failed and there is no reason to believe that he or she has refused consent. But allowing a court to override an explicit refusal would be to go against the principle of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The arguments of noble Lords refer to cases where relatives have refused to allow the use of their tissue. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Walton, just cited a graphic example. There may well be such cases, but we feel that we cannot allow a power to override the principle of the Bill on the basis of that assumption. Moreover, I would stress, particularly in relation to geneticists who frequently use relatives&#039; material for the purpose of cross-referencing diagnoses and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC481"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC481</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

treatment, that the Bill&#039;s provisions do not apply to existing holdings. Therefore as I understand the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, there would be no problem about using that material. Anything being held at the time when the Bill comes into force, reflecting past practice, will remain available for use. The issue concerns only future, newly collected material where, having been asked, individuals decline to allow it to be used for the purpose of informing the care of another.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>This is where we come to the second major aspect of the debate. We are talking about relatives; that is people who are close and love each other who want, in the huge majority of instances, to help each other in future. One of the major objectives of this legislation and establishing a framework is to create a better environment for discussing with patients and their relatives what happens to their tissue and how it can be used to benefit members of the family.
<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="40916-51_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>My sense&#151;and, I would have thought, the experience in the Committee&#151;is that, in the vast majority of cases, relatives are only too anxious&#151;indeed, would go out of their way beyond mere altruism&#151;to help with the care of other members of their family. Moreover, we have every expectation that we can build on current good practice to ensure that people willingly and genuinely contribute to scientific medical research and progress through a positive engagement. That is the only way in which we can progress. Given the failings of the past in some areas; given the difficulties and confusions that researchers and clinicians face and given what this Bill is trying to do, we must establish systems whereby if we know the potential value of people&#039;s tissue, particularly in genetics, when their tissue is taken they should be asked whether they are content for it to be used for purposes such as research or to inform their family&#039;s care.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>It will not be onerous. It is common practice. With the best will in the world, I cannot believe that geneticists will have difficulty with that. We know that 99 per cent of people will agree, but this is a reason to discuss it with them to enable them to agree rather than not to ask. Although I understand the seriousness and purpose of the arguments, the justification for overriding someone&#039;s decision to refuse consent for the use of their tissue in this draconian way needs to be very compelling.
</p>

<a name="40916-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>After all, if a competent person refuses to allow tissue to be removed, there is nothing in law that allows us to insist on that. We cannot remove tissue without the person&#039;s agreement: the Bill simply provides that it cannot be used without their agreement. That is a position that we have to respect. It might be desirable to speed up the diagnosis of susceptibility to disease, but we have not seen evidence that it is essential as a matter of urgency or emergency to use one person&#039;s material in order to save the life or health of another.

<a name="40916-51_para20"></a>

I was very impressed by the examples given by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, who speaks on these matters with huge experience and authority. I also recognise the case made by the Minister in defence of her legislation. She did not use the phrase &quot;drive a coach and horses&quot; through the principles of the Bill, but that is, I think, what she was trying to say.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I base myself in my own experience; if a government department or a Minister takes a position, then resists anything that could impinge on that position or could be thought to be whittling away the purpose and therefore thinks that they have to stand fast, that is a very dangerous position to get into.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I listened with great care to what the Minister said. But, in my view&#151;I speak entirely as a layman&#151;the argument made by my noble friend Lord Howe and the examples given by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, carried the day. The noble Baroness used the phrase, &quot;a major departure&quot;. Both my noble friend and the noble Lord said that those would be very exceptional cases. But I find it very difficult to believe that it is right that one should allow one member of a family simply to say, &quot;No, I am not going to do anything to help other members of the family. I withhold my consent&quot;, however unreasonable that should be. It seems to me that there should be some mechanism whereby that can be overridden. That is what is being asked for here and, if it came to a vote, although we do not vote in Grand Committee, I would have no hesitation in supporting the amendment because, with the greatest respect to the noble Baroness, I think she has got it wrong.

<a name="40916-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>There needs to be room for a bit of flexibility in order to avoid in individual cases what could be very severe injustice and hardship. We should not be building that into a Bill of this kind; we should be able to make provision for the kind of cases that have been illustrated.

<a name="40916-52_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I just reiterate my point, which is very important: existing holdings, archive materials of tissue that is held, are not affected by the provision. In many of the cases cited by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, the material will be able to be used just as at present because the Bill does not touch it. It applies only in future, when the whole point of the Bill is to obtain consent, to make it impossible for the sloppy practices of the past to continue. That is something that the profession as a whole, every researcher in conscience, would want.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Obtaining consent is not onerous; it is important. It drives a stake through the heart of the Bill if we allow flexibility. I take the noble Lord&#039;s point, but we resist, not perversely or stubbornly, but because we genuinely <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40916-52_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   What the noble Baroness says about existing holdings of tissue is absolutely right, but she will surely agree that once the Bill is enacted, tissue subsequently removed for diagnostic purposes cannot then be used to benefit another family member. We are thinking not just of the past and present but of the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40916-52_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I am very disappointed by the noble Baroness&#039;s reply and, correspondingly, all the more grateful to my noble friend Lord Jenkin and the noble Lords, Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Walton. The point that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, just made&#151;that archive material will be progressively less relevant as time goes on&#151;is extremely pertinent. Of course, one can come up with all sorts of examples of cases not involving existing holdings. Where, for instance, families are estranged, for reasons that many of us might regard as illogical, someone may refuse consent to enable a family member to benefit. Not all families are close and loving, alas. I wish they were. To allow no opportunity whatever for a potential beneficiary even to argue his case in front of the judge is a retrograde step.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Clause 9 [<i>Existing holdings</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40916-52_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>   moved Amendment No. 34:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>Page 8, line 38, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Subsection (1) does not apply if a person storing an existing holding for use for a purpose specified in Schedule 1, or using an existing holding for a purpose so specified, is made aware of a decision not to consent to such storage or use by&#151;

<br>
(a)   the nominated representative of the deceased person, or


<br>
(b)   a person who stood in a qualifying relationship to the deceased person immediately before he died.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_42"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment is similar in its purpose to my earlier amendment to Clause 1. As the Committee will remember, I suggested that the right of a living person to object to his tissue being used for a given purpose should be enshrined in the Bill in order to avoid doubt and legal argument. The same consideration applies in Clause 9 in relation to tissue from existing tissue banks.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I very much welcome the pragmatic approach taken by the Government to the matter. It is surely right to say, as the Bill does, that tissue banks should be exempt from the consent rules laid down in the Bill. However, at the same time, we need to ask ourselves what happens if someone discovers that tissue that came from a husband, wife or relation is held in an existing tissue bank and he or she violently objects. What happens if there is a repeat of the terrible story of Mrs Isaacs where, let us say, a widow discovers that the brain of her husband is being held in a tissue bank <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC484"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for research purposes without anyone&#039;s consent and that runs absolutely contrary to the religious beliefs of the dead person?
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I believe that it would be in accordance with the spirit of the Bill to say that in such circumstances, uncommon as they may be, the wishes of the surviving widow or a relation should override the legal immunity conferred by this clause. If we are serious about that, we need to ensure that there is no scope for legal argument by placing a suitable provision on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40916-52_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   As we said in the previous amendment, Clause 9 relates to all existing holdings other than anatomical specimens and simply provides that it will be lawful to use and to store for use for a scheduled purpose any existing holdings, which include archives held for research purposes, without the need for consent under Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>This is a very important principle which has been intended precisely to ensure that it will be lawful for clinicians and scientists to keep indefinitely and to use in research that tissue which is archived when the Bill takes effect. We are talking of banks of tissue, but also other archives and other stores of tissue, which have enormous potential value. Indeed, many have been collected for many years under the conditions, including the legal conditions, prevailing at the time. So, it is a provision of fundamental importance to the research community.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I understand that the amendment is tabled with the best of intentions. I have to point out, however, that it raises very grave, and I would argue practically insoluble, problems. It raises questions about whether there should be some retrospective power of veto over the use of such tissue and whether there should be retrospective reviews of whether in each case a next-of-kin might object. It would be wholly impractical and inappropriate in many cases to insist that this has to be disposed of or that all individuals had to be re-contacted in order to obtain their specific consent to the use of all this archived material for any of the scheduled purposes. With respect, it is simply not possible to do that. In many cases the individuals will have moved, may have died or may be, for other reasons, beyond contact. The amendment would necessitate such procedures.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The concerns expressed in the amendment reflect the history underlying the Bill. The noble Earl referred to the very sad case of Mr Isaacs and the fact that tissue was collected from post-mortems that might not have had the full or proper consent of the families concerned. We also recognise that the collection of the samples in the past would not have been ideal by today&#039;s standard but was not necessarily unlawful and, sad to say, was generally in keeping with prevailing practices. We have learned much, not least from major reports in recent years, of the process of organ retention, which has led us to introduce many measures to try to address those poor practices. Not least, we have established much better information and consent systems so that much of today&#039;s practice <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC485"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC485</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will be set out in the interim statement. It means that today&#039;s practice is better aligned with what we would expect under the Human Tissue Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Through the tireless efforts of the Retained Organs Commission and many dedicated individuals in trusts and strategic health authorities whose job it has been to improve the situation, many families have been assisted in recovering or making decisions about the tissue and organs retained from their deceased loved ones. We have developed and published guidance on the continued handling of these very delicate matters as well as on the future use of stored tissue. The Human Tissue Authority will have the specific responsibility of maintaining such guidance through codes of practice and advice both to professionals and the public.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>However, our main concern, and that of the noble Earl, is to address the situation for the future. Tissue currently held in storage will have come from many sources, in many different circumstances, and will be subject to varying degrees of consent, some of which will have been recorded, and some of which may not. It seems to us that the only sensible approach is to provide some measure of flexibility. That is not to say that we are providing a <i>carte blanche</i> for researchers to use any tissue in any and all circumstances; far from it.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The complexity of the issue is one that is not conducive to handling through primary legislation. In Clause 9, therefore, we are providing simply for it to be lawful to continue to hold and to use for a scheduled purpose any tissue that is currently in storage for that purpose. But we have also provided in Clause 26 for the Human Tissue Authority to issue a code of practice which will give guidance on the circumstances in which existing holdings might be used.
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="40916-52_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-52_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>We know that there is an urgent need for greater clarity and certainty. The position of existing holdings has already been problematic. Many pathology departments have found difficulty in understanding what their position is at the present time.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>That is precisely why we issued the interim statement on the use of human organs and tissue in April 2003. The statement gave guidance on the questions to be addressed when considering whether tissue might be used for research or other purposes. It set out our understanding of the law as it currently stands, and provided a supplementary note for research ethics committees so we could try to achieve some consistency in the use of currently retained tissue. That interim statement was prepared following widespread consultation with professional groups and with family groups, and we understand that it has been of some considerable use to researchers, and to ethics committees. That is why I say that the HTA, in preparing its code of practice for the future, will build on that interim statement.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The amendment would not only involve extremely complex processes for tracing tissues held for many years; it would certainly perpetuate uncertainty surrounding the use of archived tissue. We want to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC486"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

avoid that. We recognise the intention of the amendment and, as I said, we have sought to address those concerns in the way that we have provided advice and guidance to date, the benefits of which experience will be carried forward in the HTA. However, we think that it is time to draw a line under the past and move forward with a more pragmatic approach.
</p>

<a name="40916-52_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I am trying to be very sympathetic to the amendment. In the light of what I have said about the steps we have taken, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw it.

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40916-53_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   There is quite a lot I could say in reply to that. However, I think that I am going to have to be content with the noble Baroness&#039;s assurance that the codes of practice will deal with this matter adequately. As I mentioned earlier, the case that is uppermost in my mind is that of Mrs Isaacs. It would be absolutely intolerable if someone such as Mrs Isaacs discovered that the brain of her husband was being held in a tissue bank and that she had no legal right to say to that tissue bank that the brain should be returned to her for decent disposal. We can have all the codes of practice in the world, but without that legal right I suspect that someone might feel very vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>However, the issue is whether this is a matter for the face of the Bill. I shall have to go away and reflect on that. I will simply say this. The intention of the amendment was one that the noble Baroness rightly picked up, regardless of the actual phraseology of it, which no doubt has unwelcome consequences. But I am convinced that the intention is right in principle. It is now just a question of my deciding how to take the issue forward. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>Page 10, line 9, at beginning insert &quot;Subject to subsections (3) and (4),&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 36 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 38 and 39.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Clause 11 presents us with a prime example, if ever there was one, of the dog in the night-time who fails to bark. It contains what for many of us is the most unsatisfactory feature of the whole Bill; namely, the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of any activity done for purposes of functions of a coroner.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>When we call to mind the events which led to the creation of the Bill in the first instance, many of which stemmed from actions taken or not taken by coroners, it is at best ironic and at worst deeply regrettable that we cannot debate in any substantive way what we believe the duties of coroners or their codes of practice should look like.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC487"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC487</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The first observation I would make about the clause is that the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;purposes or functions of a coroner&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>is not defined. Indeed, we understand that, even as we speak, the definition is being thrashed out by Ministers and officials in the Home Office in preparation for the publication of the new coroners&#039; rules later this year. The fact that the publication of the rules and the passage of this Bill through Parliament has not been synchronised is, I believe, most unfortunate.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>But we have to face reality. Clearly the most we can do in debating the Bill is to lay down some markers. The first marker is surely to say that the demarcation line between a coroner&#039;s statutory core functions and those things which are not core functions but which, nevertheless, he may do under his own authority, needs to be much clearer than is currently the case. Equally, there are things which a coroner may do under his own authority which should quite properly override the general provisions of this Bill, and other things which he is able to do which ought not to override them. At what point should a coroner&#039;s authority cease and the wishes of a nominated representative or relative kick in?
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>That question rose to the fore in the case of Mr Cyril Isaacs, whose brain was passed by the North Manchester Coroner&#039;s Office to a research programme at Manchester University. That was done not only without consent, but also contrary to the express wishes of his family. The brain was removed and transferred to the researchers, having been identified by staff at the coroner&#039;s office as being of possible interest to a joint research programme run by the departments of psychiatry and physiology at the university. It is not unfair to say that this came about as a result of a cosy, informal relationship between those departments and the coroner&#039;s office.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>In fact, as the official report disclosed, over 21,000 brains, collected between 1970 and 1999 were found to be held at various centres, most of them from coroners&#039; cases and a great many without consent. It would appear that once the coroner&#039;s work on a body had been completed, it was generally thought best that the brains should be used for research rather than being disposed of as waste.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Unlike brains collected from hospital post-mortems, where consent procedures were usually followed scrupulously, the consent process in coroners&#039; cases was either fudged or ignored. There was a widespread ignorance of what the consent requirements were in such cases, as well as an assumption that the coroner had the authority to retain any organ, irrespective of whether it had a bearing on the cause of death.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The issue of what is and is not within a coroner&#039;s authority is therefore of central importance in the context of this Bill. Yet when we look to the Bill to define the necessary powers and duties of coroners, we look in vain. The least we can do is to lay down some pointers. As a start, I see no harm, as my amendment proposes, in us specifying in the Bill that coroners have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC488"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC488</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

no power to authorise the retention of tissue for the purposes of research into general human health. Various detailed questions arise from this which I could ask the Minister to address.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Where a post-mortem is carried out, blocks and slides often remain on the medical record. Is this a matter which the coroner can authorise himself or does it require consent from the relatives? That is the first question. In a coroner&#039;s post-mortem, could the coroner authorise the use of relevant tissue for audit, quality control and education until such time as the cause of death is established and the coroner&#039;s interest in the body ends, or would that again require consent from the relatives? Once a coroner&#039;s interest in the body ends, if tissue from the dead person is to be used subsequently, what will be the mechanism for seeking consent from relatives? The extent of the coroner&#039;s authority is the first issue addressed by Amendment No. 38.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Secondly, and even more importantly, we can ensure that coroners are subject to the one requirement that will render a recurrence of the Isaacs tragedies unlikely. That is transparency. If a coroner is under an obligation to notify a dead person&#039;s nominated representative or relation but the body or a body part is being stalled, for whatever purpose, under his authority, the coroner&#039;s actions will be exposed to the light of day and the family will be in a much better position to assert their rights at the appropriate time, once the coroner has completed his work.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Transparency is the one <i>sine qua non</i> of a coroners&#039; system, if it is to be one in which everyone has confidence. Even if the Bill cannot go into the detail of the coroners&#039; rules, I see no reason why it should not contain a provision to put that basic requirement for openness and transparency into effect. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40916-53_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I just want briefly to support what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said. I can in no way match the work that he has done considering this area, but it seems rather paradoxical, when one considers the foundations of the Bill, which is, effectively, the Alder Hey inquiry, to find that coroners are in a sense completely outwith the provision, given that so much of the debate in that case related to the product, if you like, of the coroners system.
</p>

<a name="40916-53_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Also&#151;again, I come back to what the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society had to say&#151;there is concern about the tension between the coroners system and the Bill. As the noble Earl said, we do not have access to the draft regulations and do not know what is being put together and how that will affect what we are debating here. The Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society wrote to me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;In addition the issue of research is of great importance to the Society, with the biggest outstanding problem being the tension between the Coroner&#039;s system and this legislation. This affects the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Tissue Bank as some of the donors will die in circumstances that require a Coroner&#039;s inquiry into the death. At the moment they cross check with each other without there actually being a statutory basis for this communication.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>While the Bill makes it clear that it is illegal to hold tissue after the Coroner has closed his files on a case, there is no requirement for the Coroner to inform the pathologist of this, nor is he required to inform the family of what tissues have been retained.

<a name="40916-54_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   The noble Earl made a powerful case in support of the amendment. Although the Deputy Chairman has not yet called Amendment No. 37, tabled in the name of my noble friend Lady Finlay, who, as I said, is in a Select Committee at the moment, it is relevant to mention the points that arise from that amendment. They make me convinced that, despite the force of the argument advanced by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the amendments must be considered with some caution. As he said, it is particularly unfortunate that the revision of the coroners&#039; rules has not taken place before the Bill has been tabled for debate in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The legislation at the moment is unclear. When the end of an inquest comes about, if there is no police case many coroner&#039;s specimens are returned. But if no tissue is retained there is always a possibility that in future there might be a miscarriage of justice. If there is an appeal against a conviction and it turns out that there may have been a wrongful conviction of an individual accused of a violent crime, it is crucially important that material is retained to be examined again when such a possible miscarriage of justice arises.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>There is also the problem that unless material from coroners&#039; post-mortems is retained for study by forensic pathologists or for those in training, the next generation of forensic pathologists will not be able to gain the experience of studying material on which so often crucial decisions need to be made.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Therefore there is some conflict between the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Finlay and those tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It is important that the Minister should, if possible, clarify the situation. It is important that this matter should be resolved and attention paid to this dilemma when the coroners&#039; rules are being revised.

</p>

<a name="40916-54_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I quite understand why the noble Earl is trying to put on the face of the Bill a prohibition on coroners authorising storage and use of tissue of deceased persons for the purposes of research, education and training. Amendment No. 39 proposes a new subsection (4) which requires the coroner to notify the next of kin or nominated representative when material is retained following a coroner&#039;s post mortem.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>We would argue, in the most generous sense, that the amendments are unnecessary in different ways. Let me deal, first, with proposed subsection (3). Coroners are already subject to the statutory provisions of the Coroners Act 1988 and to any relevant case law. It is from this law that the coroner derives his authority, and there is nothing in the Coroners Act which gives coroners authority to direct post-mortem tissue to be retained for research or training, nor have the courts held otherwise. There is already no lawful authority for a coroner to do the things that the amendment seeks to ban; and where the coroner has no authority, the consent requirement of the Bill will apply.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The noble Lord described the practice and the unsatisfactory situation that led to the Alder Hey and Kennedy inquiries and so on. We have tried in the Bill to clarify and strengthen the conditions attached to the coroner&#039;s function, which are set out in the relationship between Clauses 1 and 11. The Bill makes clear at Clause 1(1)(a) to (c) that the removal, storage or use of material from a deceased person for any scheduled purposes&#151;that is, any purpose listed in Schedule 1&#151;is subject to the necessary consent.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Clause 11 states, in effect, that Clause 1 does not apply in the case of activities done for the purposes or functions of a coroner&#151;that is to say, beyond what is needed to fulfil his duty to investigate the cause and circumstance of death. So where the coroner has no authority, Clause 1 applies, and the coroner has no authority to authorise storage or use for research, education, training and so on. So there is no question that Clause 11 might confer on coroners any authority to authorise these things and, consequently, there is no need to specify that the clause does not do so.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The amendment will not have any meaningful effect. We have discussed in this House many times the importance of putting in the Bill and passing only legislation which has meaningful effect. The amendment would not bring any additional clarity or benefit.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Secondly&#151;and this is where we come to the bite of the dog&#151;we have strengthened the law in relation to any abuse of a coroner&#039;s powers. If the coroner, without authority, were to cause material to be stored for research or another scheduled purpose, he would risk being in breach of the offence at Clause 5(2). This is where a person falsely represents to another that consent is not needed for the storage or use of material for a scheduled purpose. So any coroner purporting to authorise retention for such purposes would render himself or herself liable to disciplinary proceedings by the Lord Chancellor, or, in the worst cases, criminal proceedings. That is a very powerful new force.

<a name="40916-54_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The noble Earl referred to the case of Mr Isaacs. Let me just say how that case would now fit within the Bill as drafted and answer the specific questions he raised. The Bill clearly requires consent for retention or use for scheduled purposes other than where the coroner requires it for his purposes. As I have said, his purposes concern the cause and circumstances of death. As soon as the coroner is able to say that the brain is not needed for his purposes, consent would be required. If the coroner&#039;s office decided to offer it for research without consent or indeed for any other scheduled purpose without consent, that would be an offence.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>In relation to the three questions raised, blocks and slides would require consent by the relatives. The coroner cannot authorise material to be used for research while he is still conducting his usual functions. He cannot authorise that, but with his agreement the family could authorise such consent. In relation to the mechanism for consent, once the coroner&#039;s work is finished, the coroner&#039;s rules will provide for that and the families will certainly be notified.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>On Amendment No. 39, I can give the noble Earl positive news indeed. I assure him that work is already in hand which will achieve what the amendment seeks; that is, transparency. We are entirely at one with the noble Earl on that. Against the background which has made the Bill necessary, we have been concerned to improve the entire process of informing and involving families in what happens after bereavement. I am sure that the noble Earl knows the guidance we have put out in <i>Families and Post Mortems</i>. The Home Office is, indeed, in the process of revising the coroner&#039;s rules to tighten up the existing procedures. I hear what Members of the Committee have said about the fact that we have not had them before us. However, I understand that those rules will make it clear that the coroner must discuss with pathologists how long the tissue will need to be retained; will notify next-of-kin of any retention of organs or tissue for his specific purposes, that is, the investigation of the cause and circumstances of the death or identification of the deceased; tell the next-of-kin what options are available for what should happen subsequently to the material; and pass on to the pathologist dealing with the matter any wishes in that regard which the next-of-kin may have expressed.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>As I have said, since the report that revealed the shoddy and dreadful practice which made the Bill necessary, much has been done in the past year to build on good practice to improve support for families following bereavement. There is an overwhelming need for these issues to be handled as sensitively as possible. The relatives will be kept informed of the position and have the opportunity to make any necessary funeral arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>These matters are of particular interest to the Royal College of Pathologists. I understand that the Home Office has undertaken to consult with the Royal College of Pathologists on the revised rules before they are made. A draft is expected to be available by the end of the month. I hope the Committee will see that as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC492"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC492</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

good news and that those who expressed concern will welcome that progress. The intention is for the new rules to be made by the end of the year.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 37, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, the intention is precisely to give the coroner the kind of powers that I have just said he does not have, which we think he should. He may not order retention beyond what is needed to fulfil his duty to investigate the cause and circumstances of death. The coroners&#039; rules will elaborate on the detail of how that will be communicated and families enabled to take charge once the coroners&#039; work is completed.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The amendment would cut across the most important element of this Bill; namely, the consent of the family must determine what happens to the tissue or organs no longer required for a coroner&#039;s purposes. To extend coroners&#039; purposes in this manner could be seen as a backdoor way of reopening more organ retention scandals. So we do not agree that the retention of any tissues or organs should be retained in perpetuity under the coroner&#039;s authority.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The Human Tissue Bill makes the consent of the family the fundamental determinant of retention of tissue, except, as I have said, where retention is required by the coroner for his legitimate purposes. Families will be able to give their consent, if they choose to do so, for the retention and use of organs and tissue for purposes, including medical research. We know that in the vast majority of cases they will agree to that. But to authorise retention where there is no further coroner&#039;s or criminal justice interest against the wishes or without the knowledge of the family would be unthinkable.
</p>

<a name="40916-54_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I am sorry to have taken time over that amendment. I hope the Committee is reassured and will welcome the news.

<a name="40916-55_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   In relation to the last two points made by the noble Baroness, can she assure me that the coroners&#039; rules under revision, as being discussed with the Royal College of Pathologists, will make it clear that tissue can be retained for the purpose of training future forensic pathologists, or is that something which is still in doubt?
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Secondly&#151;a Machiavellian point perhaps&#151;a situation could be envisaged whereby a family member might refuse to allow the retention of any such material where the suspicion may arise that the individual in question may have been directly or indirectly responsible for the individual&#039;s death.

<a name="40916-55_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   This has been a very useful debate. The noble Baroness should be thanked for letting in a lot of daylight on to what previously were somewhat obscure issues. Certainly, when I read the Commons&#039; <i>Hansard</i>, they were obscure. The Minister has illuminated a great deal and given us much to read between now and Report.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, put forward a very powerful case on both occasions when he spoke. The Committee would do well to reflect on the amendment he moved on behalf of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. There could be some situations in which families have a direct interest in seeing tissue, previously removed and analysed by a coroner, destroyed as soon as possible&#151;perhaps where the family were aware that the death was not a natural one and maybe either something had been missed by the coroner or someone had been wrongly convicted of a crime and the family knew that this had happened. So there are perhaps issues surrounding that kind of remote scenario&#151;but maybe not so remote&#151;that we need to reflect upon.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I was, however, comforted by the noble Baroness&#039;s overall message to me that both my amendments were unnecessary in the context both of existing legislation and the forthcoming coroners&#039; rules.

</p>

<a name="40916-55_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Later in the debate, near the end, the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, who is a scientist of very great distinction, put it the other way round when he said:

<a name="column_GC494"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC494</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should be a significant lay element. I think that laymen can offer insights which go beyond the expertise of scientists. Having been myself a layman on a number of bodies&#151;I have already referred to my membership of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Council, of which I was deputy chairman for three years&#151;I think that the question arises as to what is the right balance.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The HTA is charged with providing much of the practical detail relating to the removal, storage, use and disposal of human tissues. It is therefore imperative that it should be able to draw on practical expertise and the experience of public and private researchers, clinicians and other professionals in this area. That I think has been conceded. However, I would be unhappy if I thought that professional people with real understanding of the issues involved in this will be a minority and the matter was, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, said, left in the hands of people who simply do not understand the problems.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>This body will have a hugely important function and role. I think it is important that the composition of the body&#151;the Minister may be able to tell us a bit more of what is in Ministers&#039; minds on this&#151;should clearly recognise that it is a body primarily of professional expertise, but with a significant leavening of lay opinion to keep those experts in touch with broad public opinion and the general views of society. It must be that way round.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I would find it very difficult to accept a body half of which consisted entirely of laymen. That never happened with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund or, indeed, with any other bodies with which I have been involved which have had as their principal objective the advancement of medicine or science or something of that nature. It is very important that we recognise the value of expert, professional opinion in these matters leavened, as I have said, by a healthy dose of lay involvement.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that it is not the purpose of the Secretary of State to give this body a majority of lay members. That would be quite wrong. That is the reason behind tabling the amendment. I hope that we shall be reassured. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40916-55_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I really cannot do better than my noble friend in speaking to this group of amendments. I would just draw the Committee&#039;s attention to Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 in this group. Amendment No. 43 is designed to focus on the phrase, &quot;a professional interest&quot; in line 12 of Schedule 2. That is rather a vague phrase. It has been pointed out to me that it could mean almost anything. Almost any kind of professional with any remotely tangential interest could be brought in. My noble friend says &quot;a journalist&quot;, which is not an example I had not thought of. However, it is quite a good one to illustrate the point. To be serious, the Government might do well to consider tightening up that particular phrase.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Other than that, it would have been of some comfort to us to see a corresponding subparagraph containing something more positive to show that there really is the    intention to appoint people with a relevant <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC495"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

professional interest rather than to exclude them, which is the purpose of paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 2. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some comfort on these matters.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40916-55_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I rise briefly to support Amendment No 43, which is tabled in my name also, and Amendment No. 42. I would be content if half the authority were lay people but I think that the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that there should be proper expertise on the other half of the authority is incontestable. We have just heard in Committee from people such as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, about their own particular expertise. It has proved invaluable already to have those kinds of examples. So, how much more important it is on an ongoing basis that the authority should have access to precisely that sort of expertise.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>In Amendment No. 43, I think that the issue of what is a professional interest is drawn too widely, unless the Minister can point to a precise interpretation that limits it to the point made by the noble Earl. It could be lawyers who have an interest as professionals or patient advocates. All kinds of people might technically be deemed to be in a sense the wrong half of the authority. That would be a mistake. One should be very clear that those who, in a sense, are in the &quot;non-lay&quot; half are those with a professional involvement effectively in the removal, storage or use of human tissue. We should have that kind of definition.

<a name="40916-55_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  I am not totally confident that I shall bring as much comfort to noble Lords as they might be expecting.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Let me deal first with Amendment No. 43, which effectively seeks to change the words of the text describing the lay membership of the Human Tissue Authority, by substituting those with no &quot;relevant professional interest&quot; in the activities within the remit of the authority for those with no &quot;professional interest&quot; in those activities. We take the view that the amendment makes no substantive difference to the definition of lay members. We are not convinced that the change would in practice alter the pool of people from whom the lay membership could be drawn.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>It is worth saying to noble Lords that when we turn later to the boards of the inspectorates&#151;these are the inspectorates that are inspecting premises&#151;they will see that there is no requirement for lay people to comprise a half or the majority. So it is left very much to the process in paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 4 to have a majority of people with a professionally relevant interest in this particular area.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Amendment No. 44 seeks to add subsection (3) to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 and seeks to ensure that the non-lay membership of the authority is appointed from people with &quot;relevant professional experience&quot;. Amendment No. 42 aims for a similar effect.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>We think these amendments are unnecessary. The Government made it clear in another place that some members of the authority would be chosen from those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC496"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC496</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with relevant professional experience of activities within the remit of the HTA. Here, &quot;professional&quot; has to take account of the context of the Bill. We do not wish to be specific on the face of the Bill about the areas of expertise that may be appropriate for members of the authority, but I can assure noble Lords that the authority will contain members with relevant professional experience of the regulated activities. Indeed, as noble Lords have said, it would struggle if it did not do so.
</p>

<a name="40916-55_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I cannot offer any comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on the provisions, which are very clear in the Bill, in paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 2. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State shall exercise his power to appoint members . . . to secure that at all times not less than half of the members are persons who do not have, and have not had, a professional interest in any of the kinds of activity within the remit of the Authority.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-55_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>That does not say that the members will comprise a majority, but it does say that they will amount to a half. We stand by that very clear commitment made by the Government. That is the context in which we are saying, essentially, that we do not think these amendments are necessary. But, as I have said, in Schedule 4 the boards of inspectorates do not require a half or a majority to be lay members.

<a name="40916-56_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   I certainly would not argue against the crucial importance of having not less than half of the members of the authority being lay members. But if the Minister were to look at the constitution of many other regulatory authorities in science, medicine, nursing, dentistry and so on, he will find that in many instances the actual nature of the scientific members is clearly defined on the face of the relevant Acts.

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Without some wording&#151;it may not be perfectly set out in these amendments&#151;there is a danger that people very knowledgeable and professionally expert in the fields concerned with human tissue may not find themselves represented on the authority.

<a name="40916-56_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I should like to add one further point in response to the noble Lord. It will be for the Secretary of State, in making those judgments&#151;advised, no doubt, by the NHS Appointments Commission&#151;to reach a judgment about whether a person is or is not a relevant professional. In that context, it worth bearing in mind that those judgments are currently made in relation to appointments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which has similar requirements regarding lay and professional membership. Perhaps I may jog the memories of Members of the Committee: we announced just before the Recess that the HFEA and the Human Tissue Authority would be merged after <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40916-56_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   As regards the proposed merger, I am grateful to the Minister for reminding us of that. For the purposes of this debate, I glanced through the debate at Second Reading and re-read what is a quite complicated part of his speech. Of course, not only those two bodies figured in the Minister&#039;s speech. He also referred to the Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority, to the Inspector of Anatomy, and so on. This is becoming a complicated menagerie of statutory animals. However, it may well be right for the two bodies he mentioned to be merged.
</p>

<a name="40916-56_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I shall be interested to see the arguments for that. It seems to me that the functions are really very different. The HFEA has played a very notable role in untangling some of the complex, new issues that arise&#151;it seems sometimes almost weekly&#151;from the developing science in this field. That is really quite different from what the HTA will be expected to do. I can understand that there has been ordained from on high a cull of those NHS bodies, for reasons which, as I say, I quite understand. But there needs to be some very careful thought about how wise it is to bring together people in a single body where they have two such very different functions. I simply serve notice on the Minister that that is something which I am sure we shall want to watch.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Earl said: This is a simple and straightforward drafting amendment. In paragraph 9 of Schedule 2, we see a provision which says that the chairman or other member of the Human Tissue Authority may be removed from office by the person who appointed him. Where that person is the Secretary of State, I am sure that the intended meaning is that the office holder rather than the actual individual who made the appointment may remove the chairman or member from office. Secretaries of State come and go in the normal course of things. It should be open to one Secretary of State to dismiss a chairman appointed by his predecessor. This amendment is designed to make that clear. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-56_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Frankly, I am afraid that we can see no effect in this amendment. The persons who are authorised to make the appointment are the Secretary of State, the National Assembly for Wales and the relevant Northern Ireland department.

</p>

<a name="40916-56_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>It does not matter that the office of the Secretary of State may be held by different individuals from time to time. The appointment is made by the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="st_66"></a>The noble Lord said: Obviously, in Committee, we all learn at the feet of the Minister. Amendment No. 47 applies to Clause 15, which deals with the general functions of the Human Tissue Authority. We have had a public inquiry and extensive public debate about the use and value of human tissue. However, it is clear that there is still a very important role to be played in raising public awareness and understanding of the use and value of human tissue. It is important not only that people understand their rights in respect of human tissue&#151;I hope that that will be the case when the Bill is passed&#151;but also that people understand the value of research and the use of human tissue by the research community.
</p>

<a name="40916-56_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>That is a very difficult balance, but once the Bill is in place I hope that there will be sufficient public reassurance for people to become more aware of the value of such research. The new subsection proposed in Amendment No. 47 would give the HTA an explicit role in relation to raising public awareness. It is essential that the HTA plays a role in the monitoring of public awareness and understanding of the use of human tissue. Accordingly, this amendment proposes that that function is included in the Bill. Failing that, other than a whole host of separate research organisations, I do not see who will do that in a general sense. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-57_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   I support the amendment. Indeed, if I had been quicker off the mark I would have added my name to it. It is entirely within the spirit of the Select Committee report, <i>Science and Society</i>, which I had the honour of chairing some four or five years ago. It has had quite a major impact on the way that scientists perceive their role in relation to society in general and to the many different publics that they have to address.

<a name="40916-57_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Conducting surveys to monitor public awareness of the need for tissue research, for example, is the sort of thing that government departments and public bodies do from time to time. The existing powers and duties of the Human Tissue Authority are perfectly adequate to enable it to undertake such activities. We do not therefore see a need for the amendment, which, in our view, does not change the duties of the HTA.

<a name="40916-57_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply, which is rather double-edged: it is like the draftsman saying that he thought that he had got it right in the first place. I am not convinced that it is as explicit as it could be. I am sure that the HTA, once formed, will read <i>Hansard</i> with great care and realise that its duties include that. But I do not think that the clause is clear. If that is the Minister&#039;s interpretation and the HTA includes that as part of its explicit remit, obviously, the proof of the pudding is met.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;non-imported relevant material which has come from a human body, for a scheduled purpose that requires appropriate consent&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-57_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>That is fairly obscure language, but the purpose is entirely clear: to reduce the burden of bureaucracy in administering this legislation. The licensing provision in the Bill is a mechanism through which oversight can be maintained in a way to ensure that the codes of practice put in place by the HTA are observed. They are sensible objectives, which one must have in any such system.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>However, it is of vital importance to future research in this country that the system is not overly bureaucratic or in some cases&#151;perhaps this one&#151;unnecessarily bureaucratic. Not only would that increase costs for researchers and research institutions, it would also lead to delays in the work being done. That could result in research moving to other countries&#151;not exactly the same as the threat from the animal terrorists, but it might have rather the same impact.

</p>

<a name="40916-57_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Of course, if the research moves to other countries, the people will go with it and so will the investment. That is entirely feasible. For example, many of the major pharmaceutical companies have research sites in different countries and are able to make investment decisions in the light of the research environment in each country.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>As I understand the Bill, the licence provisions as they stand require a licence to store human tissue for research. The licence holder, or designated individual, may extend the provisions of the licence to any person acting under his direction or any person that the licence holder notifies to the authority.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>So, for instance, a human tissue sample could be stored in a laboratory other than that of the designated individual, provided written notice is given and the premises specified. That is one piece of bureaucracy that the Committee may consider reasonable.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Another piece of bureaucracy is that removal from storage can be only to a person who is authorised in writing by the designated individual, and that that notice stipulates the use and duration of use of the tissue. The final piece of paperwork is that the designated individual will have to inform the Human Tissue Authority that he has given that written notice.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Again, the Committee may consider that those are reasonable provisions. However, are they really necessary for each and every type of human tissue? Residual tissue taken from many living persons may be put to many different research uses by different researchers, as provided for in the ethics approval. But these licence requirements for each of those uses could be onerous and cause significant delay.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>As is recognised in the Bill, when residual tissue is anonymised it has a lower level of information risk to the donor. The amendment builds on that recognition. It removes the licence requirements from the storage of that tissue for research, but keeps the provisions in respect of human tissue that requires appropriate consent from individuals or relatives.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The amendment also raises the issue of storage of human tissue outside the United Kingdom and the importation of samples of that tissue for research. Surely the Government do not intend the licence provisions to extend to the storage of human tissue outside the UK. Perhaps the Government envisage that under those circumstances, the researcher importing the tissue would need to store it, albeit on some occasions for a short time, and would therefore require a licence for it. If nothing else, we should have clarification of that issue.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The system that I have described enshrined in the clause is overly complicated. It should be possible to simplify it so as to keep those activities firmly in this country. We derive enormous benefit from them, and if the system becomes overly bureaucratic and too complex, many of the companies and perhaps even some of the research laboratories that do this work will find it more convenient to go overseas.

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>This is a small amendment, but the principle behind it is one of some importance. The Bill has been described in other places as being overly bureaucratic. Here is a precise example. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee some comfort when he comes to reply. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40916-57_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Amendment No. 49 is grouped with Amendment No. 48. Perhaps I may speak to it briefly as my noble friend has already covered a lot of the ground. The intention behind my amendment is to exempt from the licensing requirements all activity using tissue taken before death. Perhaps one should slightly discount the views of the medical profession in this context, although one should not do so entirely. However, I know that the profession is very exercised, as am I, about the scope and impact of the proposed licensing regime. I share the worry that the impact has been underestimated on both sides; that is, not only from the point of view of applicants but also from that of the Human Tissue Authority.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The requirement for a licence to store tissue for scheduled purposes applies, however little tissue is being stored. It has been put to me that this would mean that a researcher storing a single spot of blood for research purposes would require a Human Tissue Authority licence. If that is right, the HTA will be inundated with requests which, inevitably, would jeopardise its effectiveness in relation to what really matters within its remit. I hope that the Minister will take on board those concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40916-57_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I should like to support Amendment No. 49 and speak to Amendment No. 50. As the noble Earl has just outlined, the licensing regime is very broad in scope and will have a significant impact on organisations and individuals possessing human tissue. Taken to their logical conclusion, some of these provisions appear somewhat excessive. No minimum is set for the amount of tissue being stored before a licence is required, although Clause 16(3) does empower the Secretary of State to issue regulations specifying such a minimum. On that basis, I strongly support Amendment No. 49 which would exclude ante-mortem tissue from the licensing regime.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Amendment No. 50 goes a little further. Taken in conjunction with Amendment No. 49, it would limit the licensing regime in relation to ante-mortem tissue to tissue stored mainly for use by third parties, thereby excluding ante-mortem tissue stored mainly for personal use. This would capture tissue banks but would exclude small amounts of tissue stored by individual clinicians for diagnosis and research involving their own patients that might occasionally involve colleagues or associates in other institutions.
</p>

<a name="40916-57_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The proposed licensing regime extends to all tissue collected after the Bill comes into force. That will be a considerable burden on researchers and will make the regime difficult to regulate. For that reason, we propose that the storage of tissue taken from living <br>&nbsp;<br>

persons should be excluded from the licensing regime. That would be a considerable improvement to the licensing requirements set out in this clause.

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40916-58_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I certainly do not accept some of the arguments put forward about bureaucracy in order to justify these amendments. The truth is that the amendments seek to limit the activities in relation to storage that fall within the licensing remit of the Human Tissue Authority.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I know that many in the scientific community would prefer the regulatory aspects of the Bill to fall short of research-related issues or relate only to post-mortem tissue. Indeed, noble Lords have touched on that at various times, not only on this group of amendments. However, there are a number of reasons for developing a more comprehensive and consistent framework which is designed to provide assurance to patients and their families as well as confidence and support for the medical research community.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>A number of noble Lords have remarked to me outside this Chamber that the present system does in fact generate a great deal of uncertainty in the medical research community, a point that is often forgotten during our deliberations. The Bill will bring greater clarity to the area. Sometimes we can lose sight of that when discussing elements of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The Bill covers the licensing of tissue storage on the one hand because of the real need to provide for the safety of patients who may need tissue for transplantation purposes.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Noble Lords may need to be reminded perhaps of the forthcoming requirements of the EU Tissue and Cells Directive adopted in April. That, quite rightly in our view, requires regulation of the safety and quality of procurement, handling and storage of tissue for human application. The directive does not distinguish between tissue from the living and tissue from deceased persons. It must be implemented by April 2006. This legislation provides for that directive to be implemented in this country.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>As long ago as 1999 the Department of Health set up a voluntary accreditation scheme for tissue banks which process, store and distribute human tissue for therapeutic use. In 2001 it issued a voluntary code of practice for tissue banks. So we have had a degree of regulation in this area of some significance. This sort of scheme will become statutory when the Bill takes effect, as the Tissue and Cells Directive I mentioned is intended to be implemented by way of the Bill. With that in mind Clause 51 provides a power for community obligations to be given effect. So we are constructing a system covering storage that will enable us to implement the EU Tissue and Cells Directive.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>But the Bill also provides a framework for the regulation of tissue storage in relation to non-transplantation purposes, such as research. As we have said, this is not intended to operate in terms of licensing at the level of the individual researcher, but in relation to tissue banks that collect, process and distribute material for purposes such as research. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC504"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 16(3) provides for the exclusion, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, of the licensing requirement of storage in circumstances that will be dealt with in regulations. We have said plainly that by these means we shall exclude from licensing the &quot;end-user&quot; researcher.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>We know that it is important to manage the sourcing of such material, not least because it will often be from the deceased. In that respect, questions of consent are crucial. But it is not only consent, it is, of course, also the use of tissue in situations in which consent is not needed that will have to be monitored. That is not to the detriment of research. In recent years there has been a lack of confidence among those involved in tissue-based research. A good, supporting regulatory framework will provide precisely the certainty and confidence that is needed.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Perhaps I may just respond to a couple of the detailed points and examples raised by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, talked about the bureaucratic rules. Let me deal with some of that by saying that the stipulation of removal of tissue in writing applies only to anatomical specimens. That is the current law carried forward from the Anatomy Act. It applies, therefore, only in respect of parts and bodies donated to anatomy schools.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of blood. I ask: where in the Bill does it say&#151;in his example&#151;that there are these kind of problems? The Bill places no limitations on consent. If a person removing material says, for example, &quot;Do you mind if we use your blood at any stage in the future in any research projects?&quot; and the donor says, &quot;Not at all&quot;, that is not a great bureaucratic system. There is no problem under the Bill for people to obtain consent in those particular ways.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I think that the Government have done rather a good job in encouraging research into this country. That is not just my view; there is lot of evidence on that. We do not consider, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that the Bill as drafted will impact on establishing research in this country. As I have said, the Bill will provide, in storage terms, for implementation of the EU Tissue and Cells Directive. The similar kinds of arrangements that we are providing for here will have to be in place across Europe. So, we think that the approach we have adopted is a sensible and balanced one. It provides necessary protections for patients but also for a stable, reliable environment in which research can flourish with confidence. We do not believe that the amendments will help that process.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>The noble Lord said: I think I am right in saying that the licensing regime set out in this clause was further extended in the other place by the removal of the exemption for qualifying museums. As I understand it, those museums holding 20th century human remains will now require a licence to do so. I regret that my noble friend Lord Redesdale is unable to be here today in order to support me in this amendment. I know that he has tabled a later amendment which has not been grouped with this one.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Amendment No. 51 is an additional proposal which would limit the scope of the licensing regime to the use for display or storage or schedule purposes of the tissue of individuals who died 50 years before this section comes into force rather than 100 years. This would exclude from the licensing regime museums holding or displaying human remains and organisations holding tissue dating back to the early 20th century, the regulation of which via a licensing regime, and the attendant costs, seems rather excessive.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I do not know enough of the background to judge whether the period of 100 years was simply plucked out of the air. However, the representations I have received suggest that a period of 50 years would be far more proportionate. I beg to move.

<a name="40916-58_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   We are probably now in territory where we would all benefit from the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, but I shall try to respond to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I shall have to track back a little in making my response in order to explain how we have reached this point.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The storage and use of bodies and material from the bodies of persons who have been dead for 100 years when the Bill takes effect have been exempt from the consent provisions from the outset. This is because we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC506"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC506</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

believe that it is important to set a date for exemption from consent at a point where it is unlikely that anyone will have living memory of a person whose remains might be used, for example, for education, public display or museum research.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>In the Bill as originally drafted, any museum holding human remains had to be licensed only if it was not a &quot;qualifying museum&quot;, which broadly meant that it was publicly funded. As the noble Lord pointed out, on Report in another place we brought in an amendment to replace the museums exemption with a provision exempting the storage and use of bodies and tissue from the bodies of persons who died more than 100 years before the Bill takes effect. We are continuing the 100-year exemption arrangement, but using a different method. This will keep the licensing provisions consistent with the consent and DNA provisions, and has another more practical purpose.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Archaeologists had pointed out to us that the Bill as it was first drafted might criminalise the examination of excavated remains to discover the cause of death if this was undertaken without a licence. Determining the cause of death is an activity that archaeologists undertake from time to time. Identification of diseases causing death may help to shed light on past human health, while signs of violence on skeletons reveals evidence of what happened in past societies and warfare. We therefore decided to exempt from all licensing human remains where the person died more than 100 years before the Bill comes into force. Most remains excavated by archaeologists and held by museums will be older than that.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>So, to be clear, we have brought the consent and licensing provisions into line by requiring both consent and licensing for all bodies and tissue less than 100 years old when the Bill takes effect. We believe that a period of 100 years provides a sensible and pragmatic cut-off point, being one that means that there is unlikely to be a living relative with a memory of the individual concerned. We could not make the same claim for a 50-year time limit.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>If the exemption from the requirement for a licence were to be widened, as is being sought in this amendment, in effect, so that a licence would be required only in relation to storage and use of tissues from persons who had died during the 50 years before the Bill takes effect and thereafter, this would take out of the licensing regime museums holding material between 50 and 100 years old. This material would include the remains of persons who died in either of the world wars of the last century, which is a consideration for us. We would prefer not to do that.
</p>

<a name="40916-58_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I have outlined the background of how we reached our decision to remain with the 100-year period as the most appropriate way of organising this provision. I hope that my explanation will satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, as well.

<a name="40916-59_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones </b>   moved Amendment No. 53:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>Page 44, line 28, leave out sub-paragraph (1).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment relating to the words in the schedule:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;A licence shall not authorise the carrying-on of more than one activity to which section 16 applies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-59_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The Bill prohibits licences from covering more than one activity or one activity being carried out at more than one site. A researcher wishing to back up his collection at a second site would therefore need to hold two licences. That seems unnecessary both in terms of bureaucracy and cost. This amendment would lift that restriction. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40916-59_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I endorse everything that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has just said. Indeed, my Amendment No. 54 is very much directed at the same point. It does seem that Schedule 3 consciously sets its face against allowing one licence to cover more than one activity or more than one set of premises. I am not clear why we need to make work of that kind for apparently no purpose. It seems to be a case of creating paper and effort to no good purpose.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40916-59_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I have not been explicit about Amendment No. 55; I should have mentioned that it relates to that point as well. It is not only related to place; it is also related to activity. The individual on a licence has overall responsibility for compliance, but that person would not necessarily direct or supervise all activities carried out under the licence. The early amendment therefore proposes amending the Bill to reflect that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40916-59_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   These amendments all point in the same general direction, seeking to reverse the present sense of Schedule 3 insofar as it says that one licence may not cover premises at different places; may not allow licensed activities to be carried out under the supervision of more than one person; and may not relate to more than one licensable activity.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I recognise and share the good intentions behind the amendments, which seek to minimise bureaucratic burdens. I am extraordinarily sympathetic to those aims. However, I think that the Bill achieves both strength in its licensing approach and flexibility to ensure that the bureaucratic impact is indeed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC508"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC508</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

minimised. It is also trying to ensure that we have clarity of accountability for particular activities at particular premises.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Before I go into more detail on this, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, when one is talking about the cost, we are not talking only about the cost of issuing paper. The greater cost will be in the inspection function itself. Getting the inspection function right is likely to be the bigger cost, rather than the cost of issuing the pieces of paper.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The Government consider that the proposals in the amendments would seriously weaken the credibility and effectiveness of the Bill. Licensing will be at a level appropriate to the activity being carried out, but licences must relate to premises or, for practical reasons, the inspection system will not work well. A single collection might indeed be over a large number of sites and, if there was only one licence, they would all need to be inspected in relation to that licence. Accountability for problems at a particular site could well be difficult to establish if there was not clarity about the relationship between an activity, a site and a licence.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Under the proposed amendment, one site might need to be tied to a number of different licences. We think that that would be unmanageable from the perspective of both the authority and the bank itself, make inspection difficult and probably would be more expensive. It would certainly blur accountability.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Regarding the question of licences covering more than one activity, we had ourselves considered this point, and arrived at the conclusion that the least onerous solution is that which is presented by the Bill. The Human Tissue Authority will be able to deal with and issue licences simultaneously and use a single set of documentation. So there is no reason why, on a particular site, a series of licences could not be produced at the same time which show the licensed activities on that set of premises, with identification of the designated responsible individuals. That is what we are trying to achieve.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I emphasise again that the cost structure for charging for licences is likely to be governed much more by the volume and cost of inspection than it is by the issuing of pieces of paper. If an establishment carries out several licensable activities at the same location, as I said, they could be handled through a single application, a single inspection and a single document recording the various licences. If a licence for a specific activity were to be revoked or given up, under the Bill, that could be done without affecting the continuation of licences for the other activities at the same location. So there will be clarity about the particular activities that are being withdrawn and those which are being licensed and approved.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>We do not believe that the general approach to the licensing system will be overly bureaucratic, but I can understand, because of the complexity, that people might at first blush think that it is. Indeed, we included a government amendment in another place, which is now Clause 43, which requires the Human Tissue Authority to adhere to best regulatory practice and to <br>&nbsp;<br>

Clearly, we will need to reflect on some of the things that the Minister said about the impact. After all, it is the impact on those who are licensed that needs to be taken into account as well.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Page 13, line 17, leave out &quot;direction&quot; and insert &quot;authority&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>The noble Earl said: If I may, I shall take Amendment No. 56 with Amendment No. 58, which is also in my name. I am concerned about the word &quot;direction&quot; in Clause 17. That concern is shared quite widely in the scientific and medical community, not least by the Academy of Medical Sciences, which has drawn the point to my attention. It relates to the description of the role and duties of the designated individual named in a Human Tissue Authority licence. Of course, someone must have overall responsibility for compliance with the duties of the licensee, but it is questionable whether that person should have the responsibility to direct or supervise activities carried out under his authority. That has an over-prescriptive flavour about it. The consequence might be that researchers would be encouraged to take out individual licences, rather than relying on organisational licences. That would increase the cost and administration.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 58. It is designed to draw attention to what I think is a perfectly understandable concern: that the designated individual under the Bill would not have any defence to any claim against him or her personally for a breach of a licence condition by a third party, even if the designated individual had complied with the conditions and taken all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by those third parties. That is what lies behind that amendment and I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the point. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40916-59_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   In responding to these amendments, it may help if I explain how the structure of the licences is to work. At the heart of the licensing system lies the notion of clarity of personal accountability, which is a key issue in this area.

<a name="column_GC510"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-59_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The trigger for licensing is the activity for which a licence will be required. For example, this includes the carrying out of a post-mortem, the storage of tissue and carrying out anatomical examinations. While it is the activity that triggers the need for a licence, the Human Tissue Authority in considering the licence must specify the premises on which the activity can take place. The applicant might be an individual or a body with legal personality, but the licence must also designate an individual who has the primary responsibility imposed by Clause 18 of ensuring that the practices carried out within those licensed premises are conducted in a suitable manner. This means, in essence, that they are compliant with the law, with any directions or regulations and conditions of licence and with the Human Tissue Authority&#039;s code of practice. The designated individual could, but need not be, the applicant for the licence. However, where the applicant for a licence is not an individual, the licence must still identify the designated individual.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>It is important that the licence identifies an individual who holds those responsibilities so that there is clarity and transparency about the relationship between him and the authority. We are here copying the structure that operates under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, in which the person responsible under the licence has clear sets of responsibilities. We have observed that that system has operated very successfully for over a dozen years.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The designated individual will not be a person in a particular role within an institution; that is, it almost certainly need not be the chief executive of a trust, or the dean or vice-chancellor of a university. The designated individual will be a person who, in each case, is in a position to ensure that the activities carried out under the licence complies with the regulatory requirements to which I have referred. Indeed, I would suggest to the noble Earl that before someone becomes a designated individual, they would need to establish that they were able to bear and discharge the responsibilities which go with being such a designated individual. The system is constructed to ensure that people do not get into a situation where they become designated individuals who cannot discharge their responsibilities under the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The person might be a head of department, a clinician, a scientist or a manager. What is important is that it is a person who is in a position to secure that activities are conducted properly by people who are suitable to carry out those activities and that all the necessary requirements are complied with.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Amendment No. 56 would change the reference to other people having authority under a licence by virtue of their acting under the direction of a designated individual to persons acting under the authority of a designated individual. The effect of that would be to weaken the role and responsibility of the designated individual, on which I have placed great emphasis, and to weaken the overall control of licensed activities.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The problem with this is that we fully intend that the designated individual should be directly responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the activities <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC511"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC511</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

carried out under licence. That is clear from Clause 18, which lists the designated individual&#039;s duty. The activities under a licence are intended to be overseen by the designated individual and his authority should not be delegated broadly, as it might if this amendment were accepted. As I have said, we have followed the model of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Amendment No. 58 takes a slightly different line in respect of the designated individual, and one that would clearly weaken the duties that are placed on the person under Clause 18.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I shall not labour the point too far, but we are emphasising that the designated individual is the person who will be identified in the licence as having the clear statutory responsibility. It is important that we do not blur accountability. This can become a particular problem when something goes wrong and leads to a situation which has often itself been contributed to by the blurring of accountability.
</p>

<a name="40916-59_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the point of whether a designated individual would have a defence against a third-party claim made against him. It is not clear that any of the responsibilities in the Bill give rise to duties towards third parties that might give rise to any such claim. If the noble Earl could give me some examples outside the Committee, I shall look into them, write to him and try to give him more reassurance.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment is prompted by comments made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the House. It makes the observation that if the setting of general requirements for the conduct of licensable activity had been a function of the Secretary of State rather than the HTA, some level of parliamentary control would have been considered usual. As it is, what we have in the clause is a delegation to the HTA of powers to make regulations about procedure on reconsideration of licensing decisions. The committee stops short of saying that it is inappropriate to give the HTA control over licensing matters, but it does point out the lack of parliamentary control over both the regulations and the directions permitted under Clause 23.

</p>

<a name="40916-60_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Indeed, the point carries even greater force if we compare the regulatory powers given to the Secretary of State in Clause 16 with the approach taken in Clause 21, where it is the HTA which is given a power to regulate. On the face of it, these two approaches are not consistent with one another but, because the committee has not suggested bringing Clauses 16 and 21 into exact line with each other, I have not proposed this in my amendment. However, I have proposed that any regulations issued by the authority should be subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of State, which at least ensures that the accountability of the HTA to Parliament is a little more direct than it would otherwise be in this context.

<a name="40916-60_para13"></a>

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40916-60_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   We noted the comments of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on this particular aspect. We noted that it did not make any recommendations and we also noted that it was not inappropriate as a matter of delegated power for the Human Tissue Authority to have control over its procedures.
</p>

<a name="40916-60_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>As to the authority&#039;s powers in relation to the conduct of licensed activities, I would draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the duty in Clause 43(2). The subsection states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;In carrying out its functions, the Authority must, so far as relevant, have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice (including the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-60_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>So provision has been made to produce a framework around which the Human Tissue Authority would produce good quality regulatory documents.
</p>

<a name="40916-60_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>In addition, the codes of practice produced by the authority&#151;which are primarily relevant to the conduct of licensed activities&#151;will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In all, I believe that the checks and balances in the Bill provide adequate reassurance about the future operation of the Human Tissue Authority in this area. It is not our opinion and view that we need to have the additional provision of it being subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Earl said: From our debates yesterday, it will not have escaped the Minister&#039;s notice that a number of noble Lords have concerns about the terminology in Schedule 1. Those concerns are widely shared in that we do not want to see any possible confusion about what the terms denote or will acquire in practice. Several of the terms in Schedule 1 have attracted particular attention. I would single out public health monitoring, clinical audit and research.
</p>

<a name="40916-60_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>There is a concern, for instance, that public health monitoring and public health research could in certain circumstances overlap. If one thinks of testing a particular drug for efficacy, that process could in certain circumstances overlap with a process of clinical audit. Epidemiology is the science of determining the prevalence of a disease or condition, and I take it that in normal circumstances such research requires consent. One has to ask what is the dividing line between that and public health monitoring.
</p>

<a name="40916-60_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>If one imagines a situation where a number of legionnaires are found dead from a mystery infection, then determining the cause of death requires consent in normal circumstances, but a clinical auditor of that work would not require consent himself. It is that kind of potential confusion that the Human Tissue Authority should be asked to resolve in drawing up the codes of practice referred to in the Bill&#151;the end in view being that doctors and others are 100 per cent clear about what is and is not legal and what is and is not expected of them. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I support the amendment. It follows on from our discussions the other day on Schedule 1. At that time the Minister stressed the need for flexibility. If there is to be flexibility as opposed to absolute certainty on the face of the Bill, that has to be interpreted. The proposed amendment must surely be the way to do it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   As I said yesterday, I appreciate that the intention behind an amendment of this kind is the helpful one of assisting in ensuring a clear understanding of the terms used in the Bill. There is no difference between us on that. But I shall have to respond as I did yesterday by repeating that it would be inappropriate for the Human Tissue Authority to be given the responsibility of dealing with interpretation when preparing its codes of practice. The codes are concerned with practical guidance and standards and, as noble Lords know and as I said yesterday, the word &quot;interpretation&quot; is usually reserved for the courts themselves. That is not to say that we do not want the codes to be as helpful and practical as possible for all those who are affected by them.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>There is an issue, which may cause some uncertainty and difficulty, about trying to achieve definitions which, so to speak, achieve &quot;mutual exclusivity&quot;. The problem is that the things that people do may fall into <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC515"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC515</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more than one category. That is a reality of life. However, if what a person is doing is in part public health monitoring, that will qualify in a sense as part of that activity.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>In an attempt to fulfil my promise at yesterday&#039;s meeting when we discussed matters, I shall write to the Committee setting out our understanding of what is meant by these terms. This has not been done only by civil servants in the Department of Health; the definitions have been prepared following considerable discussion with those in the field. We have tried to capture the understanding of people at the practical level of how they interpret these particular terms.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>I repeat that we would expect the HTA to give guidance on matters in this area. It is right that it should do so. There would be considerable difficulty in specifying that the HTA should deal with the interpretation of the terms of the Bill, but it can cover them by setting out what it regards as the meanings of public health monitoring, clinical audit and so on. Members of the Committee will see from the letter I shall be sending them how we have approached this and how we believe the practitioners themselves see them.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>If there were challenges in the courts, the courts could well have regard&#151;and one would expect them to do so on past precedent&#151;to the guidance from an authority such as the Human Tissue Authority as well as what is said in <i>Hansard</i>. But the actual interpretation will ultimately always be a matter for the courts themselves.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>So, I hope noble Lords will find the promised letter helpful and will be content to accept my assurance that the understanding of these terms, in so far as some may be uncertain about them, will be assisted, if not governed, by guidance from the Human Tissue Authority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   I took part in the brief debate yesterday on the meaning of terms and quoted some questions from the General Medical Council. The Minister has clarified one thing: his letter, which I hope we will get before the Report stage so that we can take account of it, would not of itself have any specific legal standing. It is intended to indicate what might well form part of the codes that will be drawn up by the HTA. Am I right in assuming that? Because they, of course, then would have some legal standing which could be appealed if necessary through the courts. Have I understood that properly?
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   The noble Lord is absolutely right. Wonderful though my letters are, I think they probably will not have any legal authority whatever.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>   moved Amendment No. 64:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>Page 17, line 10, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   The duty under subsection (3) shall have the effect, in particular, of requiring the Authority to give practical guidance as to how consent may be validly given where desired&#151;

<br>
(a)   generically in respect of one or more of the activities listed in section 1(1), (2) and (3);


<br>
(b)   generically for one or more of the purposes listed in Schedule 1; or


<br>
(c)   for an indefinite period until revoked.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Earl said: Of all the concerns raised at Second Reading, perhaps the one most frequently heard was that which related to the issue of consent. A number of noble Lords felt that &quot;consent&quot; should be defined on the face of the Bill. After a good deal of thought, I have reached the conclusion that this is probably not the right way to proceed. I say that because in a matter of this kind, where selectability is essential, it is virtually impossible to generalise or to cater for every type of situation through a form of words on the face of a Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Therefore, I think that the standards applicable to obtaining valid consent should be a matter for guidance and codes of practice issued by the Human Tissue Authority and that we should work from that point. That is not to say that the Bill should not lay down a few markers for the authority to follow. In approaching the subject there is, as happens so often, a balance to be struck&#151;a balance between reflecting a patient&#039;s preferences for the use of tissue and the need to minimise bureaucracy. The problem with striking such a balance is magnified by what appears to be the current tendency to be as precise as possible on hospital consent forms when defining the purposes to which donated tissue will be put.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>While that has the advantage of avoiding any sort of vagueness and of ensuring that the patient knows exactly what is going to happen and why, it has the grave disadvantage of being inflexible. Should the researchers have a flash of inspiration and find that they wish to perform different experiments on the tissue from the ones detailed on the consent form, then a fresh consent has to be obtained.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="40916-61_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40916-61_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>In many cases where the patient is still alive and readily available, the most that this involves is a degree of unwelcome bureaucracy and bother. Sometimes fresh proposals will need to be submitted to a research <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC517"></a>

ethics committee, with all the time and effort that that involves. But in other cases the patient or his relatives are no longer available to give consent. It is often not only impractical but impossible to get the consent modified. These are the reasons why many scientists in the research community are anxious to ensure that some kind of generic and enduring consent will be legal when the Bill becomes law.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister gave reassurances on that point. However, worries persist. They persist principally because of the requirement for specificity of consent laid down by many research ethics committees. They also stem from the fact that the Bill is silent on the whole matter. If we are serious about the need to maintain the momentum of medical research in this country, and about imposing on it the least possible administrative burden, there is a case for ensuring on the face of the Bill that obtaining generic and enduring consent will be one option open to medical researchers when presenting their proposals to research ethics committees for approval. A signal of that kind would be important for the HTA.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>At the same time, we should not be under any illusions that a standard form of generic consent, which is also sufficiently informative and descriptive for the patient or his family, is something that can necessarily be achieved just like that. The authority may need to work quite hard to fulfil the expectations placed upon it in this area. But of one thing there surely can be no doubt, the authority must arrive at some sensible and workable guidance.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to at least the general tenor of the arguments I have put forward. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40916-61_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   Amendment No. 72 is grouped with the one moved by my noble friend. I endorse everything he said. Amendment No. 72 seeks to go a little further and I hope that the Minister will give it sympathetic consideration. It repeats the assurances given by the Minister at Second Reading, that consent to research can be generic and enduring. I shall not quote his particular words, but he said it more than once.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>As my noble friend Lord Howe pointed out, the Bill does not provide for this. The amendment to which I am speaking aims to capture this provision on the face of the Bill. Furthermore, it is also aimed at reducing bureaucracy for researchers and the workload of the research ethics committees by reducing the circumstances in which the researcher will have to return to the donors and to the research ethics committees for clarification of the extent of the existing consent.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>In addition, where a research ethics committee has given authority in lieu of the donor via the mechanisms we discussed earlier in Clause 1(9), for consistency this method of consent should be equally generic and enduring as though it was provided by the donors themselves for the same reasons.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>If the mechanism by which donations are fulfilled is unnecessarily restrictive and cumbersome, there is a very real risk to the gifts that the donors give, which are <br>&nbsp;<br>

hugely appreciated particularly by the medical profession. Their intentions may not be properly fulfilled, their wishes not respected, and important research hindered as a consequence.
</p>

<a name="40916-61_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>That could easily be overcome by the inclusion of the last few words of Amendment No. 72. If consent for research were usually given to be wide-ranging and long-lasting unless otherwise stated by the donor, there would be a presumption that it would be generic and enduring unless that had actually been denied by the donor. That would be an enormous help and go a long way to relieve the anxieties that the research community feels about this aspect of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40916-62_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I support these two amendments. The Minister&#039;s letter to us&#151;we received it in the Recess and it was very helpful&#151;goes into a little detail in this area. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;The Bill deliberately does not attempt to limit or define the scope or duration of consent in primary legislation, and therefore does not use terms such as &#039;generic consent&#039; or &#039;fully informed consent&#039;. The Bill applies to a very wide range of circumstances and the Government believes that it would not be appropriate to limit the necessary scope for flexibility in statute. Rather the Bill proposes that the Human Tissue Authority, with both a strong lay representation and sufficient relevant expertise, will draw up codes of practice dealing with the obtaining of consent, and that those codes will be subject to Parliamentary approval&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40916-62_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>That is the Minister&#039;s statement and I have no doubt that he will to some degree repeat it today. However, it seems extraordinary that both he and Dr Stephen Ladyman explicitly made it clear that the Bill does not limit the duration and breadth of the consent and so on. It is perfectly possible to have this kind of generic and broad consent which the research community wants to see explicitly made.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I cannot quite see the great benefit of leaving this to the codes of practice, when it would be perfectly possible to make it clear in the Bill that this kind of broader consent is well within the definition. It seems that one is almost preferring to have lawyers pick over the definition rather than make it explicit. So I am very much in sympathy with the arguments made by both the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I think that the amendments would help to achieve a greater certainty in this central part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40916-62_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   I add my support to the comments already made. I should like to put the practical situation for clinical academics into context. In the case of a patient with colon cancer, for example, the cancer will be taken out and histology will confirm the malignancy. In an academic unit, it will also be looked at for things called lymphoid aggregates which may be indicative of inherited cancer. Those are currently at the margin of clinical care and research in that spectrum. However, their detection will not only indicate that the cancer is inherited but alter the necessary follow-up; colonoscopy will, for example, be needed twice as often. It may also indicate that those patients will respond better to a chemotherapy that is different from the standard one. So it has huge clinical implications.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC519"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC519</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-62_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>That data collection is subject to the Data Protection Act, which governs the clinical collection of data. However, when that clinical researcher aggregates the information for research, he or she must contend not only with the three consent requirements but, as far as I can see, with another two regulations under this legislation, making a total of five different consent processes which must be applied simultaneously.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I tried to address this issue yesterday in relation to non-competent patients. I fear that I was rather incompetent in my explanation. I hope that this is slightly clearer in relation to competent patients.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Another problem then arises for patients whose information is in the study. Let us say that a patient is regularly having his blood taken. After careful anonymisation, perhaps double anonymisation, that sample is used and the precious data are collected. However, the patient is ill and may say, &quot;I do not want my blood taken today&quot;. He has revoked his consent to carry on with the project.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>The difficulty for the researcher is determining how extensive that revocation of consent is. Has the patient revoked his consent only to the ongoing collection of blood, or to participation in the whole process? It would be completely unethical for the researcher to go to the sick person who is too weary to continue with the questionnaire and giving blood and to ask him to which stage of the data collection process he was revoking his consent. Therefore it will be very important for the research community to know that, although the patient may stop at this point, it does not put an obligation on the researcher to go back and reverse the consent that was given at a previous point in time when the patient was well.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>So there are two aspects: one is a positive consenting in; the other is the problem of revocation and the extent to which it applies. That is why these two amendments are so terribly important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40916-62_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I am personally very sympathetic to the tenor of this discussion and the thinking behind the amendments. I understand the concerns of practitioners in this area. We are starting to stray into the territory of linguistics and philosophy, and I shall do my best. To some extent, there is also an element of trust involved. I am afraid that I must repeat some of the things that I have set out in the letter because it is important to understand the argument.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The Bill deliberately does not attempt to limit or define the scope or duration of consent in primary legislation and therefore does not use qualifying terms such as &quot;generic consent&quot;, &quot;fully informed consent&quot; or &quot;enduring consent&quot;. As I will try to explain&#151;and I shall give some definition or understanding of what we mean by these terms&#151;the difficulty is that as soon as you put in such words they enshrine, in parliamentary legislation, definitions which by definition impose some degree of constraint. That carries with it the whole implication and difficulty of amendment when experience shows you did not get it quite right. That is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC520"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC520</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

why the flexibility of the code&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has heard me on the subject of flexibility many times before in our other incarnations&#151;will help researchers more than the alleged certainty of particular words defining consent in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>One might ask precisely what the terms mean and what is important about the drafting of the Bill as it stands. Its importance is that it applies to a wide range of circumstances. The Government have taken the approach that it is not appropriate to limit the necessary scope for flexibility in the statute. Consent may indeed be generic and enduring, or it may be limited as to scope and time in particular circumstances. I shall say a little more about that later.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The words &quot;generic and enduring&quot; have become something of a theme in the discussions surrounding the Bill. However, we need to be sure that we know what we mean when we say that consent under the Bill can be generic and enduring. In our view, it is generic in the sense that consent given under the Bill for research can be such that a piece of tissue could be used for any type of research and, indeed, for different research projects.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>A single consent can achieve this as the Bill does not qualify what it requires of consent for it to be lawful. Under the Bill, consent can be given for one, more or all of the purposes in the schedule. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, indicated that there might be different purposes for which a piece of tissue may be used. Consent can be given unconditionally and it will endure unless and until it is revoked. None of us can be absolutely certain about the full sets of circumstances in which revocation could or could not apply. We have to face up to the uncertainty of that.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Consent under the Bill, therefore, is as generic and enduring as it needs to be, depending only on the circumstances and what the person agrees to. Consent may be written, but it does not have to be; it may be given orally. Whether there has been a valid consent for the purposes of the Bill is a basic matter of fact in each case. In practice, the facts of those cases will be many and varied.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The Bill, therefore, has adopted this approach. It is not a &quot;cop out&quot;; it is a reflection of the fact that we are dealing with many and varied circumstances. Noble Lords from their own experiences have referred to these individual cases and sets of circumstances. That is why the Bill has adopted the proposition that we should leave it to the Human Tissue Authority, with both a strong lay representation and a good number of sufficient and relevant experts, to draw up a code of practice giving guidance on the obtaining of consent. That code will be subject to parliamentary approval.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>However, it will be easier to adapt and amend that code in the light of experience and new knowledge, rather than adopting an approach in which we need to amend primary legislation because we failed to anticipate a set of circumstances. Everyone may be agreed that you should have been more flexible, but you box yourself into a corner of this very difficult area of a particular piece of parliamentary terminology.

</p>

<a name="40916-62_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Clause 26(3) was introduced by my colleague Rosie Winterton in another place, in particular to reassure the research community that the Human Tissue Authority will issue a code of practice specifically about consent in relation to the removal, storage and use of human tissue. So, it will be a bespoke code for this particular area of consent. We think that it is inappropriate to go into the detail at this stage in advance of the Human Tissue Authority being established.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, raised the issue of five consent processes including two under the Bill. I think that the answer is that there needs to be agreement to the diagnosis and treatment which lies within the normal process of clinical practice. The Bill does not change the set of arrangements that exist now. There can be a generic and enduring consent to research as well and the Bill does not affect any data protection issues. That is a quick response to the points raised by the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and other noble Lords raised the issue of bureaucracy and the workings of the research ethics committee system. I repeat my commitment of yesterday. We recognise that there are concerns about the way in which the system has been working. I intend to review that and I shall make a further announcement about that before too long. We are going through the processes of setting up that particular review.
</p>

<a name="40916-62_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I hope that those remarks are helpful. I know that it is difficult to try to produce certainty when we have to await the code to be produced by the Human Tissue Authority.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40916-63_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister one question. I am very interested in the theme running through this; that is, of certainty versus flexibility. I shall not pursue that but if the codes of practice are to give certainty, the timing of the drawing up of the codes, the establishment of the HTA and so forth versus the coming into force of the Bill are crucial in terms of compliance. I am in total ignorance of the proposed timing, how it is proposed that the Bill will be implemented in those terms, and how long the HTA will need in the Government&#039;s estimate to draw up the codes of practice and so forth.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The one point on which the Minister has given assurance does not come under his aegis but concerns the coroners&#039; rules. However, unless it is felt that it will arise under later amendments, it might be helpful if he were to give the Committee an idea about the timing and when the obligations of the Bill will bite on researchers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40916-63_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I cannot give a detailed timetable. I can say that it would be very difficult to try to bring in legislation in this area without being able to give certainty and guidance to people on what we need in the critical areas&#151;I would regard a code of practice on consent as a critical area&#151;if we are not to have uproar in the medical research community. The department takes this issue very seriously. It would be one of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC522"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column GC522</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

issues which one would expect the Human Tissues Authority to be working on at an early stage, consulting with all the people involved and ensuring that there is a reliable code of practice before people are asked to undertake new legal obligations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40916-63_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   This has been a very useful debate indeed. No doubt discussions will continue between those who believe that there should be a definition of consent on the face of the Bill and others who are less persuaded. However, I take the point made by the Minister about the undesirability of boxing ourselves in too much by certain phraseology which we may feel encapsulates what we want but find later on that it has hidden disbenefits and hidden traps.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I take comfort from what the Minister said about a bespoke code. That will be music to many people&#039;s ears. The point of the amendment I tabled is that I felt there was a need to send a clear signal to the HTA that we expect it to ensure that generic and enduring consent must be one option in the armoury of researchers, and that appropriate rules must be drawn up to implement it. As I said earlier, the potential problem is&#151;what appears to be a tendency of research ethics committees nowadays&#151;to regard highly specific consent as intrinsically preferable to a form of consent which is somewhat less specific. That carries undesirable consequences and dangers. I think that most of us here are agreed on that.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>We shall no doubt use the time between now and Report to think further on these issues. I am sure that those who were not able to take part in this debate will want to read <i>Hansard</i> as carefully as I shall. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 17, line 15, at end insert &quot;including individuals and organisations that have relevant expertise in the activities to be regulated by the Act&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 67 seeks simply to ensure that the current expertise of anatomy inspectors is not lost and the process of inspection altered. The inspection of anatomical premises and anatomical working is quite different from the inspection of pathology and pathology services where tissue blocks and slides may be held. There is a concern that one might lose expertise and knowledge in the process of a new system. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="40916-63_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   The new authority will have a duty to consult such persons as it considers appropriate before drafting codes of practice. I can assure the noble Baroness that among those are certain to be people with expertise in the activities regulated by the Act. Indeed, there would be little point in consulting only those with no relevant experience and expertise when drawing up practical guidance and standards relating to the carrying on of activities within the authority&#039;s remit.

<a name="40916-63_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Hurricane Ivan</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40916-63_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr   Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>On 14 September 2004 I provided the House with an oral Statement on the impact that Hurricane Ivan was having on a number of islands in the Caribbean. I would like to update the House today, in advance of the recess, on the latest situation and the international relief effort being undertaken. I will provide a further Written Statement following the return of the House.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Hurricane Ivan has now passed through the Caribbean and is in the Gulf of Mexico. It was downgraded to a category 4 hurricane and made landfall along the United States coast on 15 September. It took one week, from 7 to 14 September, for the hurricane to travel from Grenada, to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and finally western Cuba, causing over 60 deaths and severe damage along its way.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The situation in Grenada continues to be serious. The latest reports from the island indicate that 37 people died and over 300 were injured as a result of the hurricane. Two-thirds of the population (60,000 people) are reportedly affected and it is estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 people are living in shelters. The range of figures reflects that many of these shelters are private houses of which there are up to 200. Electricity supply continues to be a problem and piped water is available to only about a third of households across the island. In the mean time water tankers are operating, but fuel is in short supply. This is hampering both transport and emergency electricity generation. The main hospital is working and sustained only minor damage. Drugs are in short <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS122"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

supply as the main stock was destroyed. Other hospitals on the island suffered more extensive damage. There is a dawn to dusk curfew following the looting that occurred immediately after the hurricane had hit the island.

</p>

<a name="40916-63_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The relief operation is scaling up quickly but continues to face problems with co-ordination and communications. The emergency operation centre building was destroyed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane but was brought back into operation by the efforts of HMS &quot;Richmond&quot;. It is now fully operational with assistance from the regional Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency and a recently arrived United Nations disaster assessment and co-ordination team. Roads and airports are now open. Distribution of food and other relief items is proceeding slowly, in part due to fuel shortage and in part due to the scale of properly assessing where need is greatest. The United Nations team will help in prioritising the delivery of supplies. Communicating with the population is also a constraint. There are only FM broadcasts operational, and these do not reach the whole island. The two dependencies of Carriacou and Petit Martinique have yet to be assessed.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>As I reported to the House on 14 September, the Department for International Development delivered plastic sheeting for 1,400 families and water containers for 11,000 people on 11 September and made an immediate contribution of some &#163;83,000 to the Pan American Health Organisation. We have since made a contribution of &#163;132,000 to the preliminary appeal for Grenada of the International Federation of the Red Cross. The Pan American Health Organisation and the International Federation of the Red Cross are both active in Grenada. The Pan American Health Organisation has deployed medical personnel and vaccines. The International Federation of the Red Cross has sent a number of relief flights with basic relief items, including shelter materials. The Department for International Development is continuing to monitor the situation closely, in particular the level of medical supplies on the island, and will consider providing further relief assistance as needs become clearer. We are in daily contact with the Pan American Health Organisation concerning health needs.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The United States Agency for International Development has provided plastic sheeting for 25,000 people and other relief items in Grenada. The Canadian International Development Agency has approved support of &#163;211,100 and the European Community&#039;s Humanitarian Office has approved an allocation of &#163;1.03 million for Grenada. The bulk of this allocation will go towards the Red Cross operation and Oxfam who are assisting with emergency water and sanitation work. The United Kingdom&#039;s share of this European Community support is about &#163;200,000.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The two-person humanitarian assessment team sent to the region by the Department for International Development arrived in Kingston, Jamaica on 13 September. On 14 September, they met with representatives from the Government of Jamaica, national and international organizations, and other donors. They report good co-ordination between the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS123"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government&#039;s Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, the Jamaican Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the United Nations disaster assistance and co-ordination team. Joint rapid assessments are under way with several areas of the island already identified as the most severely affected. These areas include Westmoreland, Claredon, Morant Bay, May Penn and the north-east Blue Mountains. It is not thought that there is widespread devastation but there are a number of pockets of devastation.

</p>

<a name="40916-63_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Until the assessments are completed, exact figures are difficult to come by but there are reported to be 200 to 245 shelters open, serving between 4,000 to 13,000 residents across the island. Water is the key issue in many of the hardest hit communities. Food stocks in the Blue Mountain region were reported as running low. Heavy flooding in the surrounding area is delaying assessments. As an interim measure, the Government of Jamaica through their defence forces have airlifted an initial stock of food to the region. The Red Cross has also delivered relief supplies. Although most of the hospitals are operational, they report a lack of power and water supplies with much of the ground water contaminated. The Pan American Health Organisation is working with the Ministry of Health to identify specific needs in the health sector and resolve these problems. A number of non-governmental organisations have undertaken preliminary assessments to address short-term relief needs. The Department for International Development has received requests for funding support from Save the Children, Oxfam and ADRA. These proposals are being urgently considered.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The Department for International Development assessment team arrived on the Cayman Islands, from Jamaica, on 15 September. They are assisting the Government in undertaking urgent humanitarian needs assessments, which will determine what further urgent supplies are required. Initial estimates indicate 15&#150;20 per cent of residential houses completely destroyed and 20 per cent with major damage. The Department for International Development had already responded to an earlier request for assistance by procuring 3 million water purification tablets, 50 chainsaws, 500 camp cots for children and 5,000 pieces of plastic sheeting. These supplies are on their way to the island, with our first relief flight arriving today. The International Federation of the Red Cross is also planning a relief flight.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The Governor is concerned about maintaining security on the islands and is looking to obtain additional security support. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is considering the request. The Governor is not aware of medical supply problems but the assessment being undertaken will confirm these and other needs. The main concern appears to be water supply and the need to deliver water purification tablets, which the Department for International Development is supplying. A water trucking system is being set up. HMS &quot;Richmond&quot; sent a 17-person party on shore on 14 September. They have repaired generators, attended to damaged buildings and have been providing food distributions. Of a population of 42,000, approximately 3,000 people remain in shelters. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS124"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Food supplies are being delivered to all shelters. The airport on the island is now fully operational and busy with both passenger and cargo aircraft. This has enabled 30 dialysis patients needing emergency dialysis and ongoing care to be airlifted to the United States by Cayman Airways. Shops have reopened. The Caribbean Utilities Company will support restoration of power supplies.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Ivan swung past the western edge of Cuba late on 13 September as a category 5 hurricane. One and a half million people had been evacuated from the area by the Cuban authorities, with 300,000 people placed in shelters. The western area of Cuba is sparsely populated and there have been no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or serious damage to buildings. It is mainly a tobacco-growing area but planting does not begin till next month so limited damage is expected on tobacco crops. Its impact on agricultural installations and housing in coastal areas is to be reported. Airports have reopened and children are expected to return to school this week.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Co-operation is forming an assessment team to inform the Government of needs. Cuba prepared itself well ahead of the hurricane and fortunately appears to have been spared the full force of the hurricane, and national emergency services have mobilised rapidly to distribute food and non-food items to displaced people.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>While Hurricane Ivan has passed out of the Caribbean, hurricane warnings remain in place for the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Residents and tourists have been evacuated from areas likely to be affected by strong winds and waves. No reports are yet available on the impact on the Yucatan Peninsula but damage is likely to be contained.
</p>

<a name="40916-63_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Further information on the continuing relief effort to affected islands will be made available via the Department for International Development website www.dfid.gov.uk. This will include details of how concerned members of the public could help via relief agencies.

<a name="40916-64_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Iraq: Reconstruction</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="40916-64_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>I visited Baghdad and Basra from 31 August to 1 September to learn for myself about progress with reconstruction on the ground. I met Prime Minister Allawi, development Ministers, representatives from the United Nations, civil society and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, and representatives from local government.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The interim Iraqi Government are now clearly in charge, although recent events in Najaf have dominated their first months in power. The difficult security situation has inevitably slowed down the reconstruction effort of not just the UK, but also other donors and the multilateral agencies. However, it was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS125"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clear that progress is still being made. 45 kilometres of water pipes have been laid in Basra since my last visit in February and electricity distribution is now more equitable across the national grid. Partially due to these efforts, the riots that happened in Basra last summer because of the lack of basic services have not reoccurred this year.

</p>

<a name="40916-64_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>While in Iraq I announced a number of new UK bilateral projects, focusing on building the capacity of the Iraqi administration, and promoting employment creation, in southern Iraq. These projects mark an important step forward in our reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq as we move from meeting short-term humanitarian and immediate infrastructure rehabilitation needs towards addressing longer-term development challenges. Southern Iraq should receive massive reconstruction funds over next two to three years from a range of sources, including the USA, Japan and the World Bank and UN trust funds. One of DFID&#039;s aims is to help the Iraqi administration to ensure that this money is spent quickly and well, and that the benefits of reconstruction are widely shared across the population. We are investing &#163;20.5 million in strengthening local management, planning and financial capacity in the four southern governorates of Basra, Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan, including &#163;15 million for projects developed by the governorates. We have also started a new &#163;16.5 million programme to finance employment programmes and further emergency infrastructure repairs.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>DfID has committed &#163;331 million to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq since March 2003. Of this total &#163;78 million has been allocated to bilateral reconstruction projects in southern Iraq; &#163;19 million to support for the new interim Iraqi Government, the justice sector, independent media, civil society and political participation; and &#163;28 million for consultants and secondments to the Coalition Provisional Authority while it was in office up to 28 June. &#163;70 million has been paid into the trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, to be spent primarily on health, education, water and sanitation projects, assistance for refugees and strengthening governance; and nearly &#163;12 million has been committed to IMF and International Finance Corporation programmes for economic governance support and small business development. Updates on DfID&#039;s programmes can be found on the Internet at www.dfid.gov.uk, as well as in the House Library.

</p>

<a name="40916-64_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>As on my previous two visits to Iraq, I was impressed by the extraordinary courage and commitment of all the people, both international and Iraqi, who are working to help the new Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq to build the better future that they deserve.

inform Parliament of the Government&#039;s intention to improve the United Kingdom&#039;s capacity to deal with immediate post-conflict stabilisation, including by integrating civilian and military policy, planning and operations. In recent years, the United Kingdom, with the international community, has been increasingly involved in helping countries to stabilise after conflict. We need to deal better with conflict and instability, learn lessons and improve our capability to respond. Within this broader context, there is particular scope to improve the way in which we deal with immediate post-conflict situations, especially those which include military and civilian components. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development are working closely to develop the capabilities that are needed. The Foreign Secretary will chair a new Cabinet Sub-Committee on Post-Conflict Reconstruction. My right honourable friends and I expect to be in a position formally to   establish an inter-departmental Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit later this year to lead this work. It will have a policy and operational role. In spring 2005 we anticipate being able to inform Parliament about its initial capabilities. Meanwhile, my right honourable friends and I have placed a note in the House of Commons Library which provides more detail about the Government&#039;s aims and plans.

<a name="40916-64_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Gareth Thomas) has made the following Statement:
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>On 15 September 2004, The Secretary of State for International Development wrote to Shaukat Aziz, Pakistan Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, to notify him that DfID has now cancelled Pakistan&#039;s ex-CDC debt amounting to &#163;19 million.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The outstanding loans made by the former Commonwealth Development Corporation to public sector bodies in developing countries were removed from the newly formed CDC Capital Partners balance sheet on 31 August 2000 and transferred to DfID. In the case of Pakistan, the loan concerned was to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The only other inter-governmental debt between the UK and Pakistan relates to export credit guarantees. Following the Paris Club agreement, this debt was rescheduled and is now valued at only &#163;9 million.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>In 2001 DfID agreed to cancel the ex-CDC debt, subject to Pakistan completing the second review of the poverty reduction growth facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund. In the interim, the debt was suspended with no interest payments required from Pakistan to DfID. On 23 June 2004 the IMF executive board successfully completed the second annual review of Pakistan&#039;s PRGF, implying the ex-CDC debt can now be cancelled.
</p>

<a name="40916-64_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>The Pakistan programme continues to be a high priority for DfID. As announced to the House in March 2003, during 2003 DfID provided Pakistan <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS127"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with &#163;55 million to cancel debt held with the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Over the next two years (2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06), DfID&#039;s assistance to Pakistan will be &#163;70 million and &#163;74 million respectively. This will support the Government of Pakistan in achieving the   millennium development goals through the implementation of their poverty reduction strategy (published in December 2003). Priorities for DfID are increasing the incomes of poor people, improving service delivery to poor people and increasing accountability of the state to poor people.

<p><a name="wms_st_15"></a>
<a name="40916-65_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Bill Rammell) visited the Democratic People&#039;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) from 11 to 14   September. It was the first ever visit by a British Minister. He undertook the trip because the North Koreans had agreed, for the first time, to substantive discussions on the nuclear issue and human rights. He met Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, Chairman of the Supreme People&#039;s Assembly Chae Thae Bok, Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon and Kim Gye Gwan, head of the DPRK&#039;s delegation to the six-party talks on dismantling North Korea&#039;s nuclear programme.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>Mr Rammell stressed to Foreign Minister Paek and chief negotiator Kim Gye Gwan the importance which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS129"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the UK and the international community attach to the continuation of the six-party talks. For some time, it has been clear that the North Koreans might not proceed with the scheduled fourth round of talks by the end of September. The Foreign Minister restated the DPRK&#039;s commitment to the talks process, but admitted the DPRK&#039;s reluctance to meet again in September. Mr Rammell also impressed the need for the DPRK to admit its uranium enrichment programme, and encouraged the regime to look to the example of Libya.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>Before the visit, the FCO delegation consulted on the human rights situation with three leading NGOs&#151;Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity World-wide. Armed with detailed information on individual cases, Mr Rammell was able to hand to Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon a list of 18 named individuals, and asked for a full written response. In particular, he raised the cases of two South Korean pastors reportedly abducted to the DPRK from China whose details we learnt about from Christian Solidarity World-wide. He handed over satellite photographs of what appear to be a number of large prison camps in the DPRK and asked for both an explanation and access to them by diplomats resident in Pyongyang. He also pressed for the North Koreans to allow visits, so far barred, by the recently appointed UN special rapporteur for human rights in the DPRK and by other thematic UN human rights special rapporteurs; and further visits by Foreign Office human rights experts. Mr Rammell hopes to hear more about this at the UN General Assembly next week when he will meet Choe Su Hon again to continue discussions. He repeatedly made the points that blanket denials by the North Koreans of alleged human rights violations were simply not credible.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>Mr Rammell&#039;s visit coincided with reports of a large explosion in the north of the country. Having asked for an explanation, Foreign Minister Peak said it was a planned explosion of a mountain for the construction of a hydro-electric power plant. He agreed to the request that diplomats might visit to see for themselves. The arrangements are now in hand. The British Ambassador visited the blast site today, we have asked for an urgent report on the visit.

<a name="40916-65_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Asylum Claimants and Detention Policy</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_16"></a>
<a name="40916-65_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  A key element in the Government&#039;s strategy to speed up the processing of asylum claims has been the introduction of the fast-track asylum processes operated initially at the Oakington Reception Centre and now also at Harmondsworth Removal Centre and other locations. The use of detention to fast-track suitable claims under these processes is necessary to achieve the objective of delivering decisions quickly. This ensures, among other things, that those whose claims can be quickly decided can be removed as quickly as possible in the event that the claim is unsuccessful.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The lawfulness of detaining asylum claimants for the sole purpose of deciding their claims quickly was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS130"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

upheld by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords in the case of Saadi.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>When we began the fast-track process we said that it was our intention to detain asylum claimants suitable for a quick decision for a period of about seven to 10 days. If we could not decide the claim within that timescale, the claimant would be released or moved to another place of detention with the facilities to support people detained for longer periods. In the vast majority of cases, we have been able to do exactly that. However, the need to ensure a really sharp focus on quality decision making, including for example in non-suspensive appeal (NSA) cases the need for a second pair of eyes, means we cannot always make decisions and serve them on claimants within the original seven to 10 day target timescale. While we are able to do this in over 95 per cent of non-NSA Oakington claims, our experience has shown us that NSA claims take slightly longer, with the majority of decisions being made and served within 14 days. The purpose of this announcement is to set out our revised fast-track process detention policy.

</p>

<a name="40916-65_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>The fast-track process has scheduled days set aside for specific activities (interviewing, serving the decision etc) but we intend this to be a guide to how the process will generally operate. There will always be occasions when for operational or other reasons it is not possible to undertake certain activities. This may be because the claimant is temporarily unwell, there is an interpreter problem, the claimant requires longer to obtain further evidence or wishes to submit late representations for example. The process must be flexible enough to accommodate such circumstances. We would not necessarily release people from detention or from the process or move them to another place of detention simply because the timetable cannot be adhered to, if the indications are that we can make and serve a decision within a reasonable timescale. However, the period of detention for making a quick decision will not be allowed to continue for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. We will aim to make decisions within 10 to 14 days, but there will be occasions where it is quicker, for example at Harmondsworth or a non-NSA decision at Oakington. However, we will continue to detain for the purpose of deciding the claim quickly, even beyond the 10 to 14-day timescale, unless the length of time before a decision can be made looks as if it will be longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. Continued detention may also be merited in some cases irrespective of decision timescale, where our general detention criteria apply. We may also detain claimants after we have made and served a decision in accordance with our general detention criteria.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>Applicants with dependants may be detained for the purposes of making a quick decision on their claim, but there may be operational constraints on who can be detained from time to time. For example, the acceptance of families or pregnant females into Oakington may be halted temporarily if there is an illness circulating which might be harmful to them&#151;chicken pox for example. The criteria for acceptance are applied equally to those entering the Oakington <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS131"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and Harmondsworth processes. The principal difference is that at Oakington, individuals with dependants on their asylum claims can be detained at the centre and at Harmondsworth they cannot. Separating dependants on a claim from the claimant can present operational difficulties and for that reason and the fact that it has no female or family accommodation, Harmondsworth will, in general, only accept male claimants who have no dependants on their claims. That is not to say that, at Oakington or Harmondsworth or any other location where fast-tracking is carried out, we will never detain a claimant who has dependants on their claim, even where it is not possible to detain the dependants with the claimant. There may be occasions when we believe it is necessary and right so to do.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>When deciding who to accept into fast-track processes, account is taken of any particular individual circumstances known to us which might make the claim particularly complex or unlikely to be resolved in the timescales, however flexibly applied. The existence of UK-based family ties (such as a spouse, partner or child) would not automatically exclude a claimant from the process as some issues, such as Article 8 family life ones, can be relatively easy to decide quickly given the case law and the individual&#039;s actual circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>We will continually review how our fast-track processes are operating, the criteria for acceptance into them and the indicative process timescales we aim for. This will apply equally to those we are presently operating and to any we may seek to introduce as part of our overall strategy of speeding up the asylum process and making it more effective.

<a name="40916-65_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>During Defence Questions on 19 July 2004, I gave an undertaking to the House to make a Statement about progress made during the summer in the issuing of the Canal Zone Medal to Suez veterans.

</p>

<a name="40916-65_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>As at the week ending 10 September 2004, 41,314 applications had been received and acknowledged, and 14,761 medals dispatched. The Royal Navy is now assessing applications as they are received (5 February 2004 as at 19 July 2004), the Royal Air Force is assessing applications received on 30 December 2003 (26 November as at 19 July), and although the Army Medal Office is still assessing applications from 31 October 2003, this is due to some 4,300 applications being received during that week. This peak in applications, which occurred following my Statement to the House on 23 October, is nearly cleared and the assessment of applications received during November will begin very shortly.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS132"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-65_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>While this significant Army backlog remains, a number of measures implemented by the joint personnel administration team responsible for setting up the MoD Medal Office at RAF Innsworth are already bringing tangible benefits. A new medal laser engraving facility has recently been installed at Innsworth. This is currently being used solely to engrave Iraq medals and over 6,000 have been produced during its first four weeks of operation.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>This has allowed the engraving facility at the Army Medal Office to concentrate its efforts on the Suez Canal Zone Medal and as a result, the engraving backlog of some 1,800 medals has been cleared during the last month. Improvements to the information systems used by the Army Medal Office, the facility to work overtime and the diversion of staff to Suez Canal Zone Medal processing are helping to improve matters further. These measures, coupled with the concerted efforts of Army Medal Office staff have brought about an increase of approximately 30 per cent in the Army assessment rate during recent weeks. This increase in output has resulted in an average of some 120 more applications per week being assessed since July.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>I can also announce that with effect from l October 2004 the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency will assume full responsibility for the management of medal output, target setting and performance monitoring. This will allow many of the benefits of a single MoD Medal Office, such as common procedures based on single service best practice, to be introduced prior to its actual formation date next spring.
</p>

<a name="40916-65_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>Following these initial changes, I now anticipate that the backlog should be cleared by January 2006 and I hope this can continue to be improved upon. I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the single Service medal offices for their part in bringing about this improvement.

<p><a name="wms_st_20"></a>
<a name="40916-66_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Statement.

</p>

<a name="40916-66_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a>The Performance and Innovation Unit report on modernising the post office network, published in June 2000, recommended that the Government should support the rural network in the first instance to 2006. It also recommended that the Postal Services Commission, Postcomm, should advise the Government on options for the rural network after 2006. I have received that advice and have considered it very carefully.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>The Government are fully committed to supporting the Post Office&#039;s strategy for creating a viable and vibrant post office network that meets changing customer needs, providing reasonable access to services in rural communities.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>My honourable friend the then Minister of State for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services announced in the House on 2 December 2002 the Government&#039;s decision to make &#163;450 million available to support the rural post office network through from 2003 to 2006. That three-year package was intended as a transitional measure, designed to help rural post offices through the changes in the network&#039;s business between 2003 and 2006.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a>At this point in the transition rural post offices continue to face real challenges and a large part of the   rural network continues to be unsustainable commercially. For many post offices the number of customers they serve is simply too small to make the business attractive or sustainable. With the prospect of customer numbers continuing to fall as people access services in different ways it is clear that there are challenges ahead and that new ways to deliver services more efficiently and effectively are needed.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a>How and where people access services is changing. It is not clear that the present network best meets those changing needs, or whether because of that the current shape and scale of the rural network is a viable long-term prospect. A solution for the longer-term will need to take these changes fully into account.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a>Against this background Postcomm has advised the Government to review the reasons for and nature of our support of the rural network in the longer term. They advise that the nature of that support may need to change substantially.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a>Postcomm&#039;s advice recognises that such changes must be well informed and that further work will be necessary. Pilot activity by the Post Office, funded by the Government, to test new ways of ensuring access to post office services in rural areas is under way. The lessons that will emerge from these trials over the next 12 to 18 months will be crucial in informing longer-term decisions about the future shape of the rural post office network. At this stage it is simply too early to draw conclusions. The Government have therefore concluded that now is not the right time to take decisions about the long-term future of the rural network.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS136"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40916-66_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a>It is, however, vital that we continue to support the network through this continuing difficult period. The Government are committed to ensuring reasonable access for rural communities to postal and other services. It is also clear from Postcomm&#039;s advice to us that without government funding much of the current rural network would face closure.

</p>

<a name="40916-66_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>I am therefore pleased to announce that the Government have decided, subject to securing any further necessary state aid clearance from the European Commission, to extend the transitional financial facility for rural post offices for two further years from 2006 until 2008.

</p>

<a name="40916-66_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a>The Government will make available up to a maximum of &#163;150 million a year until 2008 to enable Post Office Ltd to continue to meet the cost of maintaining the non-commercial part of the rural post office network and to pilot new ways of delivering services. Pilot activity is a key element of the current funding package&#151;we have already allocated &#163;25 million to fund pilots. Our intention is that this will continue to be a key element of the package going forward.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a>The funding will ensure that Post Office Ltd will have money to test new ways of delivering services and will not be forced to close unprofitable rural post offices because of a lack of funding.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a>Current funding is from the gilts (government money previously received as &quot;dividends&quot; from the company and made available back to the company for certain specific uses) and it is our intention that the further funding to April 2008 will also come from these gilts. The detailed mechanism, sums of money and timing of payments will be subject to further detailed discussion with the company, as well as being subject to state aid clearance.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a>The PIU report recommended that the Post Office should be required to prevent avoidable closures of rural post offices, in the first instance to 2006. Postcomm has advised us that it is concerned that this policy can lead to post offices being saved or reopened where it is clear that customer numbers have dwindled to levels far below what is sustainable. Furthermore it has recommended that this policy should not be extended beyond April 2006.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>The Government&#039;s direction to Post Office Limited to maintain the network and do all it can to prevent avoidable closures remains in place. There is no question of it being able to initiate the closure of offices. However, in response to Postcomm&#039;s immediate concern I propose to amend the definition of what is unavoidable so that when Post Office Ltd is responding to a closure (for example when a sub-postmaster decides to retire) it takes into account circumstances where there is no prospect of a viable future for a post office because of a collapse in demand for services in a particular location. The intention will be to ensure that Post Office Ltd is focused on maintaining access to services in rural areas fully taking into account local circumstances. These changes, yet to be worked up in detail, will be published.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>I believe that we will be better placed to take a decision on the longer-term future of the rural network, including whether the current policy on avoidable closures should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS137"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continue beyond April 2006, when we have feedback from the pilot activity now being undertaken by the Post Office.
</p>

<a name="40916-66_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>I propose therefore to ask Post Office Ltd for a full report on pilot activity and its implications for future access to post office services by the end of 2005. I will then review the policy on avoidable closures beyond April 2006 at that point.

<p><a name="wms_st_21"></a>
<a name="40916-67_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Filkin): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Mr Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>In his Budget in March, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer outlined continued growth in investment in education and children&#039;s services up to 2007&#150;08, showing again the priority the Government give to children and learners.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>On 8 July, we published our five-year strategy for children and learners, setting out how the Government will use new reforms to build on substantial improvements in every stage of education and children&#039;s services since 1997&#151;from the early years of a child&#039;s life to lifelong learning and adult skills.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a>Today I am giving more detail of how the additional investment announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor will support the reforms set out in the five-year strategy.

<p><i>14&#150;19, Further Education (FE) and Skills </i>


</p>

<a name="40916-67_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a>Total funding for FE, skills and to develop the 14&#150;19 phase will rise by &#163;1.5 billion by 2007&#150;08 compared to 2004&#150;05, taking the Government&#039;s total expenditure on post-16 (excluding higher education (HE)) to &#163;11 billion.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a>This is a substantial overall investment, building on the increases in funding in the three years up to 2005&#150;06, which will allow the sector to meet growth in 16&#150;19 participation and enable progress to be sustained on two key agendas: delivering success for all to continue to drive up quality, and reshaping the sector to become more demand-led as set out in the skills strategy.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a>We will provide greater freedom for colleges and training providers through a new delivery structure. This will be based on autonomy and independence for good colleges and providers, backed up by a risk-based approach to lighter touch inspection but tougher sanctions on poor quality.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a>This will enable colleges to engage more effectively with employers by offering the training that they need, and to increase employer and individual co-financing of training in line with the benefits they receive. This is important for the sustainability of the sector and future expansion. We want all colleges to be put on a secure financial footing to deliver the important challenges that we have set out in our five-year strategy. Under the new delivery arrangements, successful colleges will be able to grow and prosper.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a>The settlement includes funding to continue the development of a transformed 14&#150;19 phase of education, in the light of the commitments made in the department&#039;s five-year strategy. The working group on 14&#150;19 reform, chaired by Mike Tomlinson, will issue its final report this autumn making proposals for a radical reshaping of the 14&#150;19 phase. The Government have set out the five tests which will shape their response to the proposals, but whatever the response, the direction of travel is clear. We are therefore allocating funds to build on the work over the past few years to improve this phase of education, including workforce training and spreading good practice from the 14&#150;19 pathfinders.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a>We must support colleges in making the transition to a more demand-led approach in which greater funding comes from employers and individuals, because the training they get is designed and delivered in a way that better meets their needs. We will be looking carefully at how we can best do that. As set out in the five-year strategy, we are committed to incorporating the principles of the employer training <br>&nbsp;<br>

We will also continue to use the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) annual business cycle to allocate public funds in a way that better matches our national skills priorities, including through the new level 2 entitlement.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a>We will continue our drive to upgrade facilities in further education and training with an increase of 31 per cent in capital funding between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08. We will also bring local decision making and allocations for 16&#150;19 capital provision into to alignment. Working with the department and other partners, the LSC will establish a single capital budget for new 16&#150;19 provision across schools and FE.

<a name="40916-67_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a>The achievements of learners depend on the quality of the teaching and learning they receive, and the way in which their teachers and trainers are themselves trained, managed and supported. We will increase by &#163;70 million by 2007&#150;08 our investment in initial training and continuous professional development for teachers, trainers, leaders and managers in colleges, work-based learning and adult and community learning.

<p><i>Higher Education (HE) </i>



</p>

<a name="40916-67_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a>Government expenditure on higher education will increase by around &#163;2 billion between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, taking total investment to almost &#163;9.5 billion. This builds on the significant increases from 2002 Spending Review, and it confirms our commitment to stand by HE in future spending reviews, made in the HE White Paper and repeated during the discussions on the HE Bill.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a>We will increase the HEFCE grant to allow for further increases in student numbers while maintaining the level of student funding per head in real terms.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a>HE institutions will also benefit from increases in research funding: DfES recurrent funding for research will increase from &#163;1.236 billion in 2005&#150;06 to over &#163;1.4 billion in 2007&#150;08&#151;around 9 per cent in real terms. Our contribution to total UK science spending, together with the contribution from the Office of Science and Technology, will exceed &#163;5 billion by 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a>On top of all this, HE institutions will receive in full the extra income they generate from charging variable fees&#151;in steady state (ie by 2010) this will be around &#163;1.2 billion extra.
</p>

<a name="40916-67_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a>HE institutions will start to receive this extra income in the academic year 2006&#150;07. We expect the first tranche to be paid in two instalments&#151;one half in early 2007, and the other before the end of the academic year.

<p><i>Value for money and efficiency
 </i>

</p>

<a name="40916-67_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_133"></a>The total investment in education and training is much larger than the figures presented here. Families have always invested and will continue to invest in their children&#039;s care and development. Employers invest in the training and development of their workforce. Support for education&#151;in cash and in kind&#151;is growing. We expect co-funding to grow over the spending review period, as individuals and employers become readier to invest in better education and training that meets their needs.

</p>

<a name="40916-67_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a>We must ensure that we get maximum value from every pound of additional investment for children and learners. Enabling people across the children, education and skills system to get better value for money from our investment in public services is our aim in the efficiency review. We have identified ways to achieve gains in value for money of &#163;4.3 billion over the spending review period. For example, we will:

<a name="40916-68_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Community (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.
</p>

<a name="40916-68_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_140"></a>I am reporting on progress with investigations into cases where individuals may have been inappropriately denied fully funded National Health Service care since 1996. These cases relate only to matters of past financial injustice and all claimants had access to care services and NHS treatment.
</p>

<a name="40916-68_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_141"></a>The majority of strategic health authorities (SHAs) have made considerable progress since December in the process of remedying any consequent financial injustice to patients (or the estates of such patients) who had wrongly been made to pay for the cost of their continuing care. In December, just over 22 per cent of cases received had been completed. Between December and March a substantial number of additional cases had been reported and by the end of March 57 per cent of cases had been   completed. A percentage completion rate, of pre-31 March cases, of more than 85 per cent in July reflects the amount of work undertaken by all NHS and local authority personnel involved.
</p>

<a name="40916-68_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_142"></a>The NHS has stressed the importance of all cases being investigated thoroughly and accurately and as such is committed to reviewing each application on its own merits. The process involved in undertaking an in depth review involves contact with many health and <br>&nbsp;<br>

social care organisations and bodies, and as such there have been considerable delays in obtaining all the relevant records and patient data. In some cases data and information from aged cases have been lost and, wherever possible, they must be gathered from alternative sources.

</p>

<a name="40916-68_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_143"></a>Delays should not automatically be attributed to the SHAs involved in particular cases. Occasionally the claimant themself is responsible for the delay. Many SHAs are now exceeding 95 per cent completion. In some cases, however, progress has been unsatisfactory, and the department will take up the matter directly with those SHAs.
</p>

<a name="40916-68_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_144"></a>In total, almost 20 per cent of cases have been granted recompense. As stated previously, the NHS <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS144"></a>

<b>16 Sept 2004 : Column WS144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expects to pay a total of &#163;180 million when all the cases received by the end of March 2004 have been completed.
</p>

<a name="40916-68_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_145"></a>Approximately 1,600 cases remain outstanding, which is unacceptable. However, I am assured that all cases relating to living people have been prioritised, and that new applications for NHS continuing care are being dealt with in a timely fashion. My department will be liaising with all SHAs to ensure appropriate procedures are now in place and that outstanding cases are resolved as quickly as possible.

As soon as a relevant EC legal act has been formally adopted on the EU side, the EEA Joint Committee takes a decision concerning whether an appropriate amendment to the EEA Agreement is required &quot;with a view to permitting a simultaneous application&quot; of legislation in the EU and the EEA EFTA States (Art 102(1) EEA). The EEA EFTA states can negotiate adaptations to Community legislation when this is called for by special circumstances and agreed on by both sides.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>Decisions of the ECJ do not have direct effect in the non-European Union member states of the European Economic Area.

<p><a name="wa_st_19"></a>
<a name="40916w03_spnew1"></a><b> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Bach): </b>   An international contractual framework has been established between the four Typhoon partner nations and the industrial consortia responsible for building the Typhoon aircraft. This takes the form of a &quot;Framing Agreement&quot; that specifies the principles for the support and maintenance arrangements, allowing contracts for Typhoon Tranche 1 support to be placed on the nations&#039; behalf by NETMA, the NATO Agency responsible for managing the Typhoon project. Contracts are, however, placed nationally for engine repair services for which the partner nations have different support policies. No specific contractual arrangements have yet been made for the support and maintenance of Typhoon tranches 2 or 3 beyond those also required for tranche 1.
