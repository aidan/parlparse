July of this year. Copies have been sent to all secondary schools in
England and Wales and to further education

Lord the Lord Chancellor for that extensive reply. Does he agree that
it is very important that information on Parliament and the
constitution should be unbiased and accurate, especially information
provided to schools and those applying for citizenship? The documents
provided to schools are not at all bad, but the document produced
apparently by the Home Office, <I>Life in the United Kingdom, A Journey
to Citizenship</I>, is full of the most appalling errors and is grossly
misleading. For example, it states that after 1945 &#147;unemployment
vanished&#148;. And, under a heading, &#147;The Thatcher
Era&#148;, it
states:</p><ul><a name="06102652000728"></a>&#147;The
Conservatives won the general election of 1979 and stayed out of office
until 1997&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000686"></a>Does the
noble and learned Lord agree that not only would someone applying for
citizenship and paying &#163;9.99 for this document have wasted their
money but they might well have jeopardised their chance of being
accepted for
citizenship?<p><a name="06102652000022"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06102652001311"></a>Lord

unemployment, the document should have said, &#147;after 1997
unemployment vanished&#148;. As to what happened between 1979 and
1997, obviously the author was writing about his hopes, rather than
what actually happened.</p>

extensive argument that took place last week among lawyers about
whether a proceeding in Parliament on a Question on rape should be
transmitted or published? I understand that some television companies
bleeped on an unprecedented scale that proceeding in Parliament and
lawyers blocked copy in national newspapers. Is there not now a need
for clarification in some form of publication, and will my noble and
learned friend consider writing to Members of the House on this
matter?</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1279"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000031"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06102652001319"></a>Lord
Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords, that is a bit far
from the Question, but it is a very important issue. I shall not refer
to the specifics of the matter raised by my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours, but Parliament has privilege so that there can be
free debate in Parliament. There is no point in free debate in
Parliament if the free debate is then kept secret by the
media.</p><p><a name="06102652000032"></a>The purpose of the
privilege rule is that, so long as there is an accurate account of what
is said in Parliament, it can then be broadcast or put in national
newspapers. If the account is biased or unfair, that is not right. If
you name someone, as in the example given, then, so long as the context
is set out fairly, there is no legal restriction on it being published.
We need to look at that. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours is
absolutely right to say that it would appear from some elements in the
media that the conclusion reached by the lawyers was that, because it
would not have been privileged if it had been said by someone outside
Parliament, a fair account of it could not be given in Parliament. The
best example of that is that those proceedings were not even broadcast
on the BBC Parliament channel, and that could not have been a fairer
account of what happened. So I think that we need to look at the matter
and that a definitive account of parliamentary privilege needs to be
given in both Houses of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06102652000033"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="06102652001320"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I will return to the
Question. The document referred to by my noble friend does not just
contain inaccuracies; it has fundamental mistakes. I shall give one
example&#151;certainly it gets worse for the Members
opposite:</p><ul><a name="06102652000729"></a>&#147;Labour under
Harold Wilson returned to power from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974
to 1979&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000687"></a>Thus, Jim
Callaghan is completely written out of history. That is a classic
example of why history&#151;not citizenship&#151;should remain
compulsory for all pupils to the age of 16. If the Home Office cannot
get it right, who can? Unless we have a solid grounding in history, how
can we begin to understand and build
citizenship?<p><a name="06102652000034"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="06102652001321"></a>Lord
Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords, I agree entirely
about the importance of history. If the Home Office is not adequately
referring to Mr Callaghan, that is of deep and profound regret. I see
the noble Lord, Lord McNally, nodding enthusiastically, because he was
a part of that. Sadly, my noble friend Lady Jay of Paddington is not in
her place, but the omission of Lord Callaghan is
terrible.</p><p><a name="06102652000035"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="06102652001322"></a>Lord

Answer, but I am not wholly persuaded by it. Over the past six years,
no fewer than 12 journalists have been murdered in Russia. In not a

have the Government made in those previous cases, and why does the

am not confident that it will be resolved, but I expect to see a
serious attempt to resolve it. We have had regular, open and frank
discussions with Russia on human rights and the murders of other
journalists; we routinely have such discussions through structured EU
and bilateral dialogues and through ongoing contact at all levels with
the Russian Administration. FCO Ministers have met a number of Russian
NGOs as well this year and discussed their and our concerns with
Russian Ministers. We fund, through the FCO, projects to provide
financial support to the NGOs that are involved in the training and
work of
journalists.</p><p><a name="06102652000041"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="06102652001328"></a>Lord

the Government doing their best to ensure that the deep corruption of
the Russian army, which she exposed, and the appalling behaviour of the
local authorities throughout those troubled republics are not lost
sight of, that the OSCE continues to pay attention to them, that the
Council of Europe, of which Russia is a member, continues to cover
them, and that we do not allow the Russian authorities to continue to
behave in such an appalling way in that

on Russia, as they are on all others. I may stand corrected on the
figures, but I think that there are nine outstanding issues still to be

fundamental issue and are raised at every

Symons of Vernham Dean:</b> My Lords, many will
notice that the Russian authorities do not welcome independent voices
on the Chechnya issue, on which Anna Politkovskaya was working at the
time of her death. We have given a lot of support in the past to
freedom of the press in Russia through the British Council and through
the Know How Fund, and the Reuters Institute for the Study of
Journalism is about to open in Oxford. Can my noble friend tell us that
we will continue to encourage&#151;indeed, that we will expand the

continues apace, not only in these tragic murders, which have to be
investigated, but in incidents behind the scenes, including much
harassment of journalists all the time? The legislation in the Duma is
inadequate for the real protection of a free press, which is essential
to expose criminality and wrongdoing, as well as terrorism. What will

have described, which go on consistently, Ministers and officials have
tried to emphasise that across the whole canvas of human rights there
needs to be real development and a cessation of the push-back against
many of the NGOs&#151;certainly, in the areas of journalism and
freedom of the press, that could not be clearer. We will continue to
argue that human rights dialogue is absolutely vital. There has been
progress in some areas, and it is critical that that does not slip

outspoken journalists in Moscow and Russia is miserable. Will the
Minister keep us up to date with the progress that he and his
colleagues make in ensuring that human rights values are upheld in the
Russian Federation? We all recognise that Russia is a difficult place
to govern. I am sure that he is aware that a $1 million reward is out

by Vladimir Putin as a crime of loathsome brutality, although I must
say that he went on to say that he did not believe that she had had a
huge impact. We have said that it is a terrible crime. My right
honourable friend the Prime Minister has said that we condemn the
murder and call for a thorough investigation into it. We will continue
our work. As I said, we are supporting NGOs working to promote media
freedom. This year, we have supported a project with the International
Federation of Journalists and the Russian Union of Journalists to
promote media independence and capacity. I make that point because it
is incumbent on us, apart from deploring a loathsome crime, to support

the noble Lord and arrange for him to see officials. I know he came
into the department 18 months or two years ago. One of the key issues
causing problems with the contractor&#146;s proposed approach to this
part of the study has been the inability to put together a control
group. I have not seen the advice that came in last Friday; it is being
looked at for advice to the Minister, Ben Bradshaw. There has been a
complete inability to find a control group of, for example, sheep
farmers who have retired away from farming, because farmers tend not to
retire in that sense. That has been a central cause of the
delay.</p><p><a name="06102652000055"></a>Given the chronology of

there is lethargy in the department. The issue must be cracked once and

explain why MAFF, as it then was, spent four years negotiating with the
main contractor? The design was agreed with in-house scientists and
independent external reviewers. They have been offered 12 different
groups for controls, which have been turned down.</p><p><a name="06102652000057"></a>Why, on every occasion that sheep dip
research has shown that there are problems with
organophosphates and sheep farmers, has the medical and scientific

Medicine in Edinburgh and now this. Is it not time they got it
right?</p><p><a name="06102652000058"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="06102652001341"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I have every sympathy with the
noble Countess&#146;s approach. The only good thing that I discovered
when I returned to the issue after some years was that the work done in
the late 1990s and early 2000s on the containers used for OPs was
successful in that you cannot buy them now unless you have a
certificate. The containers separate the product from the person.
Following their introduction, there has been only one report of an
acute adverse reaction in a human to OP sheep dips. To that extent,
progress has been made, but it does not help those who believe that
they are suffering an illness as a result of
OPs.</p><p><a name="06102652000059"></a>The situation is
complicated further because the alternative to OPs&#151;Cypermethrin,
a synthetic pyrethroid&#151;kills fish because sheep shake themselves
after being dipped. It has been withdrawn, so, at present, there is no
alternative to OPs. However, the matter must be looked at further, and
I will be happy to see the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and the noble
Countess, Lady Mar.</p>

wonderful efforts on this over a very long time. Is it not the case
that the chemical companies, and perhaps Defra itself, are afraid of
legal suits in relation to the poisoning that is occurring? For noble
Lords who do not know, organophosphorus was used in nerve gas in the
First World War. I believe that thousands of upland farmers and
shepherds have been affected by depression and physical decline. Will
the Minister make a commitment that the report that is commissioned
will be published within a finite time so that we all know the results?
What research and development have been done on alternatives to OPs and
the products to which he has just referred, which seriously injure
people&#146;s health on the one hand and destroy the aquatic
environment on the other?</p><p><a name="06102652000063"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="06102652001345"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I said that it is alleged that
OPs affect people&#146;s health. However, their use is widespread: I
understand that there has recently been concern because they are used
as lubricants in the oil used in aircraft engines. There have been
allegations that aircraft cabin crews have been affected. I understand
that work is happening on that, but it is not part of this exercise. As
to the report, the difficulty is getting the work commissioned because
I do not think it will be undertaken without an adequate control group.
That will be the substance, I think, of the advice given to Defra. I do
not know what advice the medical and scientific panel gave.</p><p><a name="06102652000064"></a>This has to be followed through. I told
my officials this morning and will tell my ministerial colleague that
this issue will not go away. On the other hand, we cannot necessarily
blame the manufacturers. Their product was looked at and okayed for the
market. A lot of controls about who can purchase it, who can use it,
how it is used and how it can safely be disposed of were put on it to
keep it away from human contact. However, that does not alter the fact
that there is a problem. The good thing is that since the containers
were changed there has been only one report of an adverse human
reaction.</p><p><a name="06102652000065"></a><b><a name="61026-0001.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="06102652001346"></a>The

Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of
Asthal):</b> My Lords, my right honourable friend the
Home Secretary is currently chairing the meeting of G6 Interior
Ministers, which he opened yesterday. He plans to discuss a range of
issues relating to counterterrorism, organised crime and migration. The
meeting will close at lunchtime today with a press conference. The

hand, which is described
as,</p><ul><a name="06102652000730"></a>&#147;Behind Closed Doors
... at Heiligendamm&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000689"></a>It sounds like a thriller. In fact it
is our European Union Committee report on the so-called G6 meeting
there. First, is the Home Office fully alive to the strictures in the
report about a lack of accountability and transparency? Secondly, will
she say something about the linked and very sharp criticism made of the
impact of G6 decisions on smaller European Union countries that is
encapsulated in the
phrase:<ul><a name="06102652000731"></a>&#147;The G6 should
recognise that they are not the Europe des

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, first, I reassure
the noble Lord that we are very alive to the strictures in the report.
Secondly, there is no suggestion whatever that the G6 group is the
major driver of the European movement. It is an informal group that
meets to discuss matters of real interest that are openly shared with
all members of the Union. The conclusions are shared also. I should
make it clear that it is not a decision-making body; it is an
opportunity for those six member states to discuss from time to time
openly and transparently matters of mutual interest and
concern.</p><p><a name="06102652000071"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew43"></a><a name="06102652001352"></a>Viscount
Ullswater:</b> My Lords, does the Minister not agree
that the conclusions reached at these meetings influence the work of
the Commission? Is it right, therefore, that small groups should have
such an influence on the whole of the EU, now of 25 members? Perhaps I
should say that I sat on that committee and obviously contributed to
the

Commission. We genuinely think that it is an initiative that has been
welcomed by all. It helps to raise issues. Those issues are taken to
the whole of the Council, and all member states have an equal part in
any final determination or shape that emerges from those
discussions.</p><p><a name="06102652000073"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew45"></a><a name="06102652001354"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, I also declare an interest as
a member of the committee to which the noble Viscount referred. At the
meeting in Stratford, will any proposals be made on the important
subjects of counterterrorism, organised crime and migration? The
account in the <I>Guardian</I> this morning says that carousel fraud is
also being discussed. Will proposals be put to the G6 meeting at
Stratford that could result in decisions by European Union bodies? If
so, does the noble Baroness not agree that there has to be proper
consultation with the other 19 states, otherwise such meetings could
turn into a harmful device for the Union of Europe as a whole because
the other 19 will feel excluded from that
process?</p><p><a name="06102652000074"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="06102652001355"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I need to make it
absolutely clear, if I have not already done so, that the discussions
do not involve formal proposals. They are a vehicle through which
discussion can take place. Issues of concern for the whole of Europe
may be identified. If they are, they will be brought before all member
states so that they can be considered and decisions can be taken. No
power is vested in this informal group meeting, so no additional
importance is to be given to it over and above that given to the
diverse informal meetings between different groups of member states
from time to time. The noble Lord will know, as will the House, that
there are several informal groupings of member states, and healthy
bilateral relations continue.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06102652000004"></a>Business</h3><h5><a name="06102652000843"></a>11.35

that:</p><ul><a name="06102652000733"></a>&#147;A Minister of the
Crown may by order under this section make any provision which he
considers would serve the purpose in subsection (2)&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1287"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06102652000691"></a>Subsection (2)
says:<ul><a name="06102652000734"></a>&#147;That purpose is
removing or reducing any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting
directly or indirectly for any person from any
legislation&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000692"></a>The
amendment would remove from Clause 1(1) the words &#147;he
considers&#148;, so that Clause 1(1) would
read:<ul><a name="06102652000735"></a>&#147;A Minister of
the Crown may by order under this section make any provision which
would serve the purpose in subsection
(2)&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000693"></a>In other words,
this turns the test for the validity of the order from a subjective
test to an objective one.
<p><a name="06102652000080"></a>Under the subjective test in the Bill,
the order, which is of course secondary legislation and therefore
subject to review by the courts, can be quashed by a court on judicial
review if, but only if, the Minister is acting irrationally, so that no
reasonable Minister, who would properly consider the relevant
information, could have concluded that the order would serve the
purpose in subsection (2). Under an objective test, the order could be
quashed if the court was satisfied that, on the balance of
probabilities, the order would not serve that purpose, even though the
contrary view may be
arguable.</p><p><a name="06102652000081"></a>The Bill gives
Ministers a wide power to legislate by order, with a restricted
parliamentary process and no opportunity to amend the draft order apart
from forcing the Government to withdraw a draft order and produce a
revised order. The Bill, in its initial stages, was extremely
controversial, and I accept that the Government have introduced new
checks into the Bill to help to prevent abuses of powers. Owing,
however, to the unusual nature of the powers conferred by the Bill, the
further check that Amendment No. 1 would provide is needed. The test
should not be whether the Minister&#146;s view is daft, but whether,
when looked at dispassionately, it is predictable that the order will
more likely than not satisfy the purposes in Clause 1(2). That seems to
be the proper test.</p><p><a name="06102652000082"></a>Amendment
No. 11 applies the same principle to the order made under Clause 2,
which is in a very similar form, and the same reasoning applies.
Amendment No. 13 applies similar provisions in relation to Clause 3,
which contains five provisions at present that have to be satisfied
before the procedure under the Bill can be used. Those conditions are
plainly essential to prevent an abuse of powers under this Bill. For
that reason, I believe that having an objective test is even more
important in relation to Clause 3 than it is to Clauses 1 and 2. I note
that Section 3 of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which provides
similar conditions to the conditions under Clause 3(2)(c), (d) and (e),
contained a subjective test, but the powers under the 2001 Act were
considerably more limited than the powers under this Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000083"></a>Further, the Government intend to
introduce Amendment No. 14, which will add a further condition
that,</p><ul><a name="06102652000804"></a>&#147;the provision
is not of constitutional
significance&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000694"></a>I
will strongly support Amendment No. 14, but I believe that what is of
constitutional significance is plainly a matter for the decision of
judges rather than for the opinion of Ministers. It will not be an easy

and as uncertain as ours. Decisions on what constitutes matters of
constitutional significance will need to be consistent, based on full
argument by experts and with written judgments to which access can be
had. It is inappropriate to leave this matter to the decisions of
Ministers who may have different views. I believe that the case for all
three of these amendments is strong. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06102652000084"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="06102652001358"></a>Lord
Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I support the
amendment. I spoke to it in Committee and there is nothing I wish to
add. I look forward to the Minister developing a fuller response than
he did in Committee, which was focused on the parliamentary process
rather than on the points that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and my
noble friend Lord Onslow. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has touched on
points to which I shall return in a later amendment, which I do not

Goodhart, has said and agree with the propositions that he has

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, we return to
familiar territory and a debate which the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart
and Lord Norton of Louth, sponsored at an earlier stage of the Bill.
Obviously, we have had time to reflect and give the matter further
consideration. For an order to be laid under Clauses 1 or 2, the
Minister must consider that it serves the purpose outlined in Clause
1(2) of,</p><ul><a name="06102652000805"></a>&#147;removing or
reducing any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting ... from
...
legislation&#148;,</ul><a name="06102652000695"></a>or
Clause 2(2) to secure
that,<ul><a name="06102652000806"></a>&#147;regulatory
functions are exercised so as to comply with the [five]
principles&#148;,</ul><a name="06102652000696"></a>of
better regulation. The Minister must consider that any provision under
Clause 1(1) or 2(1) that does not merely restate an enactment satisfies
the preconditions in Clause 3(2) whenever they are
relevant.
<p><a name="06102652000087"></a>The effect of this is
not to reduce in any way the onus on the Minister to base his decisions
on reasonable opinion. We contend that these tests are real ones
because the Minister is under a public law duty to be reasonable when
forming a view of whether or not the provisions of an order
are within the terms of the order-making powers in Clauses 1 and 2 and
meet the preconditions in Clause 3(2). The effect is, however, to
retain what is in the Government&#146;s view the right balance
between the judgment of the Minister and Parliament, and the power of
the courts. The Government are firmly of the opinion that this balance
is for Parliament to decide on the basis of detailed information
submitted by the Minister regarding whether any proposed order will
deliver appropriate regulatory reform and meets the preconditions in
Clause 3, and for the courts to step in only in the unusual instance
that a Minister has breached his public law duty to be reasonable in
his opinion.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1289"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000088"></a>In Committee the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart, acknowledged that it is well-established law that the
Minister&#146;s opinion can be quashed by the courts if it is found
to be irrational, and that argument has been repeated this morning. If
this amendment were to stand part of the Bill, however, the courts
could override both the Minister and Parliament about whether an order
is for the purposes set out in Clauses 1 or 2 and meets the
preconditions in Clause 3. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is not with us
today, but in Committee he argued that this cannot be right, and in his
words would,</p><ul><a name="06102652000807"></a>&#147;elevate
judicial accountability over political accountability. That would be
quite inappropriate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/7/06;
col. 21.]</ul><a name="06102652000697"></a>I put it another
way: it would subcontract out constitutional matters to the courts, and
I ask simply whether that is the right policy
approach.<p><a name="06102652000089"></a>As the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee appears to agree in its notable
report on the Bill, the Government believe that the effect of the
reference to ministerial opinions does not in any way weaken the
requirement for the Minister&#146;s opinion to be reasonable and
subject to rigorous challenge. It simply ensures that the detailed
challenges and decisions over, for example, what constitutes a
necessary protection in a particular case or how to balance the removal
of an obstacle to productivity against an increase in financial costs
for some are judgments which should be made only by a Minister, subject
of course to Parliament&#146;s agreement. They should not themselves
be matters on which the court can substitute the opinion of the
Minister and Parliament with its own judgment. It seems to me as a
Minister that this is right. It is appropriate that relevant
parliamentary committees make judgments about whether a particular
order meets these tests and, as the Commons Regulatory Reform Committee
puts it, about matters some of which are essentially political, while
the court should be empowered to do so only on extreme&#151;to be
reasonable and fair&#151;and very rare occasions when the Minister
may have disregarded the public law duty to be reasonable in his
opinion. The courts should not be able to substitute the
Minister&#146;s opinion with their
own.</p><p><a name="06102652000090"></a>Noble Lords asked in
Committee whether there is any reason why this subjectivity is more
significant now than in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The Government
believe that there is a reason. The Minister, exercising the power
under Clause 1, must now assess financial and economic issues, along
with the rebalancing of costs based on risk analysis, for example. In
this Bill we are now talking about economic, financial and other
practical analyses of what constitutes a burden and what is
proportionate inspection and enforcement rather than legal burdens
which can be more readily identified by lawyers from the face of
enactments as the 2001 Act
required.</p><p><a name="06102652000091"></a>It is not for lawyers
or the courts to decide whether orders are <I>intra vires</I>. So
retaining the subjective opinion is even more important to ensure that
the right balance is maintained between on the one hand the judgment of
the Minister and Parliament, and on the other, the power of the courts.
The important preconditions in the Bill relating to necessary
protections, rights and freedoms have of course been 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1290"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taken over from the 2001 Act. In each case the 2001 Act provides that an
order could be made if the Minister making it is of the opinion that it
did not remove necessary protections, rights or freedoms from people
which they can rightly and reasonably expect to keep. The existing
limitation on the order-making power in Section 3 of the 2001 Act
concerning fair balance is also a matter on which the Minister is
required to have the necessary
opinion.</p><p><a name="06102652000092"></a>Indeed, it is right
that the preconditions in Clause 3(2) follow that precedent
and are subjective. Whether or not the provision made by order, taken
as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the
interests of anyone adversely affected by it is essentially, we argue,
a matter of judgment; it is certainly not a matter of objective fact.
It may also be worth noting that the 2001 Act permits the making of
such consequential or transitional provision as the Minister thinks
appropriate&#151;a subjective test rightly mirrored by the subjective
tests in Clause 1(8) and (7) of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000093"></a>Parliamentary committees can require an
order to be subject to the super affirmative procedure, if it is not
already, and can recommend that a Minister should make specific
amendments. Ultimately, if Parliament&#146;s disagreement with the
Minister&#146;s view is insurmountable, it has a statutory right to
veto an order if it does not agree with the Minister&#146;s opinion.
That is a powerful veto. The Government have also given an undertaking
that they will not force through orders in the face of opposition from

safeguards further ensure that orders will not deliver inappropriate

reasonableness firmly in place.</p><p><a name="06102652000095"></a>For those reasons, and to protect the

Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I have always accepted that
the subjective test is a real test but, equally, it is plainly not as
strong a test as an objective test. The Minister has based a good deal
of his argument on the proposition that the amendment would enable the
courts to override a Minister and Parliament, but they can do that
anyway. It has always been recognised that secondary legislation can be
quashed even if it is an affirmative instrument which has received
parliamentary attention. This goes way back in history because only
primary legislation is exempt from review by the courts. So, therefore,
whether or not these amendments are accepted, the judges will have
potentially the ultimate
decision.</p><p><a name="06102652000097"></a>We are
concerned here with a much more limited question&#151;that is,
whether the test should be a subjective or objective one. For the
reasons I gave in opening the debate on these amendments, I believe
that it should be an objective test. I wish to take the opinion of the
House.</p>

the Bill had a very inauspicious start in another place. It aroused
widespread suspicion and was christened by some as the
&#147;Abolition of Parliament Bill&#148;. The Government have now
wisely and quickly recognised that, despite earlier attempts to
legislate in this way by order, this Bill was not going to get through
Parliament. Nevertheless, because that was its origin, one has to look
at what is left of the Bill&#151;the Government have introduced it in
the Lords in a substantially modified form&#151;with extreme care and
some suspicion. Even with the amendments that the Government have made
or will make, this is still effectively a ministerial

powers conferred and their
purpose.</p><p><a name="06102652000104"></a>Ministers
are relying altogether too heavily on the limited safeguards
built into the Bill, such as the vetoes of Committees of either House
and the Government&#146;s undertakings, which they have given fairly
freely, about what they intend to do with the Bill. But undertakings do
not bind successive Governments. The Bill will be on the statute book
for all successive Governments, and we need to make certain that its
wording and purpose are clearly defined so that it is clear what orders
are to be permitted under the Bill. Therefore, I suggest that we
include a provision that the purpose is to deal with regulatory
functions, as defined later in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000105"></a>The amendment would
restrict the Bill to the exercise of regulatory functions. It is
important that this should be recognised in the Bill as its purpose. I
regard the amendment as very important, and I hope that the Government
may be persuaded to accept it. If not, perhaps we may have to return to
the matter. Why not put in the Bill what the Government have said in
their oral undertakings to this House&#151;that the purpose is to
deal with regulation? I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000106"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew54"></a><a name="06102652001363"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I support my noble
friend&#146;s amendment. Like my noble friend, I am extraordinarily
puzzled as to why the Government have not chosen to constrain Clause
1(2), as he suggests. I can see from Clause 1(4) that there is such a
constraint in relation
to,</p><ul><a name="06102652000808"></a>&#147;any burden which
affects only a Minister of the Crown or government department, unless
it affects the Minister or department in the exercise of a regulatory
function&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000698"></a>I am
bewildered as to why the Government have chosen to constrain the
situation in respect of a Minister but not in respect of other
non-ministerial bodies. That distinction in the Bill is irrational and
dangerous, because it will give non-ministerial bodies the power to
interfere in areas beyond regulatory
matters.<p><a name="06102652000107"></a>My noble friend Lord
Jenkin has produced an extremely elegant solution to this problem by
adding a few words in Clause 1(2) which constrain all other bodies in
the same way as the power in Clause 1(4) is
constrained.</p><p><a name="06102652000108"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew55"></a><a name="06102652001364"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord,
Lord Jenkins, explained to your Lordships' House as he saw it what the
effect of the amendment would be. We understand it slightly differently
from the noble Lord; we think that the amendment would make it possible
to remove or reduce burdens only from those exercising regulatory
functions. Burdens could be removed only from regulators. This would
exclude cutting red tape for the regulated, businesses, small and
medium-sized enterprises and others that make up the essential backbone
of the UK economy, and the voluntary and the charitable organisations
that contribute so much to society. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland,
says it is an elegant solution, but its effect would be quite
widespread. The Government are committed to removing and reducing
burdens 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1294"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the regulated, not just from regulators. For those reasons, we have
to resist the amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000109"></a>Perhaps the noble Lord has another effect
in mind for the amendment. The intended effect may be to restrict the
order-making power in Clause 1 so that burdens can be removed or
reduced only if they result from the exercise of regulatory functions.
If that is the intended effect, I would again want to resist the
amendment for the following reasons. It would be a substantial and, in
our view, arbitrary restriction on the order-making power in Clause 1,
as it would be used to preclude the removal or reduction of burdens in
legislation that did not result from the exercise of a regulatory
function. For the purposes of the Bill Clause 32 defines regulatory
functions, and I assure the House that there are areas of the law that
impose burdens for those businesses&#151;I mentioned voluntary and
charitable organisations before&#151;that do not result from the
exercise of a regulatory function. That is illustrated by the fact that
many of the legislative reforms made by the regulatory reform order
under the 2001 Act, which have delivered substantial savings to the
United Kingdom economy, would not have been possible if this amendment
had applied.</p><p><a name="06102652000110"></a>I give an example. The
regulatory reform order, which removed a law dating from the 19th
century that arbitrarily restricted professional and other groups from
forming partnerships of more than 20 people, would not have been
possible. That order was sought by stakeholders, passed by Parliament,
led to savings of &#163;10,000 per relevant partnership and
contributed, in our view, to the competitiveness of the United Kingdom
economy. This amendment would have precluded the delivery of the
reform, because the burden on business did not result from the exercise
of a regulatory function, but from 19th-century legislation.</p><p><a name="06102652000111"></a>Another regulatory reform order, which
modernised and streamlined procedures for renewing or terminating
business tenancies, led to estimated savings to business of about
&#163;19 million a year, would also not be possible if Clause 1 were
amended in the way the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, suggests. Again, the
reason for that is that the burden reduced resulted not from the
exercise of a regulatory function but from legislation that imposed
requirements no longer considered necessary.</p><p><a name="06102652000112"></a>Looking to the future and the further
reform identified as necessary to boost UK competitiveness, the
Department for Trade and Industry hopes to repeal the Limited
Partnerships Act 1907 and amend the Partnerships Act 1890, in order to
provide much-needed clarity regarding the law on limited partnerships,
which are the dominant investment vehicle used in the UK for venture
capital and private equity investment funds. It is estimated that
private equity investment accounts for 1.1 per cent of UK GDP, with
businesses backed by private equity employing some 3 million people.
Clarifying the law on limited partnerships is therefore expected to
have a substantial and positive impact on investment capacity in the
UK, and on the competitiveness of the economy as a whole.</p><p><a name="06102652000113"></a>Business has sought
this reform to ensure that limited partnerships remain attractive
vehicles for venture 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1295"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capital investment in the UK in an increasingly competitive market.
Businesses have told us that they believe these reforms will maintain
the UK&#146;s pre-eminent position within Europe. The reform is
likely to have a substantial and positive effect on our
competitiveness, precisely the kind of reform orders we should be able
to deliver. Yet the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would preclude any
such reform, because again in this instance the burden is neither on a
regulator nor from the exercise of a regulatory function, but the
result of outdated legislation. If I have properly understood the
intended effect of the amendment, such reforms, despite their clear
benefit to our economy, would not be possible because they remove
burdens arising from legislation and not from the exercise of a
regulatory function or from a regulator.</p><p><a name="06102652000114"></a>In summary, either of these restrictions
would be arbitrary and would preclude a Minister from reducing or
removing burdens that were sensible, desired and sought by business and
by those in the voluntary and charitable sector. So, for those very
practical, hard-nosed reasons, which could have a serious consequence
if we were to go down this route, and notwithstanding the elegance of
the amendment, I invite the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, to withdraw
it.</p><h5><a name="06102652000847"></a>12.15

end.</p><p><a name="06102652000116"></a>I have
listened to the Minister with care and I think he is construing
regulatory functions altogether too narrowly. I would have thought all
the examples that he has quoted are of statutory regulation. He quoted
the Partnerships Act; it was intended to regulate the function of
lawyers. I will certainly look at the wording again but, as I said in
moving the amendment, the Bill lacks a clear statement of its purpose.
The Government have said that its purpose is to lift the burdens of
regulation. We support that, but our fear is that, without that being
clearly stated at the beginning of the Bill, there will be a temptation
for Governments faced with a congested parliamentary
programme&#151;as all Governments have been, certainly those I have
been a member of&#151;to say, &#147;Why can&#146;t we do this by
order under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act?&#148;. That is
what we want to avoid.</p><p><a name="06102652000117"></a>I want to
come back to this at a later stage, having considered what the noble
Lord has said, but my noble friends on the Front Bench and I attach a
good deal of importance to what we are trying to achieve here. I beg
leave to withdraw the

but one which provides a specific response to points made by noble
Lords in Committee. The amendment makes explicit that which is implicit
in the present draft of the Bill; namely, that the ability to remove
sanctions for doing or not doing something in the course of an activity
does not permit the removal of sanctions from activities such as
drug-dealing, people-trafficking or other unlawful
activities.</p><p><a name="06102652000122"></a>This is an important
and essential safeguard against any inappropriate use of the
order-making power and should ensure that any change to sanctions for
unlawful activity must be delivered by primary legislation, subject to
detailed parliamentary
debate.</p><p><a name="06102652000123"></a>It is possible, by
order, to repeal offences, or reduce or remove sanctions for offences
which relate to the carrying-on of any lawful activity. This is not new
and was possible under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It has been
shown to be a necessary power to deliver better regulation so that
offences can be repealed and sanctions reduced or removed where they
are no longer considered to be targeted or
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102652000124"></a>The Bill also
carries over the ability under the present legislation by order to
replace sanctions with new sanctions, or to create a new offence that
is punishable on indictment up to a limit of two years&#146;
imprisonment. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06102652000125"></a>On

words,</p><ul><a name="06102652000809"></a>&#147;unless it

function&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000129"></a>The 2001
Act specifically excluded any burden that affects only a Minister of
the Crown or government department. The Explanatory Notes to that Act
explained that it allowed for the relieving of burdens from anyone,
including Ministers and government
departments,</p><ul><a name="06102652000810"></a>&#147;but not
where only they would
benefit&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000699"></a>Those are
the crucial words. That provision is not repeated in the Bill that is
before us. It is not right that Ministers or central government
departments should be, as it were, self-lawmaking in the exercise of
their own regulatory functions in removing burdens from themselves.
That is not what the measure is supposed to be about; it is about
removing burdens from the economy, business and those who are affected
by regulation. When the Hampton committee reviewed this matter, it
indicated that in practice it may be possible in most cases to find a
third party who was affected, so that the reforms were not for the sole
benefit of the Minister or department. I understand that there have
been some examples of that under the provisions of the 2001 Act.
However, it may not always be the
case.<p><a name="06102652000130"></a>I should have thought

government department or Minister, no doubt for very good reason, it is
not right that a Minister should come along later with an order and
say, &#147;We do not want it to apply to us&#148;, which is the
effect of the measure. That is not right. We should retain the
distinction that was made in the 2001 Act that the power cannot be used
where only Ministers and their departments would benefit. I hope that
on reflection the Minister will accept that. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000131"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="06102652001368"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for moving the amendment. I am slightly
intrigued, as I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;who
is not present at the moment&#151;was rather keen on this provision,
but I let that
rest.</p><p><a name="06102652000132"></a>The
amendment would rule out altogether orders being able to remove or
reduce burdens that affect only a Minister or government
department. Clause 1(4) makes it clear that burdens that fall
only on a Minister or government department may be removed only in the
narrow situation where the burden affects the Minister or department in
the exercise of one of its regulatory functions. The provision is
therefore a safeguard that ensures that, for instance, it will not be
possible to make an order that reforms the provision of public services
such as healthcare or education because it is considered a financial
cost and therefore a burden on the Government. It is right that orders
should not be able to make such reform of the provision of public
services. However, I cannot see that it is sensible to prevent orders
from making sensible reforms in relation to those regulatory functions
that government departments
exercise.</p><p><a name="06102652000133"></a>As
the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, knows, departments carry out a number of
regulatory functions, such as the company law regulatory functions
within DTI, or the regulatory functions exercised by the Pesticides
Safety Directorate as part of Defra. It is the Government&#146;s view
that their regulatory functions should be conducted in as
cost-effective and efficient way as regulatory functions exercised by
other independent regulators are.</p><p><a name="06102652000134"></a>The Government believe that orders should
be able to remove or reduce burdens from departments where they are
carrying out regulatory functions, in the same way as orders can for
other regulators. So, for instance, it should be possible for orders to
make changes that reduce the cost or administrative inconvenience for a
department exercising its regulatory functions. Where there is a need
to make regulatory functions more efficient or to reduce administrative
burden and costs for them arising from legislation, it should be
possible to do that by order. Whether or not the particular regulatory
function is part of a department should be irrelevant. For example, it
should be possible to remove an obstacle to the efficiency of Companies
House by order, just as it would be possible in relation to the
efficiency of the Environment Agency.</p><p><a name="06102652000135"></a>In summary, making an
arbitrary distinction between regulatory functions exercised by
government departments, where the Government are the regulators, and
those

proposes, cannot logically be right. For those reasons, I suggest that
the noble Lord might consider withdrawing his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000136"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="06102652001369"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I have listened
carefully to what the Minister has said. I would have thought that in
all the examples that he gave there would clearly be burdens on other
people and, therefore, there could be no difficulty with making orders
under the Bill to reduce those burdens. I am concerned about cases
where Parliament has imposed a clear burden on a government department
for a particular purpose, but where the Government are now trying to
relieve themselves of that obligation. However, I will consider what
the noble Lord has said. Perhaps I may need to come back to this at a
later stage but, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000137"></a>Amendment, by leave,

not in force) which was passed at least one year before the day on
which the order is

noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment seeks to bring back a
provision from the 2001 Act&#151;that an order cannot be made too
soon after the Act or regulation has been passed. The argument is that
time should be given to see whether the order is effective or
burdensome. The 2001 Act stated that an order could not be made for two
years and I can understand that that may well have been considered too
restrictive. Therefore, in the amendment I suggest that a period of one
year would be sufficient.</p><p><a name="06102652000141"></a>It
takes time after Parliament has passed a Bill, created an Act and
approved regulations to assess what the effects actually are. Is the
order over-burdensome, in which case it should be amended, or does it
achieve its purpose without imposing unreasonable or disproportionate
burdens? My amendment would give the Government an opportunity to take
stock for a short time. It seems absurd to be able to pass a regulation
and then, within a few weeks or months, say, &#147;Oh well, we got it
all wrong and we now want to make an order to amend it or remove
it&#148;. That would not smack of good government and a year seems to
be a reasonable period to allow the Act or order to have an effect. If
it then appears to impose an unreasonable or disproportionate burden,
as set out in the Bill, an order can be brought forward. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000142"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew62"></a><a name="06102652001371"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I shall deal with
both amendments in the group together. The noble Lord has described
them well. They would move the order-making power in Part 1 of the Bill
back in the direction of the 2001 Act by providing for a similar
provision to the two-year rule. While the 2001 Act has enabled some 30
worthwhile reforms, it has proved ineffective for a number of reasons.
This is why we are discussing this new Bill, which moves away from the
prescriptive nature of the 2001 Act, 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1299"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and it is why the Government cannot support this amendment. We want to
avoid imposing unnecessary and arbitrary restrictions on the
order-making process, which is what the amendment would do.</p><p><a name="06102652000143"></a>One example of the
negative effect of the two-year rule in the 2001 Act was in relation to
the Regulatory Reform (Gaming Machines) Order 2003. This order
was originally expected to save that industry &#163;9.5 million
annually. Unfortunately, part of the proposals had to be dropped
because it was prevented by the two-year rule, as the relevant
provisions had been amended by a prize uprating order, which is
occasionally necessary to increase the maximum amount that certain
gaming machines can pay out. Dropping this part of the proposals
reduced the estimated savings to the gaming machines industry by
&#163;1.85 million annually.</p><p><a name="06102652000144"></a>I recognise that the amendment would be
less restrictive than the two-year rule in the 2001 Act, but we do not
wish the Bill to prevent businesses, the public and voluntary sectors
from benefiting fully from the Government&#146;s regulatory reform
proposals. As I am sure the noble Lord is aware, every order under Part
1 is subject to statutory consultation, and the results of that
consultation will influence both the Minister and Parliament in coming
to a decision on the content of the draft order that is laid and on the
appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for that order. The results
will also influence whether Parliament wishes to approve the order or
whether it exercises its right to veto it. Surely that is a
satisfactory degree of scrutiny for any potential proposal that might
seek substantively to amend legislation that is less than a year
old.</p><h5><a name="06102652000848"></a>12.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000145"></a>I recognise
that the noble Lord is seeking to ensure that the amendments encourage
the Government to produce well thought-out legislation that should not
need to be amended within a year of it being enacted. However, although
he is as eager as we are to improve the way that we make policy, I do
not believe that this amendment is the appropriate mechanism for doing
so. I remind the House that the Government continue to review the way
that policy is made and that the Better Regulation Executive is
currently developing proposals to improve the effectiveness of the
regulatory impact assessment process. We continue to review
legislation, and we have given an undertaking to review this Bill no
more than five years after it is
enacted.</p><p><a name="06102652000146"></a>I am
sympathetic to the noble Lord and understand that he does not wish to
encourage sloppiness in the drafting of measures or in the way in which
they are brought forward or introduced. However, we all have to accept
that from time to time a law of unintended consequences is at work in
legislation. Although the noble Lord does not seek to impose as
rigorous an approach as was contained within the 2001 Act,
nevertheless, I continue to hold that the amendment would be an
unnecessary restraint on improving the process and ensuring that we
have a genuinely deregulatory approach. For those reasons, I hope that
the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

into the Interpretation Act 1978 by Clause 26(1) of the Bill. That
would simplify the definition to be inserted into the Scotland Act

of course been agreed with the Scottish
Executive.</p><p><a name="06102652000153"></a>The purpose of
subsections (1) and (3) of Clause 26 is, among other things,
to amend the Interpretation Act and the Scotland Act order respectively
by inserting a new standard definition of &#147;EEA
agreement&#148;, which means that references in domestic legislation
to the EEA agreement will automatically be to the most up-to-date
version of that agreement. The definition of &#147;EEA
agreement&#148; to be inserted into subsection (1)(a) will allow Acts
of Parliament, and subordinate legislation made under them, to refer
automatically to the most up-to-date version of the EEA agreement. The
definition of &#147;EEA agreement&#148; to be inserted into the

resulted from the existence in domestic legislation of two differently

to time modified or supplemented by or under the Community

<p><a name="06102652000155"></a>The current definition to be inserted
into the Scotland Act order refers to the agreement on the EEA signed
at Oporto, together with the protocol signed at Brussels, as from time
to time modified or supplemented by or under the Community treaties.
That definition works because any modification of the agreement that is
not a Community treaty can be designated as one under Section 1(3) of
the European Communities Act 1972. However, this is cumbersome, as it
requires the making of an Order in Council. The amendment would make
the definition simpler and would remove the need for an Order in
Council by removing the reference to &#147;Community Treaties&#148;
and allowing the definition of &#147;EEA agreement&#148; to capture
all amendments and modifications to the agreement without the need for
an Order in Council.</p><p><a name="06102652000156"></a>I now turn
to two final minor and technical amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 38
and 41&#151;which have been agreed with the Department for Social
Development in Northern Ireland. They are intended simply to update a
reference in the Deregulation and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland)
Order 1996 so that it refers to Sections 1 or 2 of the Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Act 2006, rather than Section 1 of the Regulatory
Reform Act 2001. Article 17(1) of the order refers to Section 1 of the
Regulatory Reform Act 2001. As the LRRB is repealing and replacing that
Act, the reference in Article 17 will need to be updated to refer to
Sections 1 or 2 of the 2006
Act.</p><p><a name="06102652000157"></a>Article 17 enables the
Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland to maintain
parity with the DWP in the field of child support, social security and
pensions. These amendments would simply enable that to continue to be
the case. The principle of parity in the field of social security,
child support and pensions is enshrined in Section 87 of the Northern
Ireland Act 1998. In effect, that means that benefits should be
available throughout the UK at the same rate and be subject to the same
conditions of entitlement. An example of where the power in Article 17
was used to maintain parity in this way was the Deregulation
(Carer&#146;s Allowance) Order (Northern Ireland) 2002. This order
renamed the invalid care allowance and made a number of other changes
to the renamed carer&#146;s allowance in line with the changes made
by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the Regulatory
Reform (Carer&#146;s Allowance) Order 2002. I ask noble Lords to
accept these technical amendments. I beg to
move.</p>

14 creates a new precondition, which prevents a Minister from making
provision in an order which he considers constitutionally significant.
The only exception to this is that orders may restate constitutionally
significant provisions, but only where this would make the law more
accessible or easily understood. I am sure that noble Lords would agree
that that is a highly desirable
objective.</p><p><a name="06102652000176"></a>The
order-making powers in Part 1 are clearly focused on delivering better
regulation, as we have explained to the House many times before. There
are already important safeguards in the Bill, as we have made clear,
such as the existing preconditions and restrictions in Clauses 3 to 11,
the public consultation required by Clause 13, and the parliamentary
procedures provided for in Clauses 12 and 14 to 18, including
Parliament&#146;s statutory veto. The Government have also undertaken
not to use the order-making powers to make highly controversial
changes.</p><p><a name="06102652000177"></a>Given all these
protections, can the order-making powers in Clauses 1 and 2 be used to
deliver significant constitutional change? The Government&#146;s view
is that they cannot. We are supported in our view by the reports of the
Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform and the
Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. The committees
said that the powers in Clauses 1 and 2 were not
inappropriate.</p><p><a name="06102652000178"></a>However, after
our debates in Committee it was apparent that concerns remained that
the order-making powers could be used to bring about fundamental
constitutional change. The Government are clear that those concerns are
misplaced and that the Bill could not be used to make such
constitutional changes. We have, however, listened to those concerns
and tabled this amendment to put the issue beyond any possible or
reasonable doubt.</p><p><a name="06102652000179"></a>If this
amendment is agreed to, it will be added to the other preconditions

delivering better regulation. It is important that we should not create
new arbitrary restrictions. Amendment No. 14 is targeted on making
clear that the Bill cannot be used for the delivery of significant
constitutional reform by order, but will not prevent the use of orders
to deliver better regulation.</p><p><a name="06102652000181"></a>For instance, the precondition in
Amendment No. 14 permits the amendment of statutes that might
be thought of as &#147;constitutional&#148; merely to reform, say,
requirements to serve a notice which were administratively
inconvenient, where that minor but worthwhile reform was not
constitutionally significant and met the other preconditions, including
those protecting necessary protections, rights and freedoms.</p><p><a name="06102652000182"></a>Similarly, the new precondition in
Amendment No. 14 will permit trivial or consequential
amendments to be made to statutes that are constitutional in nature,
for example by allowing the correction of cross references to other
Acts or names which have been changed. A further benefit of the
precondition is that, as with the other preconditions in Clause 3, it
is right for the Minister to have to make this judgment&#151;although
the judgment is also rightly subject to various safeguards and checks.
It is the Minister who promotes the order, and therefore he who must be
satisfied before he does so that what he is proposing is within his
powers. But, to comply with the public law duties placed on him, the
Minister&#146;s opinion must be reasonable and this may be challenged
through the courts.</p><p><a name="06102652000183"></a>Once the
Minister has taken a view on the proposals, they will then go out for
statutory public consultation, as required by Clause 13. Consultees
will have an opportunity to comment on all aspects of the proposals,
which could include whether they believe the proposal is
constitutionally significant. The Government have made a commitment not
to deliver highly controversial proposals by order, and
consultees&#146; views will form part of the Minister&#146;s
assessment on matters of controversy. If, after the consultation, the
Minster decides to proceed with the making of the order, he will lay a
draft order before Parliament. The Minister must explain why he
considers that the constitutional precondition and the other
preconditions are satisfied in the explanatory document that must also
be laid before Parliament, under Clause 14(2). Parliament will then
consider the appropriateness of the order, taking into account whether
the preconditions are met and whatever other factors it considers
relevant. Parliament has the veto over orders, so ultimately it can
reject proposals that it finds inappropriate for delivery by
order.</p><p><a name="06102652000184"></a>I want to go over the
amendments in this group that we cannot support. In Committee, noble
Lords acknowledged the difficulties with a list of excluded enactments
or subject areas. We rejected this approach, which is set out in the
various amendments. At Second Reading, the noble
Lord, Lord Goodhart, acknowledged that it would be nigh impossible to 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1305"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>define a set of constitutional enactments&#151;if such a class of
legislation could be said to exist&#151;or constitutional areas.
Defining such a list is difficult. One must judge where it might begin
and end. Amendments Nos. 25 and 26, which are consequential on
Amendment No. 27, show the difficulties of this
approach.</p><p><a name="06102652000185"></a>The
list of excluded Acts in Amendment No. 27 is much shorter than those we
considered in Committee and differs from the list of statutes and areas
in Amendment No. 25. The difference between the lists shows the lack of
consensus on the issue. Amendment No. 27 creates a list of excluded
Acts regarding devolution. The Government are content that the new
precondition would prevent any constitutionally significant amendments
to the Scotland Act and the Government of Wales Acts, just as it would
prevent constitutionally significant amendments to any other
enactment.</p><p><a name="06102652000186"></a>We are therefore
content that orders could not be used to effect significant
constitutional changes to the UK&#146;s devolution settlements and
that Amendment No. 14 puts that beyond doubt. However, as I mentioned,
the new constitutional precondition would allow minor amendments which
are not of constitutional significance. The Government believe that we
should not prevent orders from delivering useful better regulatory
reforms which are not constitutionally significant to statutes, which
could include the Scotland Act and Wales Acts. Our Amendment No. 14 is
therefore better targeted than Amendments Nos. 25 and
27.</p><p><a name="06102652000187"></a>I do not understand why the
noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan, have singled out the
right to trial by jury in Amendment No. 16. Clause 3 already prevents
Ministers from making orders containing provisions which they consider
would remove necessary protections, or prevent a person from continuing
to exercise any right or freedom which they might reasonably expect to
retain. Therefore, the Government are already of the opinion that the
right to trial by jury is a necessary protection, and a right which
someone might reasonably expect to keep. I cannot see how an order
could be used to effect such change. I give the assurance that the
right to a jury trial is already protected in that sense.</p><p><a name="06102652000188"></a>As I have said before, defining the
parameters of an appropriate list of statutes or areas would be
cumbersome. It would amount to trying to write or codify the
constitution, which is what Amendment No. 15 of the noble, Lord Norton,
and Amendment No. 25 of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, attempt to do.
This is a significant project, as I am sure noble Lords would agree. If
we are to debate the parameters of the constitution, this Bill is not
the context in which we should do
so.</p><p><a name="06102652000189"></a>The House of Lords
Constitution Committee recognised the difficulties with devising a
schedule of exempted areas, and states that a schedule would be
something of a blunderbuss approach. It notes that not all provisions
in Acts with constitutional implications affect our constitutional
arrangements, and concludes that,</p><ul><a name="06102652000816"></a>&#147;it might be thought wrong to
exclude such provisions from the general operation of the
bill&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1306"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06102652000705"></a>This is precisely
the problem with Amendments Nos. 15, 25 and 27.
<p><a name="06102652000190"></a>The amendment tabled by
the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, sets out areas which he thinks
should fall within the scope of the &#147;constitutional
significance&#148; amendment. Not every proposal for change in these
areas will necessarily be of constitutional significance; they might be
exceedingly trivial. If they are significant, they will fall within the
scope of the precondition without further definition. Unless they deal
with issues which fall within the general purposes of the Bill, they
will be doubly <I>ultra vires</I>.</p><p><a name="06102652000191"></a>The amendment adds nothing to the
protection of rights and freedoms in the Bill, which, of course,
include the precondition concerning rights and freedoms. It is already
unlawful for a Minister to make an order that is incompatible with
convention rights under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act. Clause 9
also prevents amendments to the Human Rights Act itself. Adequate
safeguards concerning the Human Rights Act already exist, and so the
provision is, in this respect, otiose. Furthermore, the Government
consider that it would be foolish to put some Acts off limits when it
may be necessary to make minor or consequential changes to them for the
purposes of better regulation.</p><p><a name="06102652000192"></a>I note that the list in Amendment No. 15,
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, would rule out any reform of the
Executive, preventing useful better regulation reforms to government
departments which act as regulators. Clause 1(4) prevents orders from
inappropriately removing burdens which fall only on Ministers or
government departments. It provides that burdens falling only on
Ministers or departments can only be removed in so far as they are
burdens which affect the Minister or department in their exercise of a
regulatory function, as we discussed earlier.</p><p><a name="06102652000193"></a>Fears were expressed that the Bill would
somehow allow departments to cease providing public services. Clause
1(4) ensures that, for instance, it would not be possible to make an
order stopping the provision of a public service because it was
considered a cost and a burden. As Cabinet Ministers have argued on
many previous occasions, any substantial policy change to core public
services would be utterly unsuitable for delivery by order. However,
some amendments to enactments relating to the Executive could be
usefully delivered by order. The Government have a number of regulatory
functions such as the company law regulatory functions within the DTI
and the pesticides directorate, to which we have referred before. The
Government believe that orders should be able to remove or reduce
burdens from departments where they are carrying out regulatory
functions, in the same way as they can for
regulators.</p><p><a name="06102652000194"></a>Amendment
No. 15 would seem to permit major reforms to the Civil Service or local
authorities. Abolition of local authorities would fall foul of my
Amendment No. 14, but Amendment No. 15 seems to define constitutional
significance in a way which would no longer rule this out. This shows
the strength of the government amendment. The new
constitutional

significance&#151;which we all recognise when it arrives&#151;while
avoiding the difficulties of attempting a
definition.</p><p><a name="06102652000195"></a>Although the Bill
could not be used to make significant constitutional change, Amendment
No. 14 will put beyond any doubt that the order-making powers could not
be used to enact significant constitutional change. It also avoids the
difficulties with a list of constitutional enactments or subject areas,
which were highlighted by the Constitution Committee.</p><p><a name="06102652000196"></a>I have explained why the Government
believe that their approach is the most appropriate and wholly adequate
without further bolstering. I therefore commend Amendment No. 14 to the
House, and suggest that, on reflection, noble Lords do not move
Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 25, 26 and 27. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000197"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="06102652001381"></a>Lord

insert-</ul><ul><a name="06102652000744"></a>&#147;( ) For the
purposes of subsection (2)(f), a measure of constitutional significance
is one that affects the structures, powers and compositions of organs
of the state (the Crown, the executive, Parliament and the judiciary),
the relationship of those organs to one another, or the rights and
freedoms held by the individual at common law or under the provisions
of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c.
42).&#148;</ul><p><a name="06102652000198"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, the government amendment is welcome but runs
up against the obvious problem that the Minister has touched upon but
not really dealt with: what constitutes a measure of constitutional
significance? He says that we will all recognise it when it arrives. I
do not think that is the basis for
legislating.</p><p><a name="06102652000199"></a>We have come up
against this problem before, not least when debating the then Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, as the Minister will remember,
when there was an attempt to provide for referendums on issues of
constitutional significance. The problem was recognised in Committee,
prompting the Minister&#146;s amendment. If we are to have the
government amendment, however, we need to know precisely what it
encompasses.</p><p><a name="06102652000200"></a>The Government
have a problem defining what their amendment encompasses. When the then
Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg,
appeared before the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146;
House, he conceded that the Government did not have a definition of a
constitution, but also that the one offered by the committee was as
good as any. When his successor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Falconer&#151;Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs as well
as Lord Chancellor&#151;appeared before the committee, he, too,
reiterated that the Government did not have a definition of a
constitution. Under Amendment No. 14, Ministers are thus
precluded from using orders to amend measures of constitutional
significance, without any clear definition of what falls within the
scope of that term. One cannot rely on each Minister to determine what
it means, as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, seems to imply. Hardly any 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1308"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister has any grounding in the subject, and relying on consultations,
as the noble Lord suggests, will not advance us any further. What one
Minister deems to be of constitutional significance may not be so
construed by another.</p><h5><a name="06102652000850"></a>1
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000201"></a>The purpose of my amendment
to Amendment No. 14 is to provide a clear stipulation of what the term
&#147;constitutional significance&#148; encompasses. As the
Minister noted, I have adopted what I referred to in Committee as
&#147;the generic approach&#148;. As I argued then, it is not
incompatible with the approach of listing measures to be excluded
because they are deemed to be of constitutional importance. However,
given the Minister&#146;s amendment, I think the generic approach is
the appropriate one.</p><p><a name="06102652000202"></a>I concede that what I
propose is not a watertight definition, which is the point the Minister
developed. It is impossible to generate such a definition, but I think
that it is sufficient to demonstrate what should be out of bounds for
the order-making powers in the Bill, and that it is necessary in the
light of the government amendment. I am not sure that one can have
Amendment No. 14 without Amendment No. 15; it is a case of both or
neither.</p><p><a name="06102652000203"></a>The definition I have
employed is not watertight, but it is not too dissimilar to the one
that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, said was as good
as any he had seen. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, appeared
to misunderstand what was embodied in the definition; he then thought
it was confined to the relationship of the different organs of the
state to one another, which clearly it is not. It is a more
encompassing definition.</p><p><a name="06102652000204"></a>I hope that, on
reflection, the Minister will realise that this amendment is helpful to
Ministers. It helps to prevent them straying into territory that they
should avoid and thus reduces the chances of a challenge to the
decision. The noble Lord may argue&#151;as he did in Committee and
has already done today&#151;that Ministers will not stray into that
territory. However, the amendment he moved is designed to provide in
the Bill that that territory is out of bounds, and my amendment helps
to define the territory.</p><p><a name="06102652000205"></a>I can
see that the Minister has gone a considerable way to meet the concerns
expressed in Committee, and I am grateful to him for his letter on the
subject. His amendment is a necessary but insufficient condition if
provisions of constitutional significance are to be excluded from the
order-making powers of the Bill. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000206"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew73"></a><a name="06102652001382"></a>Lord

strongly as I would have welcomed my Amendment No. 13 being accepted.
This is the simplest and best solution to the problem debated in
Committee. It is certainly preferable to having a list of
constitutional statutes and, probably, to having a list

support Amendment No. 26 because a list of constitutional statutes
would need constant updating, and many statutes contain provisions that
are constitutionally important alongside those that are not.</p><p><a name="06102652000207"></a>Amendment No. 15, tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is considerably more valuable. I have some
difficulties with it and, if it is to go into the Bill, it would need
to be looked at more carefully. For example, the statutory powers of
the Executive would not be touchable, but some minor steps to extend
or, perhaps more importantly in this context, restrict powers would
plainly not be of constitutional significance. Indeed, one of the main
purposes of the Bill could be said to be to remove unnecessary powers
of the Executive. To that extent, the amendment arguably defeats part
of the purpose of the Bill. On the other hand, the definition does not
include the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly in the definition
of the organs of the state, but any move in Westminster to impose
restrictions on the powers of the devolved legislatures would, in the
present circumstances, plainly be a matter of constitutional
importance.</p><p><a name="06102652000208"></a>I tabled Amendment
No. 16 to fill a possible gap because I was not entirely satisfied that
the rights to a trial by jury were covered by the Bill. However, I
heard the Minister say that the Government&#146;s understanding is
that the existing conditions in Clause 3 would have that effect and
would prevent any step to remove an existing right to trial by jury. I
am happy to accept that statement and shall not press this
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000209"></a>Amendment No. 27
adds the devolution statutes relating to Scotland and Wales to a list
of statutes in Clause 8 that cannot be altered by order under the Bill.
I tabled this amendment to meet the concerns of some Members of the
Scottish Parliament. I understand that the Scottish Parliament was
assured that changes to the devolution settlement&#151;in particular,
any changes to the Scotland Act&#151;would be interpreted as being
provisions of constitutional significance. The Minister said that the
Bill would permit changes to the Scotland Act that are not of
constitutional significance. Having looked at the Scotland Act, I can
see that there are some changes that, on the face of it, could be
regarded as not being of constitutional significance. But there is
concern in Scotland that the Westminster Parliament should not be free
to use this special procedure to make any changes to the Scotland Act.
The Scotland Act is, in a sense, the possession of the Scottish
Parliament in the same way as it is clearly the possession of the
United Kingdom Parliament in which we sit. In those circumstances,
unless the Minister is prepared to give an assurance that the Scotland
Act will be untouchable under the Bill and that any changes to it will
be regarded as being of constitutional importance, I would need to take
further instructions from my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament to
see whether they are satisfied with that position. At present, I am not
satisfied with what the Minister has said on that
subject.</p>

Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart, has made an important point. Amendment No. 25, which was
tabled by my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who probably feels he need not
speak to it at this point, lists a number of Acts as a means of
defining that which is of constitutional importance. That would solve
the problem that the Members of the Scots Parliament see. They are
thinking rightly when they say that they do not want the Scotland Act
fiddled about with by regulatory reform orders at Westminster, although
the Scotland Act is, of course, Westminster legislation. It is
excellent that the Minister, having argued strongly in Committee
against doing anything about the issue, has now moved an amendment to
exclude matters of constitutional importance from Part 1. The
definition by list, which the Law Society of Scotland suggested
previously and is again suggesting, has weaknesses. It is difficult to
have an exclusive list. But, at the same time, it solves the problem
raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, so we have a
difficulty.</p><p><a name="06102652000211"></a>My noble friend
Lord Norton made a very powerful argument for clarifying what Amendment
No. 14 would do. I too wondered whether legislation passed by the Scots
Parliament and the Welsh Assembly would be included in the amendment.
Of course there is ancient legislation in Scotland, which may have to
be changed, and the question is how to do that when it concerns
devolved matters.</p><p><a name="06102652000212"></a>The
Government should look very carefully at what my noble friend Lord
Norton said. His wording may not be absolutely correct, but I suspect
that he has thought deeply about this subject, on which he knows a
great deal. The Minister should not brush it off lightly but see
whether he can return at Third Reading with something
similar.</p><p><a name="06102652000213"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew75"></a><a name="06102652001384"></a>Lord

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for
those words of support from the Front Benches opposite for the
Government&#146;s amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that
he strongly welcomed it, and the noble Lord, Lord Norton, from the Back
Benches and the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said that they welcomed
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000218"></a>We all recognise that the
debate has moved on. We listened very carefully to what was said at an
earlier stage in the Bill and have come up with this new precondition.
I am not attracted to the attempt by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton, to link Amendments Nos. 14 and 15. It is a seductive offer, but
one I shall have to decline. I cannot agree that the constitutional
precondition fails to offer real protection unless the Bill defines
constitutional significance. The other preconditions offer real
protections&#151;for example, they offer necessary protections
without defining what those necessary protections might be. That was
the approach adopted in the 2001 Act, and we think that it provides a
genuine protection.</p><p><a name="06102652000219"></a>The
approach of the noble Lord, Lord Norton, would cause some uncertainty
to enter into our intentions, because it is unclear to what extent the
piece of legislation would have to affect these areas to be prohibited
from reform by order. That could lead to the Part 1 power being
interpreted rather narrowly, and might limit its usefulness. In the
time we have been debating and considering the legislation, I have
sensed that that is not what Parliament wants. It is not the best way
to proceed if we are to use those powers in terms of creating the right
atmosphere for deregulation.</p><p><a name="06102652000220"></a>We
do not think that it would be appropriate for the Government to try to
pre-empt the views of not only Parliament but consultees in suggesting
a list of areas&#151;or statutes for that matter&#151;which
Ministers, consultees, Parliament and so on would find constitutionally
significant. We do not think that that approach recommends
itself.</p><p><a name="06102652000221"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised an issue about Scotland, which was
echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. We do not accept
that all changes to the Scotland Act would be of constitutional
significance. As she said, the Scotland Act is a Westminster Act. We
are content that the new precondition would prevent amendments to the
Scotland Act and the Government of Wales Act which were
constitutionally significant, just as it would prevent amendments which
were constitutionally significant to any other enactment. We are
content that orders could not be used to effect significant
constitutional changes to our devolutionary settlement. Our Amendment
No. 14 puts that beyond doubt.</p><h5><a name="06102652000851"></a>1.15

that he will accept that most of the things we propose to do by order

fundamentally breach the important principle. For that reason, I think
we are on safe territory, but I will reflect on the point noble Lords
make. Clearly, we do not wish to unsettle in any way the beauty of the
constitutional arrangement that currently exists, and I certainly would
not want to upset the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, on this
because she is very fierce on these subjects. We know that we have to
take very carefully into account any issues of constitutional
importance which are raised in
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06102652000224"></a><b><a name="61026-0002.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06102652001391"></a>Baroness

that he thinks he is on safe territory. My point is that the territory

Andrews:</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I
shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by the Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government on the future of local
government. The Statement is as
follows:</p>&#147;Local
authorities and the services they provide in partnership with others
are hugely important to the health and strength of our communities and
country. They help to determine the quality of our everyday
lives&#151;the schools our children attend, the cleanliness and
safety of our neighbourhoods, the health of families, the ease with
which we can travel, and the leisure activities we enjoy. Many of the
biggest social advances in recent generations were led by local
government and its leaders. They have served their communities well.
But, in 1997, this Government inherited public services and
institutions that were rundown, demoralised and starved of cash and
resources. We responded with significant investment to expand capacity,
and by setting a strong direction
nationally.&#147;Combined
with the hard work and commitment of local councillors, the local
government workforce and other partners, this has led to real
improvements in local public service delivery. For the next phase of
reform, we need to respond to new challenges. The increasing complexity
and diversity of these&#151;from climate change to tackling
deep-rooted social exclusion&#151;demand more flexibility at the
local level. Expectations of citizens are rising fast. They rightly
want more choice over the services they receive, more influence over
those who provide them and higher service
standards.&#147;The White
Paper that I am publishing today proposes that local authorities and
other public service providers have the freedom and powers they need to
meet the needs of their communities and to be more clearly accountable
for doing so. Communities must also have a bigger say in the issues
that matter to them most. We therefore propose a new settlement with
local government, communities and citizens. We will give local
authorities a stronger role in leading their communities and bringing
services together to address local needs and problems. Central
government will play their part in guaranteeing minimum standards and
setting overall national goals, but we will step back and allow more
freedom and flexibility at the local level. In exchange, we expect to
see more accountability to local citizens, stronger local leadership,
better and more efficient services and a readiness to support tougher
intervention when things go
wrong.&#147;The White Paper
sets out how we intend to achieve this rebalancing between central
government, local government and local people. At present, there are as
many as 1,200 national targets and indicators for a local area. In
future, we will cut this to 200 indicators, with around 35 targets,
plus statutory education and childcare targets. The 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1314"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>targets will be tailored to local needs, agreed between government and
local partners and set out in the local area agreement. In this way, we
will focus on the things that really matter to people everywhere,
guaranteeing national minimum standards but encouraging local
innovation and local priorities. We will introduce a more
proportionate, risk-based inspection regime to cut bureaucracy, and
more targeted support or intervention when things go
wrong.&#147;Our best local
authority leaders have made a huge difference to the citizens and
communities they serve. The White Paper sets out measures to ensure
that all communities benefit from strong, accountable and visible
leadership. In future, there will be three choices for councils: a
directly elected mayor, a directly elected executive of councillors, or
a leader elected by their fellow councillors with a clear four-year
mandate. All the executive powers of local authorities will be vested
in the leader of the council, with a strong role for the council to
scrutinise the leader&#146;s actions and approve the budget and major
plans.&#147;The way in
which councils choose to govern themselves will be different in
different parts of the country. We will make it easier for local
authorities to move to a directly elected mayor or executive by
resolution of the council, in consultation with local people. Where
they want to, they will also be able to introduce whole-council
elections and single-member wards, improving accountability to
voters.&#147;We recognise
the potential gains that unitary status can offer in terms of
accountable, strategic leadership and improved efficiency. There will
be a short window of opportunity for councils in &#145;shire&#146;
areas to seek unitary status. We expect a small number of proposals to
meet the value for money criterion and the other criteria set out in
the invitation we have issued today. In remaining two-tier areas, we
will work with local authorities to deliver better value for money and
greater
efficiency.&#147;Strong
leadership works best if balanced by citizens and communities having a
bigger say in the quality of the services they receive and the places
where they live. To ensure services are more accountable, more
responsive and more efficient, local authorities will involve and
consult service users more fully and provide better information about
standards in their local area. In addition, we will review barriers and
incentives to increased community ownership and management of local
facilities and other assets. We will increase and strengthen the powers
of local people to demand answers and action through a new community
call for
action.&#147;Councillors
should be champions for their local community, able to speak out on all
issues affecting their local area, including planning and licensing.
They should be able to sort out issues on the ground or demand a formal
response through scrutiny procedures. Effective scrutiny by councillors
is an essential part of robust local democracy. We will strengthen it.
Communities 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1315"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need strategic leadership to help to bring local partners, the business
sector and the voluntary and community sectors together. Issues such as
community safety, public health or community cohesion require all local
partners to share the same agenda. Our best local authorities already
recognise this, and their citizens and communities benefit as a result.
Our proposals will ensure that this happens across the
country.&#147;Sir Michael
Lyons described the &#145;place-shaping&#146; role of local
authorities in his report this May. I pay tribute to his work so far.
The proposals before the House today provide a clear basis
for Sir Michael&#146;s future conclusions on local
government funding. Cities play an increasingly important role as
engines of economic growth. In recent years, there has been a
renaissance in our towns and cities, thanks to the vision and
leadership of local authorities and their partners. But we need to go
further. We must look beyond city and town boundaries to consider the
success and prosperity of the surrounding area. In recent months, we
have consulted our towns and cities on the tools and powers they need
for economic development. There is no &#145;one size fits
all&#146;.&#147;The White
Paper provides a response to issues raised by towns and cities on
transport, skills, economic development and co-operation between
neighbouring local authorities. We will continue to work with them over
the coming months. Our clear, overriding principle is that the greater
the powers devolved, the greater the premium on clear, visible
leadership. None of our reforms can be carried out without a strong and
committed workforce. Local government contains many high-quality
councillors and public servants. It has transformed our towns and
cities, and in many areas it is leading public services in partnership
working, innovation and efficiency. Our reforms will give citizens and
communities a clearer voice, create stronger and more visible
leadership, and establish a new settlement with local government and
its partners, communities and citizens.
&#147;The White Paper is about
creating better services and better places. It sets out the tools that
will help all local areas to tackle the challenges of the 21st century,
to capture the strength and talents of their citizens and communities
and to achieve their full potential. I commend this White Paper to the
House&#148;.<p><a name="06102652000232"></a>My Lords, that
concludes the Statement.</p><h5><a name="06102652000853"></a>1.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000233"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew86"></a><a name="06102652001395"></a>Baroness
Hanham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement made by the Secretary of State in the other
place a short time ago. I declare that I am an elected member of a
local council. In doing that, I join the Minister in acknowledging the
enormous amount of work&#151;I probably take myself out of this
comment&#151;that local councillors do and their commitment to their
communities. As with all Statements, there is only a limited amount
that one can say in response, partly because the White Paper 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1316"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on which it is based is not released until after the Statement has been
made. We are left with just the pr&#233;cis in the Statement, which
arrived rather late on our desks, of what is
involved.</p><p><a name="06102652000234"></a>The first aspect that
I would like to test with the Minister is the relationship that the
White Paper will have with legislation in the next Session. Will that
be with or without the influence of the Lyons report? That is where the
meat of change will lie. Fiddling around with the organisation of a
local government&#146;s internal arrangements is a minor part of the
changes that the Government will presumably have to make. Is it
intended that any legislation emanating from this White Paper will
encompass the Lyons recommendations? How can anything relevant to local
government be decided in the absence of consideration of its financing?
Has Lyons effectively been kicked into touch at this time? As we have
always expected, the solutions to the questions raised are likely to be
far more radical than perhaps the Government wish to contemplate. Will
the legislation include any provisions that are required to implement
the changes to the Mayor for London&#146;s
powers?</p><p><a name="06102652000235"></a>It is hard to give a
very warm welcome to what has come forward today. All parties subscribe
to the theory of localism, but each seems to have a slightly different
view of what that means. There may be aspects in this White
Paper&#151;when I have a chance to read it&#151;on which we will
agree with the Government and which we think are worth having. But
devolving powers to the lowest level of democratic government from
central government and returning the powers that have been given to the
undemocratic regions does not seem to be part of what is on offer here.
What devolvement of powers does the Minister believe will come from
these proposals, particularly in relation to transport, planning and
economic development? At the moment, it seems&#151;this is very
cursory&#151;as if devolvement is restricted to enabling a few parish
councils to make a few more by-laws.</p><p><a name="06102652000236"></a>What has happened to the good intentions
from the statements made in the past by the Prime Minister, by the
Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and by the Secretary of State, Ruth Kelly, on
devolution? Have they got lost in and during the interregnum of the
transfer of power at the highest levels in government? What is
happening with the Barker report? Will any of her recommendations that
need to come forward in legislation be included in the next
Session?</p><p><a name="06102652000237"></a>As I have said, I have
not seen the full proposals so it is hard to know quite what the fine
words mean or what relevance they have to the electorate in general.
The main thrust seems to be that the Government are trying to devise a
new settlement with local government, communities and citizens, which
is how it is put. The only welcome proposals to aid that are a promise
by the Government to reduce 1,200 targets down to 200 indicators and 35
targets. What of scrutiny by external inspectors? Where will they play
a role in this, or are they to be abolished? What penalties will there
be for not achieving these targets? Perhaps the Minister will be able
to give us information on that.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000238"></a>We would all welcome
more support for the democratic leadership of councils. But does the
White Paper give any more detail on what would be involved in, for
example, a directly elected executive of councillors? Would a leader
have to be previously selected or elected by colleagues and then go to
the electorate with a full slate of executive members? How would they
be selected? How would they be put forward for election? Would they
have to be elected as councillors first? If not, how would they be
chosen? I hope that there is more clarity than is currently
available.</p><p><a name="06102652000239"></a>Can the Minister give
us some idea of how it is envisaged that the role of back-bench
councillors&#151;those who actually represent their
communities&#151;will be strengthened? How will they be engaged in
the business of the council, or will they remain as they
are&#151;largely outside the administration of and decision-making on
policy and practice? I am delighted to know that the White Paper gives
councillors their voice back on planning and licensing issues. That
disgraceful lapse was brought about by this Government. We had long
arguments during the debates on the Licensing Bill when we put forward
the view that the councillors&#146; democratic voice would be taken
out, but we were completely pooh-poohed. The same thing has happened
with planning. I am delighted that at last the Government have realised
that this is a role for councillors. It is a disgrace that councillors
have not been allowed to speak and that, when they have spoken, they
have been threatened with the Standards Board. I very much hope that
the White Paper makes it clear that their role is at the centre of
these issues and that they are not to be precluded from them. Also, how
will the proposals for the community call for action work?</p><p><a name="06102652000240"></a>The White Paper looks as if it might be a
missed opportunity to truly strengthen local government&#151;that
will become more apparent as time goes on&#151;to devolve power
properly to the local level and to rid us of the regional level, which
was dreamt up by the Deputy Prime Minister and resoundingly defeated by
the electorate. It is good that councillors should be able to decide
when their elections should be and whether they should be annual or by
thirds. It is time for that to be amended and I suspect that many
councillors will want to go for the full four-year term.
</p><p><a name="06102652000241"></a>What are the
electorate to make of all this? They are reeling from extraordinary
hikes in council tax, which, in the past five or six years, has risen
astronomically&#151;all under this Government. The electorate are
scared stiff of the revaluation of their properties for local tax
purposes. They are now threatened with the Northern Ireland regime,
which I hope will not come here, and the arrival of council tax
inspectors marching all over their houses to check the amount of double
glazing and the views from the windows. They are unable to find their
way through the unfathomable processes that will keep elderly people in
care without bankrupting them. It does not look as though this White
Paper will help with that at
all.</p><p><a name="06102652000242"></a>I hope that the process
that will follow this Statement&#151;that of legislation&#151;will
enable us to delve into some of these matters and to end up with
proposals and powers that are really relevant to local 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1318"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>communities and on which we can ultimately agree. That is what local
government is about; it is about representation of its people. The more
agreement that we can come to politically, the better that role can be
fulfilled. I do not promise that it will be like that. I expect that
there is more than meets the eye in this legislation. But, in the mean
time, the curate&#146;s egg is well and truly
laid.</p><h5><a name="06102652000854"></a>1.38

Scott of Needham Market:</b> My Lords, we live in one
of the most centralised states in western Europe and, after the effects
of this White Paper have been felt, that will remain the case. This is
a wasted opportunity. The White Paper has not been worth the wait of
the many months that it has taken to get this far. It does nothing to
address the increasingly unsustainable burden of council tax or to deal
with the dominance of central government funding for local government
services. That lack of local financial flexibility is at the core of
the weakness of modern local government. The White Paper does nothing
to return the powers of central government or quangos back to town
halls.</p><p><a name="06102652000244"></a>The document is full of
motherhood and apple pie, or as I have been taught to say in this new
era of equalities, &#147;non gender-specific parenthood&#148;. The
Government now claim that they have discovered localism and
decentralisation. Of course we welcome their conversion to the idea,
but we remain deeply sceptical about whether they have any real
understanding of it. The implementation is via a zoo of acronyms and
action plans, all of which have the capacity to blur genuine
accountability.</p><p><a name="06102652000245"></a>The Government
remain besotted with the notion of mayors. So far there have been 34
local referendums resulting in 22 rejections and 12 wins. That has been
the choice of local communities. But Mr Blair wants mayors and so Mr
Blair shall get mayors. We are going to get them through consultation
now, not through referendums. If you do not want a mayor, you can have
an enhanced leader. This is the imposition of the mayoral system by the
back door, and I ask the noble Baroness why the Government are so
determined to emasculate back-bench councillors in the same way as they
have emasculated Back-Bench MPs. Vesting all executive power in an
authority in one person is a highly dangerous move and should be
resisted at all costs.</p><p><a name="06102652000246"></a>There is
a proposal to allow some areas that have already expressed an interest
to become unitary councils if they choose to do so, and we believe that
this is a sensible way forward. But we would like to know what the
triggers are for this and how consent will be determined. Who will have
a vote in such a proposal and who will make the final
decision?</p><p><a name="06102652000247"></a>The
exact proposals for parishes are unclear, but giving very local
communities more say in service delivery and local well-being is of
course to be welcomed, provided that democratic accountability is not
lost. A right to initiate a call to action must not turn into mob rule,
and principal councils must retain the capacity to take strategic
decisions and deliver big services for the benefit of the whole
community. If it is left to the 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1319"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>weight of numbers, the fix-the-pothole lobby will always be larger than
the special-educational-needs lobby, but that does not make it
right.</p><p><a name="06102652000248"></a>In passing, I should like
to comment on the flow chart on page 37, which describes what will
happen in a call to action. It has come straight from the Janet and
John book of local government. For anyone who has spent time in local
government, it is
risible.</p><p><a name="06102652000249"></a>City
regions are a case of the dog that has not barked in the night. We
heard a lot about the idea in the Miliband era, but sadly it now seems
to be rather silent. Several metropolitan areas are now ready for
co-operative working, which they see as a way of unlocking devolved
powers from Whitehall. So the crucial issues are the governance
proposals that will be linked to the scheme: are they to have mayors;
are councils to merge; and are we to have federated structures? More
important, what powers would be on offer to those who choose to go down
this route? If the scheme is linked to travel-to-work areas, existing
council boundaries will be crossed and therefore local consent
mechanisms are very important. Strengthening passenger transport
authorities is to be welcomed in
principle.</p><p><a name="06102652000250"></a>Members on these
Benches regret that this White Paper has been published ahead of the
Lyons review so that the issues of powers, finance and structures will
not be considered together despite the fact that they are inextricably
linked. We believe that the failure to link these important issues will
probably ensure that, even by its own meagre objectives, this White
Paper is doomed to
fail.</p><h5><a name="06102652000855"></a>1.43

Andrews:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for the welcome
given to the White Paper. I have sympathy with the pressures on
Opposition Front Bench spokesmen who have to respond to a very detailed
White Paper at short notice. I fully intend to make myself and
officials widely available over the coming days and months so that we
can sit down and discuss the detail as fully as possible because there
is a great deal to consider and on which to take collective advice from
the wisdom available around this Chamber. I am particularly pleased to
see the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, in his place because I would
like to say how much we have appreciated working with the Local
Government Association. In response to the cynical voices on the
Opposition Benches, I should point out that we have received a great
deal of support from the LGA for what we have brought forward because
it is very much in tune with what the association has been telling us
would be right and proper for local authorities. The noble Lord, Lord
Bruce-Lockhart, himself said this morning that these are significant
changes.</p><p><a name="06102652000252"></a>In
the time I have available, I shall address the major issues. There is
no way that we would agree that this is a missed opportunity. This is a
consensual paper and I look forward very much to it growing more
consensual over the coming months as we bring forward legislation
because nothing is more important than that we work together in local
government to make the best possible offer to citizens. The White Paper
has 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1320"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>preceded the Lyons report because we were right to say that deliberation
on form and function comes first. In his interim report, Sir Michael
Lyons influenced our thinking in the emphasis he placed on the shaping
of powers and what that would involve, as well as on new ways of
working. In turn, we will read and consider extremely carefully what he
brings forward. He now has a full explanation of what we think local
government can and should do in the future. This is a seamless process.
When the local government Bill is brought forward it will give
consideration to the things which need legislation as set out in the
White Paper, and I will share those with the House as soon as possible.
Obviously we have to give a lot of consideration to what Sir Michael
Lyons says and therefore the form of the Bill is not yet resolved on
issues of that sort. But in no way has it been kicked into touch; far
from it. With regard to the impact that this Bill may have on a GLA
Bill and the powers of the Mayor of London, there will be no
impact.</p><p><a name="06102652000253"></a>The noble Baroness
asked a number of questions about the sequence in which these things
will be dealt with. I have spoken about Lyons, but Barker is of course
another example. We will listen hard to what Kate Barker has to say
about the ways in which we can improve the planning system, building on
what we have done already and addressing the culture of change in
planning so as to bring land allocation, land use, housing, employment
and productivity closer together&#151;closer to the ground&#151;and
make it more effective.</p><p><a name="06102652000254"></a>On the
devolutionary powers in the Bill, when noble Lords read the White Paper
they will see the scope of the devolution. Let me take, for example,
the way the powers of the Secretary of State have been reduced. The
Secretary of State will no longer be able to determine whether parishes
are created; that will go to the district councils. Equally, government
will no longer account for whole elections; that will now rest with a
resolution of the council. The Secretary of State will not have any
power to confirm by-laws. Devolution goes along with the emphasis we
give in the first chapter of the White Paper to the voice of the local
community and how to amplify it. We emphasise putting best value on the
ability of the council to inform, involve and consult so that local
people can test councils against best value and ensure that they have
achieved it&#151;as indeed many councils do to the best of their
ability.</p><p><a name="06102652000255"></a>I
turn to city powers. This is a work in progress and I hope noble Lords
will agree that it is a sensible approach when we are talking about
something as radical as looking at ways of giving more powers to cities
to enable them to become more efficient&#151;powers which they have
told us they want in the enormous consultations we have held not only
with cities but with towns around the country as well. Over the next
few months we will be looking at the joint review of economic
development when considering how to develop city plans. The Department
for Transport, for example, is looking to devolve more transport
powers, and we will come forward with more worked-out plans when we
have had an opportunity to consider the Leach review, the Barker review
and the Treasury report on sub-regional economies.</p>

regime, I am glad that the noble Baroness opposite recognises what a
radical step it is to strip out the 1,200 targets and reduce them to
200. They were set alongside the agreement on national outcomes, which
will itself determine what all local authorities will work towards: the
very top, high-level national priorities which will be determined in
the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review. These are to be 200 indicators
which will be agreed between local authorities and central government.
But more important again, 35 local targets&#151;different ones for
each local region to address particular problems such as economic
development or the delivery of public health systems&#151;will be set
to reflect local needs. That in turn will be reflected in the local
area agreement&#151;the delivery plan&#151;which, for the first
time, will be on a statutory footing. This will be underpinned by
duties which will attach to the local strategic partnership, with
partners not only in local authorities but in the whole range of public
services. There is a list of those named partners. There will be more
power to front-line councils, which is extremely important.</p><p><a name="06102652000257"></a>As to the processes for the direct
election of leaders&#151;one of the three options&#151;I should say
to the noble Baroness that we are not going to impose mayors. This is
not mayors by the back door but an open and very transparent process
which will depend a great deal on what the local authority itself wants
to do. As to the powers of local councils, the review will look not
only at the local call for action but also at training and a stronger
role for them. I am glad that there is a welcome for the reformed code
of conduct. I shall explain in writing how the community call for
action will work. I disagree with the noble Baroness&#151;I think it
is a very clear diagram. Would that all my papers had such clear
diagrams.</p><p><a name="06102652000258"></a>Let me address the
issue of unitary status and how it will be managed. We have made it
clear that this is an invitation to shire counties which they can
trigger and determine themselves. The criteria are set out. We have
said quite clearly that we will look at the broad consensus&#151;at
what determines it and who supports it. No district council or even
groups of councils will have a veto on it. I am very glad that the
noble Baroness welcomes the additional powers for parishes and the
right that districts will have to create
parishes.</p><p><a name="06102652000259"></a>I am grateful for the
welcome. I look forward to working with the Opposition when we

confidence&#151;and it is on structures that I wish to
comment.</p><p><a name="06102652000262"></a>First, I shall make a
couple of points on internal structures. I very much welcome the more
permissive and pluralist tone of the White Paper. Like previous
speakers, I, too, raise an eyebrow at elected mayors. There is nothing
one could not do as a majority leader than one could in addition have
done as mayor, except require the majority leader to
persuade&#151;and rightly so.</p><p><a name="06102652000263"></a>I also favour annual
elections rather than all out because I believe in incremental change
rather than swings-of-the-pendulum change. But, again, I welcome the
fact that this is a matter for local authority decision making and I
welcome very much the tone of my noble friend&#146;s White Paper
today. I still slightly regret the imposition of Westminster style
cabinet government on local government committee structures rather than
the introduction into Westminster of more effective committee styles
because I wanted all of our community to own change and not just the
cabinet of the majority
party.</p><p><a name="06102652000264"></a>Although
much less apparent in this White Paper&#151;again I am sure this is
to do with the influence of my noble friend&#151;there is still, none
the less, the belief that politics has to be conducted in a very macho,
male, adversarial style, that it is about conflict, leadership and
cabinets, whereas many of us would prefer to talk about consensus,
incremental change and committees. I do not think the change of
language is necessarily wise. I also suspect that single-member
wards&#151;although, again, this is rightly a matter for local
authorities&#151;will probably see a reduction in the number of women
counsellors, currently standing at 30 per cent. I would regret that.
But, as I say, the White Paper is about a more pluralistic and
consensual tone and it is to be
welcomed.</p><p><a name="06102652000265"></a>I also welcome the
greater permissiveness and pluralism in terms of external structures. I
do not think it is any secret that my own local authority, Norwich City
Council, hopes very much to become a unitary authority. It was, for 600
years, a county borough until 1974 and would very much like to have the
capacity to become, yet again, a unitary and competent authority. Why?
Because of the three problems that most face authorities such as my
own&#151;the problems of economic regeneration, anti-social behaviour
and so-called problem families, and increased longevity and its effect
on social care. These problems cut across the current district and
shire council&#151;and very often the health service
authority&#151;divides. I want to see local authorities with the
competence, in a holistic way, to deal with those
issues.</p><p><a name="06102652000266"></a>At the moment in my
city, four different local authorities end up providing different bits
of local authority services. How on earth does the local citizen voter
and taxpayer know who does what, to what standard, at what cost and
with what accountability? If they do not know and they cannot hold
someone accountable, why should they bother to vote? If they do not
bother to vote, we see the end of local
government.</p>

listen carefully to what she has to say over the next few
months.</p><p><a name="06102652000268"></a>We have addressed in the
White Paper some of my noble friend&#146;s anxieties about the
cabinet system, not least through the strengthening of the overview and
scrutiny committees which, for the first time, will have the
powers&#151;rather like a Select Committee&#151;to call for papers
and for people to appear before it. These could include the local PCT
or a whole range of named partners. It will be a much wider range
across local government. The other change will be that they will have a
right to expect&#151;and will have to expect&#151;a response to
their recommendations. It will not be sufficient for them simply to
appear and then nothing happens. So that and the review we will conduct
into the capacity of councillors to respond, as part of the democratic
renewal, to the call for action&#151;a combination of these plus
other things which are in the White Paper&#151;will address some of
my noble friend&#146;s anxieties that there is not a progressive
structure for local councils to move through in order to, as it were,
&#147;train up&#148; for local
government.</p><p><a name="06102652000269"></a>My noble
friend&#146;s point about local government structures is a graphic
example of why unitary authorities will bring together disparate
functions and end wastefulness. We have said that the invitation to
take part in restructuring is a short window, but there is no option
for no change in areas where there are still two-tier authorities; they
will all be required to improve their working practices. They will be
invited also to take part in pathfinder projects where they will be
able to test-out new ways of working. I look forward to seeing some of
the positive innovation that is already going on made more universal in
that
way.</p><p><a name="06102652000270"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew91"></a><a name="06102652001400"></a>Lord

which the Minister has kindly repeated are &#147;strong direction
nationally&#148;. There are many words suggesting this is about
devolution and decentralisation but I think that most of the
proposals&#151;although there are some useful relatively minor
things&#151;are about greater central direction; they are
authoritarian, centralist and will lead to greater
uniformity.</p><p><a name="06102652000271"></a>I am a member of a
borough council in Lancashire. What got me laughing about the chart on
page 37 is that it sets out what any good councillor has been doing
almost every day of their life for the entire time they have been on a
council&#151;in my case for much of the past 35 years&#151;and I am
not quite clear why it needs legislation to tell councillors how to
take up issues on behalf of their
residents.</p><p><a name="06102652000272"></a>I
shall focus on the emphasis in the White Paper on local area agreements
which, from the perspective of a district councillor in the very large
county of Lancashire, are neither local nor agreements; they are, very
substantially, imposed from the centre. The negotiations to which the
Secretary of State referred earlier in the House of Commons are very
one sided. They are conducted on the basis of, &#147;Do this; do it
this way and you will get the money. Don&#146;t do this; don&#146;t
do it this way and you won&#146;t get the money&#148;. A very large

matters such as housing, leisure and so on in local area agreements,
you end up with a uniform policy&#151;a one size fits all&#151;for
a hugely diverse county, from the Fylde coast, to north Lancashire, to
central Lancashire and Preston, to the east Lancashire towns and all
the rural areas. There are many such counties where local area
agreements are a means by which central government impose their
policies, their targets and their wishes on local people.</p><p><a name="06102652000273"></a>I do not see much in the White Paper
about the right to be different&#151;not the right to be different
because needs are different but because different places have similar
problems, different solutions are surely relevant. If local people
democratically want different solutions, surely that is what local
democracy is about. Does the Minister agree that what is in the White
Paper militates against that kind of local democratic
diversity?</p><p><a name="06102652000274"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06102652001401"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> No, my Lords, I do not agree at all. If
the noble Lord reads the introduction to the White Paper and the
prefaces of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, he will find
the right to be different written through it in the most powerful and
compelling way. I hope this is not a case of the Liberals believing
that we have taken over part of their agenda and feeling sore about it.
This is a serious attempt to make local area agreements work better.
The noble Lord is right that they have not been working as well as they
might, partly because they were imposed on top of a lot of other forms
and functions. We have responded again to the Local Government
Association; it has told us that this is one way to liberate the
potential for every local area to live up to what its community
wants.</p><p><a name="06102652000275"></a>The local area agreement
will be a statutory document, but it will be agreed locally. It will be
underpinned by the local strategic partnership, which, for the first
time, will have duties attached to work with its partners across local
government. It is significant that every Whitehall department has
signed up to this White Paper, and that is reflected on the ground.
This is a radical departure from how things have been done. There will
be more pots of money in the local area agreements and more policies to
be agreed.</p><p><a name="06102652000276"></a>The delivery of
social care involves so many different agencies, not least the
voluntary and community sector, but we will have a platform and a power
to bring these people together. It will be done under the agreed
outcomes at national level. We have to have those&#151;they are our
national priorities, whether it is higher achievement for young people
or better public health. Every local area will have 35 targets which it
negotiates itself. That is what will make the difference in the
character of the policy and delivery, which will make the difference
for local people. The voice of local people will be heard in a way it
has not been heard
before.</p><p><a name="06102652000277"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew93"></a><a name="06102652001402"></a>Lord

devolve more decision-taking powers to local government and to offer
more flexibility, freedom and local choice. It has hitherto been a
curiosity, and a rather unsatisfactory one, that the
Government&#146;s enthusiasm for devolution to the regions has not
apparently been matched by much enthusiasm for devolution to local
government. I very much welcome the radical approach that my noble
friend has described.</p><p><a name="06102652000278"></a>However,
that still leaves the looming question: how are the RDAs and other
regional satrapies to be made more democratically accountable? Can my
noble friend cast any light on that? Can she say how the
Government&#146;s policies in that regard would relate to their
encouragement to authorities to put themselves forward for unitary
status, which is extremely welcome? It must be right that our important
historic cities and boroughs should be able to be self-governing and
take responsibility for the delivery of the full range of local
services.</p><p><a name="06102652000279"></a>If we are to
strengthen our democracy as a whole, which we surely need to do, must
we not nurture democracy at local level? If enough people of real
ability and ambition for their communities are to be attracted into
local government and&#151;who knows&#151;thence into national
politics, is it not necessary to provide scope for them to exercise
responsibility commensurate with ability and ambition? Does that not
apply to all elected members, not just the leaders of local
authorities? Is not this fundamental issue more important than those
about particular forms of local government, whether elected mayors,
executive cabinets or local authority leaders on long leases?</p><p><a name="06102652000280"></a>Can my noble friend tell us whether the
very welcome reduction in targets that she has announced means that the
Treasury really means to let go, to allow elected local authorities to
raise and spend money, free from the stultifying oversight of central
government, instead being accountable to local people as citizens and
electors and, indeed, possibly to local calls to action? Has the
Treasury finally rid itself of the paranoia which possibly had some
justification in the 1970s but has been absurd in an age of global
financial markets&#151;its fear that an increase in local government
borrowing over and beyond what the Treasury decreed as appropriate
would cause a rise in interest rates and crowd out private investments?
Are we now to allow grown-ups in local authorities, as in private life,
to judge what they can afford to
borrow?</p><p><a name="06102652000281"></a>The phrase
&#147;earned autonomy&#148;, which I was glad not to hear from the
lips of my noble friend&#151;I think I did not&#151;has expressed
too much a post-war view, of which we have learnt to be thoroughly
sceptical, that the gentleman in Whitehall really does know best. Can
my noble friend assure us that we have now moved beyond that
patronising view towards a real respect for local people and local
democracy?</p><p><a name="06102652000282"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew94"></a><a name="06102652001403"></a>Baroness

whatever Sir Michael comes forward
with.</p><p><a name="06102652000284"></a>I very
much welcome what my noble friend said about the power and scope of
local councils and how we intend to build those up. We have to
revitalise our democracy. The starting point is to make local
councillors feel that there is nothing more honourable or effective
than representing their wards and councils. The White Paper will have
to do that in a big way.</p><p><a name="06102652000285"></a>On the
RDAs, we will come forward with worked-out plans for the cities and the
city regions. When the previous Secretary of State went around the
country, as the present one has, talking to cities and councils, it was
about the city and its region and the way in which economic development
spills over well beyond the city&#146;s boundaries. The strength of
cities and rural areas show that in addition to the cities&#146;
capacity to grow and be creative and competitive, like our European
competitors, the rural areas can benefit in their own special
way.</p><p><a name="06102652000286"></a>High-level authorities such
as oversight and scrutiny committees will be able to call on the RDAs
to explain themselves if they so choose, making them more accountable.
They are one of the named partners. There is a clear relationship here;
we do not intend to diminish the power or capacity of the RDAs. We
expect them to work closely and in harmony with cities and city regions
when we come forward with those
proposals.</p><p><a name="06102652000287"></a><b><a name="61026-0003.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06102652001404"></a>Baroness

presidential style&#151;the Government have that imposing strong
leadership models will commend itself to communities, given the very
lukewarm response to the proposition put before us, as my noble friend
said? Secondly, when will we get legislation dealing with the standards
board and codes of conduct? This issue, quite apart from all the others
raised, deserves to have a Bill taken through quickly. If Back-Benchers
are to be champions of their communities&#151;it is a <I>sine qua
non</I> for every councillor to be a champion of his or her
community&#151;they must be able to be involved in planning and
licensing matters in a way which is impossible now. In the days when I
chaired a London borough planning committee, I do not know how I could
have done the job subject to the restrictions which colleagues now
face. Will the cost and grief to taxpayers which the standards board is
causing come to an end quickly?</p>

confusion which people feel about who is responsible for what. It is
extremely difficult to find out what the council does, let alone what
the divisions of responsibilities within the councils really mean. I
have before me a customer survey on perceptions of local government in
England, which shows, for example, that 70 per cent people do not
believe that they can influence local decision-making, and that there
is a great deal of genuine confusion about everything that local
government does and who does it. I would be very happy to send that to
the noble Baroness. Paragraph 3.16 of the White Paper refers to another
survey which states that the role of the leader was perceived to have
become stronger where there was an elected mayor. It showed too that,

there was no obligation for the Government to introduce the regulation.
EC Directive 2001/83 left it explicitly to nation states to decide how
to regulate homeopathy, provided they meet the basic safety
requirements of manufactured products. This regulation was made by the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#151;the
MHRA&#151;explicitly for the benefit of the manufacturers of
homeopathic products. As the Explanatory Memorandum explains, the law
as it stood formerly did not allow new homeopathic products to make
claims for therapeutic benefits on their labels and failure to change
the law would, in the words of the MHRA,</p><ul><a name="06102652000817"></a>&#147;inhibit the expansion of the
homeopathic industry&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000706"></a>There was nothing to stop products
being sold under what is known as the &#147;simplified scheme&#148;
introduced in 1992, but a claim for efficacy could not then be made
which was not scientifically
tested.<p><a name="06102652000296"></a>The new regulation, by
the way, is concerned solely with homeopathy, not with alternative
medicines in general. It has nothing to do with other so-called
complementary medicines such as herbal medicines and acupuncture. I
mention that because there has been some confusion about it.</p><p><a name="06102652000297"></a>There is one very important, absolutely
fundamental objection to this regulation. For the first time in the
history of the regulation of medical products, it allows claims of
efficacy to be made without scientific evidence. It is an abandonment
of science and the evidence-based approach. Under this new regulation,
the sole basis on which claims of efficacy can be made for homeopathic
products quite legally is &#147;homeopathic provings&#148;. There
is no need for clinical or scientific tests.</p><p><a name="06102652000298"></a>Homeopathy is not based on science and is
not a science in any sense whatever. It is a system originally based on
two laws proclaimed by the German physician Hahnemann in 1796. The
first was that &#147;like cures like&#148;. For this there is no
evidence, any more than there is for the medical practice common at the
time of suppressing symptoms by the treatment of opposites. However, as
treating &#147;like with like&#148; could mean administering a
poison, which is not exactly beneficial, he added a second law: the
&#147;law of infinitesimals&#148;, which states that the more a
substance is diluted, the greater the benefit. Most homeopathic
medicines are just about infinitely diluted in water, commonly by 10 to
the power of 30&#151;that is, one followed by 30 noughts. What
remains is one part in 1 million million million million
million. Nothing of the original substance remains.</p><p><a name="06102652000299"></a>Not surprisingly, when
homeopathic substances have been tested scientifically by double-blind
experiments, no evidence has been found that they work any more than as
a placebo. This was recently confirmed by a review in the <I>Lancet</I>
of more than 100 different studies, which found that there was
insufficient evidence that homeopathy is efficacious for any single
clinical condition. The mechanism just cannot work. If it does work, it
can only be by magic or miracle.</p><p><a name="06102652000300"></a>Of course, a placebo can be helpful,
because when people believe that something works, it often
does&#151;or they get better anyway&#151;but it is the equivalent
of witchcraft. Placebos work in odd ways,

pills work better than red ones, except in the case of Italian men.
However, dependence on the equivalent of coloured water can be harmful
if people who are seriously ill believe in it strongly enough to avoid
taking orthodox medicine. Some sellers of homeopathic products also
make claims that, if acted on, could lead to serious consequences.
Recently, Sense About Science exposed the fact that homeopathic
remedies were being recommended against malaria&#151;a very dangerous
recommendation
indeed.</p><p><a name="06102652000301"></a>Evidence-based medicine
has brought huge benefits to mankind. It is disgraceful that this
regulation rejects the evidence-based approach. It undermines the value
of a licensing regime. There is still much public concern about
tragedies such as thalidomide, and we have gradually improved the
regulation of medicines based on scientific evidence. The Medicines Act
1968 was part of this progress. There have been further improvements
since. That is what we have come to expect. Now we get this regulation.
It is not surprising that it has come as a shock to the medical and
scientific world.</p><p><a name="06102652000302"></a>Those who
support evidence-based medicine in the strongest possible terms know
that what is at issue here is the relationship of trust between the
public and drug regulation. At Sense About Science, we have been
inundated with expressions of concern. These include comments from the
Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research
Council, the Royal College of Pathologists and very many other
scientific bodies. Let me read just three of the comments, the first
from the British Pharmacological Society. I quote it first because two
members of the MHRA, including the chairman, have pharmacological
qualifications. The society
says:</p><ul><a name="06102652000745"></a>&#147;The British
Pharmacological Society believes that any claim for a medicine must be
based on evidence, and that it is the duty of the regulatory
authorities, in particular the MHRA, to ensure that no claims can be
made for the efficacy of any form of medicine unless there is good
evidence that the claim is true. Despite many years of investigation,
we have no convincing scientific evidence that homeopathic remedies
work any better than
placebo&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000707"></a>Please note
that that comes from the chairman of the MHRA, himself a professor of
pharmacology.<p><a name="06102652000303"></a>The Royal
College of Pathologists made the following
statement:</p><ul><a name="06102652000746"></a>&#147;For the
first time in its history the regulation of medicines has moved away
from science and away from clear information for the public. The
College is deeply
alarmed&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000304"></a>Thirdly, I
quote the Biosciences Federation, which represents just about every
relevant professional society in this field and has also expressed its
extreme concern. It
declared:</p><ul><a name="06102652000747"></a>&#147;The new
regulations do not comply with the MHRA&#146;s duty to ensure safety
and efficacy of medicines, and to provide clear, honest advice to the
public&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000305"></a>How can the
Government ignore these concerns? How could the MHRA possibly justify
this regulation? As the Biosciences Federation points out, the MHRA is
in breach of its statutory duties, yet no one from that official body
has come forward to defend its regulation since it became clear that
there is 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1330"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a deep concern in all scientific quarters at what it has done. Both on 1
September and this last week all interviews were refused. That in
itself is indefensible, since the MHRA is supposed to be accountable
and transparent. Anyway, it is not the business of the MHRA to promote
homeopathy or, indeed, any other trade or industry. Its declared aims
include helping people to understand the benefits and risks of medical
products and to communicate reliable information and advice. Are the
Government going to rewrite the objectives of the MHRA to include the
promotion of industry? I hope that the Minister will answer that point
explicitly.</p><p><a name="06102652000306"></a>Can we envisage as a
next step that the MHRA will weaken the requirements of scientific
testing of drugs, because failure to do so would inhibit the expansion
of the pharmaceutical industry? As I said, that is the reason
explicitly given for this regulation in the case of the homeopathic
industry. What it has done is to promote what is in effect the selling
of snake oil. This statutory instrument should be withdrawn&#151;it
is a disgrace. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000307"></a>Moved, That an humble
Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid
before the House on 21 July, be annulled (S.I. 2006/1952). [44th Report

Countess of Mar:</b> My Lords, it was very easy to
predict that the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, would pray against these
regulations, for his views on homeopathy are well known. I declare my
interest in that I use homeopathy for minor ailments and as preventive
measures. I see a qualified homeopath if I have something a bit more
complex and I see my GP if I feel that I need his intervention. I
firmly believe that those of us who do not wish to clog up our
doctors&#146; surgeries with trivial complaints should be allowed to
treat them in whatever way we wish so long as we are armed with
accurate information.</p><p><a name="06102652000309"></a>These
regulations are the result of protracted and wide consultation. They
iron out existing anomalies whereby homeopathic medicines that existed
before 1971 can carry therapeutic indications on their labels while
those registered subsequently cannot. The regulations bring homeopathic
medicines into line with the 2005 legislation on
&#147;traditional-use&#148; herbal medicines. The information
provided is required to be
accurate.</p><p><a name="06102652000310"></a>Homeopathy is widely
used by the general public, who will benefit by being able to choose
remedies for minor, self-limiting ailments such as nausea, headache,
and the common cold. While there have been no clinical trials for
over-the-counter remedies such as cough expectorants, and their
efficacy is refuted in the March 2006 51st edition of the <I>British
National Formulary</I>, homeopathic medicines have been used for more
than 200 years and there is wide bibliographic evidence to support
their use and effectiveness. They are safe and, unlike many newly
developed drugs for which strict testing is required, have never killed
anyone. As the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, should know, the first
principle of any therapy is, first of all, do no harm.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1331"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000311"></a>The noble Lord complains that homeopathy
is not evidence-based. His charity, Sense About Science,
claims:</p><ul><a name="06102652000748"></a>&#147;Evidence-based
medicine has been a major public gain of the 20th
century&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000708"></a>I
agree that it is essential to protect the public from powerful new
drugs, as has been clearly demonstrated by the recent Northwick Park
drug trial that nearly killed six healthy young men. But what about the
case of the withdrawal of Vioxx, in which the drug, used to treat
arthritis, has been estimated to be responsible for between 88,000 and
140,000 extra cases of serious coronary heart disease in the
USA?<p><a name="06102652000709"></a>The evidence base for
many conventional medical treatments is still extremely weak. According
to the recent <I>British Medical Journal</I> clinical evidence review
of 2,404 conventional treatments, only 15 per cent were rated as
beneficial, 22 per cent as likely to be beneficial, 7 per cent as a
trade-off between benefits and harms, 5 per cent as unlikely to be
beneficial, 4 per cent as likely to be ineffective or harmful,
and 47 per cent of unknown
effectiveness.</p><p><a name="06102652000710"></a>Sense About
Science claims that homeopathy is not &#147;evidence-based
medicine&#148;. This is utterly untrue. Despite a chronic
underfunding of research, the effectiveness of homeopathy in many
conditions is supported by randomised clinical trials including for
childhood diarrhoea, hay-fever, post-operative ileus and
osteoarthritis, all of which were the subject of meta-analyses with
positive conclusions. It has proved effective with asthma,
fibromyalgia, influenza, glue ear, side effects of radiotherapy or
chemotherapy, pain, sprains, upper respiratory tract infections and
vertigo&#151;each of which has undergone at least two positive
randomised control trials&#151;as well as with anxiety, ADHD, CFS,
IBS, migraine, PMS, seborrheic dermatitis and tissue trauma, each of
which has been the subject of a single randomised control trial with
positive
results.</p><p><a name="06102652000711"></a>In
addition, the six-year study at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, part
of the United Bristol Healthcare Trust and one of five NHS homeopathic
hospitals in the UK, published in the <I>Journal of Alternative and
Complementary Medicine</I> involved over 6,500 consecutive patients
with chronic diseases. All were referred by their GP or hospital
specialist and many had tried conventional medicine first. There is a
group of patients for whom conventional chemical treatments either do
not work or are contra-indicated. Many find homeopathy helpful. Over 70
per cent of the Bristol patients in this study reported positive health
changes after homeopathic
treatment.</p><p><a name="06102652000712"></a>The
noble Lord states that the rules for the regulation of medicines should
not allow homeopathic products to make unsubstantiated health claims.
Two hundred years of bibliographic evidence, provings and traditional
use are not unsubstantiated health claims. A proving is a qualitative
research study observing and recording the experience of a group of
health subjects who experimentally take a particular drug.
Contemporary, qualitative, narrative-based research methods, which are
becoming increasingly accepted in conventional medicine, are very
similar to the techniques used in homeopathic provings.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1332"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000713"></a>It seems extraordinary
to me that, when faced with a phenomenon like homeopathy which is shown
to work, normally credible scientists discard all the findings of
numerous scientists such as Preparata, Del Guidice, Kunio Yasue and
Louis Rey. Professor Madeleine Ennis of Queen's University, Belfast,
with a large pan-European research team led by Professor Roberfroid of
the Catholic University, Louvain, set out to show that homeopathy and
water memory were utter nonsense. This was an exercise conducted with
extreme scientific rigour. The results obtained were statistically
significant. This was put down to human error. Professor Ennis then
applied an automated counting protocol to the figures. In the end, she
had to concede that high dilutions of the active ingredients in
homeopathic solutions worked, whether or not the active ingredient was
present in the water. She is quoted as
saying:</p><ul><a name="06102652000749"></a>&#147;The
results compel me to suspend my disbelief and to start searching for
rational explanations for our
findings&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="06102652000858"></a>2.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000312"></a>As is the way with the
establishment that so readily dismisses evidence it does not like, the
Royal Society attempted to debunk these results in a BBC2
&#147;Horizon&#148; programme. The experiment appeared on
television but the findings were never published in a proper scientific
journal, unlike Professor Ennis&#146;s research. The 1994 publication
in the<I> Lancet</I> of the results of the double-blind placebo
controlled studies conducted by Dr David Reilly in Glasgow, which
showed that homeopathy worked for asthma, were accompanied by an
editorial comment:</p><ul><a name="06102652000750"></a>&#147;What
could be more absurd than the notion that a substance is
therapeutically active in dilutions so great that the patient is
unlikely to receive a single molecule of it? Yes, the dilution
principle of homeopathy is absurd; so the reason for any therapeutic
effect presumably lies
elsewhere&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000313"></a>Perhaps
the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, and his Sense About Science friends could
be persuaded to suspend their disbelief for a while and, instead of
looking for a biochemical answer, look for a nano-pharmacological or a
bio-physical one. Quantum physics provides a tauntingly fascinating
window on life and it may just be that, instead of opposing something
that he does not understand, his eyes will be opened to a set of
totally new concepts. I remind the noble Lord of a speech he made on 24
June 2004, at col. 323 in <I>Hansard</I>. He might recall that he was
critical of radiation safety standards. In advocating the benefits of
low doses of radiation he described an effect known as hormesis. The
toxicological definition of hormesis
is:</p><ul><a name="06102652000751"></a>&#147;A dose response
phenomenon characterised by a low dose stimulation, high dose
inhibition, resulting in either a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose
response. A pollutant or toxin thus has the opposite effect in small
doses than in large
doses&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000714"></a>If that is
what the noble Lord believes, he should be well on the way to accepting
the principles of
homeopathy.<p><a name="06102652000314"></a>I am glad that the
Government have agreed to bring in these regulations. The range of
products is limited to the treatment of relatively minor, self-limiting
conditions. The regulations will bring uniformity to complementary
medicinal labelling and provide consumers with informed choice. I
ask the Minister to resist the Prayer of the noble
Lord, Lord Taverne.</p>

Turnberg:</b> My Lords, my question for my noble
friend the Minister concerns referral to NICE of homeopathic remedies.
I should declare my interests as an ex-professor of medicine and
ex-president of the Royal College of Physicians.</p><p><a name="06102652000316"></a>I can well understand the
Government&#146;s desire to try with these regulations to remove some
of the confusion that can arise in the public&#146;s mind, given that
homeopathic water marketed before 1971 as a remedy could include an
indication of what it was meant to treat, while water marketed after
that date could be said only to be safe. Now we have the possibility
that water that has been subjected to a &#147;homoepathic
proving&#148;, in the words of the regulations, can have indications
attached. It is unclear to me whether homeopathic proof is simply proof
that is so dilute that none of the original is left, or something else.
One way to find out is to refer this whole question to NICE so that it
can examine it properly. Can I persuade my noble friend to refer
homeopathic remedies to NICE?</p><p><a name="06102652000317"></a>Then there is the question of reporting
of adverse events. That can be best illustrated by the case of
homeopathic remedies for malaria, where I understand that patients seen
at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases have had their definitive
treatments delayed because they have been taking homeopathic remedies.
That is a dangerous side effect of homeopathy, albeit indirect: it
delays curative treatments. The problem here is that such reports go
unreported, either through the adverse events system or through the
drug side-effects route. Will my noble friend consider how such
potentially dangerous effects of homeopathy can be reported in a
systematic way?</p><p><a name="06102652000318"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="06102652001410"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I am glad the noble
Countess is able to enjoy the benefits of homeopathic remedies, even if
she does not know why. I find these regulations very disturbing, as the
noble Lord, Lord Taverne, has already outlined. I referred back to
<I>Complementary and Alternative Medicine</I>, the report in November
2000 of the Select Committee of this House chaired by the noble Lord,
Lord Walton of Detchant. It is, as so many of these reports are, a mine
of information and advice. In the summary of recommendations, the
committee reported:</p><ul><a name="06102652000752"></a>&#147;In
our opinion any therapy that makes specific claims for being able to
treat specific conditions should have evidence of being able to do this
above and beyond the placebo effect. This is especially true for
therapies which aim to be available on the NHS and aim to operate as an
alternative to conventional medicine, specifically therapies in Group
1&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000715"></a>The House will no
doubt be aware that homeopathy was listed by the committee in group
1. <p><a name="06102652000319"></a>However, looking through
the report for greater clarification, I read that: &#147;Many
CAM&#148;&#151;that is, complementary and alternative
medicine&#151;</p><ul><a name="06102652000818"></a>&#147;therapies
are based on theories about their modes of action that are not
congruent with current scientific knowledge. That is not to say that
new scientific knowledge may not emerge in the future. Nevertheless as
a Select Committee on Science and Technology we must make it clear from
the outset that whilst we accept that some CAM therapies, notably
osteopathy, 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1334"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chiropractic and herbal medicine, have scientifically established
efficacy in the treatment of a limited number of ailments, we remain
sceptical about the modes of action about many of the
others&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000716"></a>It is
noteworthy that the Select Committee did not include homeopathy in that
list. That report was published six years ago. Has anything changed
since then? Would a Select Committee looking at that today have
included homeopathy in the list with the other treatments
mentioned? <p><a name="06102652000320"></a>I turn to the
question of research. I listened to the noble Countess with great
interest. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm or comment upon
what she said. The report says in chapter 7, &#147;Research and
Development&#148;:</p><ul><a name="06102652000753"></a>&#147;To conduct research into CAM
disciplines will require much work and resources, and will therefore be
time-consuming. Hence, we recommend that three important questions
should be addressed in the following order:</ul><ul><a name="06102652000754"></a>(i) To provide a starting point for
possible improvements in CAM treatment, to show whether further inquiry
would be useful, and to highlight any areas where its application could
inform conventional medicine&#151;does the treatment offer
therapeutic benefits greater than placebo?</ul><ul><a name="06102652000755"></a>(ii) To protect patients from hazardous
practices&#151;is the treatment safe?</ul><ul><a name="06102652000756"></a>(iii) To help patients, doctors and
healthcare administrators choose whether or not to adopt the
treatment&#151;how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost
effectiveness, with other forms of treatment?&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000717"></a>Has this research been done on
homeopathy? If so, where, by whom and with what results? Has it been
peer-reviewed? I hope the Minister will be able to answer those
questions in his reply. <p><a name="06102652000321"></a>My
central objection to the new regulations is that by bending the
rules&#151;the reference to &#147;proven&#148; results is quite
different from the normal rules about effectiveness and
safety&#151;they appear to give an official imprimatur to treatments
for which there is no scientific evidence of safety and efficacy. I
find that very disturbing, as did the noble Lords, Lord Taverne and
Lord Turnberg. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the
House.</p><p><a name="06102652000322"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew102"></a><a name="06102652001411"></a>Lord
Rees of Ludlow:</b> My Lords, the Royal Society, of
which I have the honour to be president, believes that all
complementary and alternative medicines should be subject to careful
evaluation of their efficacy and their safety. All treatments so
labelled should be properly tested and patients should not receive
misleading information.</p><p><a name="06102652000323"></a>There
are no great concerns about the safety of homeopathic treatments. What
is at issue is their effectiveness. Obviously placebo effects can be
powerful, nobody denies that. It is, however, quite different to assert
that homeopathic treatments offer benefits beyond a placebo. Indeed, if
medicines can really work even when so diluted that barely a single
molecule is left, this would entail some fundamentally new scientific
principle with amazingly broad ramifications. It would mean that
materials like water carry imprints of their past and can remember
their history, as it were, in some quite novel and mysterious way. If
that were the case, it would have fundamental implications for precise
experiments over the whole of science.</p>

on homeopathic remedies should actually be higher, not lower, than for
conventional ones. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.
To put it mildly, so-called &#147;homeopathic provings&#148; seem
to fall far short of that. That is why I wholeheartedly support what
the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, is saying on this
issue.</p><p><a name="06102652000325"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="06102652001412"></a>Lord
Colwyn:</b> My Lords, patients tend to use
complementary medicine as a supplement to orthodox medicine. There is
less emphasis on symptoms and the treatment is usually highly
individualised. Whether the treatment is herbal, essential oils,
acupuncture or homeopathic, it will be influenced by the
patient&#146;s personality and lifestyle as much as by the problem
that is presented.</p><p><a name="06102652000326"></a>Given the
massively high levels of iatrogenic disease and morbidity from orthodox
treatments, I am astonished that the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, can
dismiss homeopathy in such a frivolous manner. He and my noble friend
Lord Jenkin imply that homeopathy can be harmful. I sat on the Select
Committee to which the noble Lord referred and although I do not have
the papers in front of me, I believe we felt that as homeopathic
medicines were basically water, they could not be
harmful.</p><p><a name="06102652000327"></a>Each
year in the UK, about 850,000 adverse effects are caused by orthodox
medical treatment. I am sorry to say that 120,000 of these are deaths.
How can the use of homeopathy compare with this? Where is the logic of
dismissing treatment by a homeopathic product which has never directly
caused a death and, when analysed, is shown to contain no active
ingredient? Is it not unscientific to abandon treatments that are
valued and desired by patients or to dismiss treatments that a
particular lobby just does not
like?</p><p><a name="06102652000328"></a>To say that homeopathy is
not evidence-based is completely untrue. Despite chronic underfunding,
a substantial body of evidence exists to prove the effectiveness of
homeopathy. Now is not the time to list them. The noble Countess, Lady
Mar, mentioned some and the evidence is available. I went on a course
about 15 years ago on the relationship between quantum physics and
homeopathy. I probably did not understand a word I was told at the
time, but at least there was evidence that the two were
linked.</p><p><a name="06102652000329"></a>If homeopathic
treatments are harmful, why is there almost total absence of any
negligence claims to prove the point? Any case against homeopathy must
rest on the argument that the most innocuous of practices may be
harmful if they prevent the patient from seeking other more appropriate
treatment. Despite the persistence of this line of attack and the
anecdotal stories we have heard today, there is no firm evidence to
support it. The homeopathic approach helps patients for whom
conventional treatment has been unsuccessful or has unacceptable side
effects.</p><p><a name="06102652000330"></a>It is
interesting to consider why homeopathy, which of all complementary
therapies is probably at most variance with orthodox medicine, should
have received sufficient support from the Government to be able to
maintain a number of specialised hospitals.</p>

long-standing use and
experience.</p><p><a name="06102652000332"></a>Companies
will now be encouraged to register new homeopathic medicines, with the
option of reregistering certain existing products, and will be allowed
to include information about the treatment and relief of minor,
self-limiting conditions based on the use of the product within the
homeopathic tradition. The legislation will benefit the ever-growing
number of users of homeopathic medicine, and its provisions will
encourage growth in the range of products in the market and enhance the
consumer&#146;s understanding of their
benefits.</p><p><a name="06102652000333"></a>Homeopathic medicines
have been used for more than 200 years and there is wide evidence to
support their use and effectiveness, placebo effect or not&#151;and I
have no problem with the placebo effect. They are safe and have never
killed anyone, unlike many newly developed drugs for which strict
testing is justifiably required. I must resist the
Prayer.</p><p><a name="06102652000334"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="06102652001413"></a>Baroness
Barker:</b> My Lords, it is always interesting to
follow my noble friend Lord Taverne in a debate. I look forward to
taking part in debates with him as he is not only an incredibly
knowledgeable but a very passionate
speaker.</p><p><a name="06102652000335"></a>It is important not to
lose sight of what we are talking about here. We are talking about
remedies for minor self-limiting conditions, such as travel sickness
and muscular pain. Most of the orthodox equivalents for those
conditions would be over-the-counter medicines, which probably have
efficacy rates that are equally
contentious.</p><p><a name="06102652000336"></a>It therefore seems
to me that the principal matter we should address is the extent to
which these products are deemed to be safe and the claims that are made
about them. I agree with what my noble Lord, Lord Rees, said in his
introduction, although perhaps not with his
conclusions.</p><p><a name="06102652000337"></a>My reading of the
order before us is that an extensive process is set out by which
product manufacturers are required to demonstrate safety. There is an
inherent dilemma in the questions my noble friend Lord Taverne poses to
the homeopathic world. While he dismisses their products as being
ineffective and not scientifically proven, he then asks for scientific
proof. I would imagine that those on the other side of the argument
would point out that that is an impossible thing to ask. They cannot,
and perhaps do not wish to, prove what they do in scientific terms. I
am struck by the extent to which we have to try to keep a sense of
equivalence in all of this. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, made an
interesting point about the extent to which homeopathic remedies might
make people present late for conventional treatment. The same
accusation might well be levelled against conventional orthodox
treatments of a minor nature. That is one of the difficulties we
have.</p>

to answer is: what would have been the effect on public health and the
health of individuals had this measure not been tabled and had the MRHA
not set out the requirements that it has? Leading on from that, the key
question for all of us is what the consequent marketing authorisations
will be for these products. What claims will manufacturers be able to
make for them? The phrase &#147;for the relief of&#148; has already
been mentioned. That phrase is used by those whose products for
treating minor conditions such as flu are of a more conventional
nature. I am not sure that they are any more
effective.</p><p><a name="06102652000339"></a>It is important that
we know precisely what the marketing authorisation will be. What
statement will manufacturers be able to make as a result of their
product meeting the regulations? That issue was mentioned in the papers
that we have been given. I note that in the consultation on the
regulations there seemed to be a body of opinion that a product which
had been through this process could be marketed as an anthroposophic
medicinal product. I sincerely hope that that is not the case as that
would be highly misleading for the general public. If as a result of
going through these processes, a statement can be made that a product
is based on homeopathic assessment, that is fair and reasonable. It is
accurate and does not claim to be done on a scientific basis.</p><p><a name="06102652000340"></a>There is agreement&#151;whether
negative or positive&#151;that on balance homeopathy does no harm.
Certainly its efficacy is unproven. We need to be sure that the measure
does not open the way for product manufacturers to take greater licence
than they should on making efficacy claims for products and regarding
the basis of those claims. If the noble Lord can answer those
questions, I shall be content for the measure to
proceed.</p><p><a name="06102652000341"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="06102652001414"></a>Lord
McColl of Dulwich:</b> My Lords, as the noble Lord,
Lord Taverne, has said, if a patient has faith in a remedy, it is
perfectly possible for their symptoms to be relieved, so long as they
are not serious. If, in addition, the patient is made happy by that,
his immune system will work better. There is good scientific evidence
on that.</p><p><a name="06102652000342"></a>One of the problems
with this whole subject is that it is bedevilled by various
organisations putting forward explanations for how these alternative
therapies work. I mention acupuncture <I>en passant</I>. There is no
doubt that acupuncture works, probably through releasing endorphins.
But this business of there being special tracks and of having to insert
the needle in special places is not so. You can stick them in anywhere
and the effect is still the same. In reflexology you will see a diagram
of the foot and various areas described as the lung area, the heart
area and various other areas. What a pity that these strange
explanations are given. Why do they not say, &#147;If you&#146;re
feeling ill and a beautiful young lady comes along and rubs your foot,
you will feel better&#148;? That is perfectly
acceptable.</p><p><a name="06102652000343"></a>Having said that,
alternative therapies have been shown to help with diseases such as
multiple sclerosis and cancer, as NICE has reported. Homeopathic 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1338"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remedies have specifically been proved to help women with PMS. Even if
homeopathic medicines cannot be proved to be positively effective, at
least they do no harm, as has been argued
already.</p><p><a name="06102652000344"></a>The
EU directive, which we were not obliged to enforce, states that, in
order to acquire marketing authorisation, a herbal product must have
been used in medical practice for at least 30 years, with 15 of those
years having been in the EU. This directive covers only products that
are taken orally, used externally or inhaled. It has obviously been
forgotten that there is another route for medicines, especially in
France. Does the Minister have any information on
that?</p><p><a name="06102652000345"></a>Article 8 requires that
the decision to license a medicine is based on the quality, efficacy
and safety of the product. The fees for gaining a licence for a product
will vary according to the number of active ingredients. As some
products contain large numbers of ingredients, this could prove very
expensive. How will it be decided which ingredients are
active?</p><p><a name="06102652000346"></a>Under
the directive, the efficacy of traditional herbal medicinal products
does not have to be supported using clinical studies. That is a great
pity. The pharmacological effects and efficacy must be shown to be
plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience. How will
NICE define &#147;plausible&#148;? NICE determines all its
decisions on the use of drugs on an analysis of their cost and clinical
effectiveness and believes that homeopathic medicines should be treated
in exactly the same way as traditional medicines in deciding whether
the NHS should provide them to the public. What advice is the Minister
now giving to NICE on this
aspect?</p><p><a name="06102652000347"></a>The Conservatives
believe that the NHS should not exclude alternative therapies. If the
NHS rules out providing a herbal therapy, it should do so only on the
basis of indisputable evidence, as is the case with all other
conventional medicines. Equally, if the NHS decides to provide a
particular treatment, this should again be done on the back of
evidence. We see the most effective route as the cost-clinical
effectiveness criteria which NICE employs in the decision-making
process on drug regulation and use. We have always said that as long as
these remedies have been proven to be safe, they should be available to
buy. Consumers are then free to make their own
assessment.</p><p><a name="06102652000348"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew106"></a><a name="06102652001415"></a>Baroness

interest as a trustee of Sense About Science. I believe that the public
damage in these regulations does not lie in the circulation of
homeopathic remedies but in the diffusion of the standard for the

can arbitrate in this area. I hope that the Minister will respond to

<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1339"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000350"></a>I shall try to confine my remarks to
making clear the Government&#146;s role in the regulation of
homeopathic products and explaining the aims of the new national rules
scheme, about which there may be some misunderstanding, given the
remarks made in the debate. I bow to the professional knowledge of the
noble Lord, Lord McColl, on which orifice to use for which
medication.</p><p><a name="06102652000351"></a>The use of
homeopathic products in this country has a long tradition, as a result
of which a wide range has been available and regulated in the UK for
many years. Homeopathic products have, for example, been available in
the NHS since its inception in 1948. Successive Governments have
accepted that homeopathy has its place within the range of treatment
options available to patients. That is a historical fact. This
Government strongly believe that consumers in the UK should be free to
make informed choices about their care, and that includes the freedom
to choose homeopathic products. Whether such products are supplied and
paid for by the NHS is, under current funding arrangements, for local
NHS service providers and primary care trusts to decide. That is
exactly the same system that was in place when the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin of Roding, was a distinguished Secretary of State for
Health.</p><h5><a name="06102652000860"></a>3
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000352"></a>These new
regulations flow from new EU medicines legislation, but it is optional
to member states whether they bring it in. This Government have chosen
to introduce the new scheme because it will improve the regulation of
these products in the UK while continuing to support the principle that
consumers should have the right to choose to use them if they so wish.
Apart from Denmark and France, we are the only EU country so far to
have introduced this scheme that will improve the protection of
consumers who choose to use such products, and we have acted in
patients&#146; interests, not in the promotion of commercial
products.</p><p><a name="06102652000353"></a>Because homeopathic
products are different from conventional medicines, it is right that
they are regulated differently. Their efficacy cannot be demonstrated
in the same way as is required for conventional medicinal products to
obtain a licence, but that does not mean that homeopathic products
should not be available. Having listened to the debate, I am not
entirely clear how such products could ever demonstrate efficacy if
they were totally banned. That would be a challenging scientific
proposition.</p><p><a name="06102652000354"></a>The new national
rules scheme that this Government have introduced provides an
appropriate regulatory scheme that will improve how many current
homeopathic products are regulated. The new scheme continues to give
consumers assurances of quality of manufacture and of safety and will
provide them with better information about the products available. It
develops existing arrangements, which involve two types of
registration. The first is for homeopathic products that were on the
market when the Medicines Act came into force in 1971 which have
product licences of right (PLRs). When these products were included in
that scheme in 1971, producers were allowed to label their products to
say 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1340"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what they could be used for. Many of those products are still on the
market
today.</p><p><a name="06102652000355"></a>The
second regime is called the simplified scheme, which was introduced in
1992, when the EU first produced legislation for homeopathic products.
New products coming on to the market since then have had to comply with
those EU rules or with all the rules for conventional medicines, which
of course would require them to demonstrate efficacy through clinical
trials. Homeopathic products clearly could not do that. Moreover, the
scheme&#146;s products may not be labelled to say what they are
for&#151;that might be a disadvantage for users. In answer to the
noble Baroness, Lady Barker, those existing regulations would continue
if these new regulations were not introduced.</p><p><a name="06102652000356"></a>The introduction of the new national
rules scheme offers an alternative approach that will bring a number of
benefits for patients. First, it will, for the first time since the PLR
scheme in 1971, allow homeopathic products to be marketed with
information to the consumer about what they can be used for. This will
provide better information to the consumer and reduce the risk of
confusion. We expect that some products currently authorised under the
simplified scheme will be switched because they will, for the first
time if they qualify, be allowed to be labelled as suitable for the
relief of specified conditions. However, to qualify for authorisation
under this scheme, the manufacturer has to show, from literature, that
there is a tradition of use of that product for a particular purpose.
So an evidence base is being used, although it may not satisfy everyone
who has spoken.</p><p><a name="06102652000357"></a>Secondly,
homeopathic products authorised under the new national rules scheme are
required to comply with all aspects of the conventional medicines
regime, except the requirement to demonstrate efficacy through clinical
trials. That will bring significant benefits: improved assurances of
quality in manufacture, safety, the review of information given to
consumers, and the requirement to submit regular safety reports to the
regulator and to submit to inspections. All those elements should
reassure consumers, as the measures will enhance safety for those who
choose to use homeopathic products.</p><p><a name="06102652000358"></a>Thirdly, and
importantly, the new national rules scheme provides a possible
regulatory home previously not available when we had only the
simplified scheme or a full licence available for the products with
product licences of right. The MHRA intends to review all the PLRs in
the next seven years to ensure that they are of appropriate quality and
safety. The MHRA will allow only products authorised under the new
scheme to be labelled as suitable for the relief of minor symptoms or
conditions&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, made
clear&#151;products that you would expect to see available on general
sale in, for example, supermarkets.</p><p><a name="06102652000359"></a>This measure, while maintaining
consumers&#146; freedom to choose to use homeopathic products, will
ensure that such products are better regulated and provide more and
better information to the consumer. Furthermore, a mandatory statement
will be included in the pack instructing the patient to consult their
doctor if symptoms persist. Again, that is a new 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1341"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measure that directs people towards conventional medicine if there is a
problem.</p><p><a name="06102652000360"></a>The
Advisory Board on the Registration of Homeopathic Products, a committee
established under the Medicines Act to advise Ministers on matters
concerning homeopathic products, will be instrumental in providing
advice on the indications for, and safety and quality of, products
registered under the new scheme, and on the review and rationalisation
of PLRs. In last year&#146;s review of the medicines advisory
committee, the advisory board was given a new and enhanced role to
advise the Government directly on matters relating to homeopathy. It is
an independent committee whose membership includes homeopathic
practitioners, people with a wide range of clinical expertise,
including GPs, paediatricians, toxicologists and
pharmacists.</p><p><a name="06102652000361"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Taverne, suggested that the Government are bowing to commercial
pressure from the homeopathic industry in introducing this scheme. This
is absolutely not the case. I have had meetings with the homeopathic
industry, and I do not think that it sees us in the light that has been
described this afternoon.</p><p><a name="06102652000362"></a>As I
have explained, the Government believe that the new national rules
scheme provides a significant opportunity to improve consumer
information about the use of homeopathic medicinal products on the UK
market while maintaining rigorous control over their quality and
safety. That will be welcomed by consumers who choose to use those
products for minor conditions or
illnesses.</p><p><a name="06102652000363"></a>Unfortunately, a
number of remarks have been made about the MHRA. It is not in breach of
its statutory duties, nor does it promote homeopathic products on
behalf of the industry that sells them. Having worked with the MHRA as
the Minister responsible for it for two years, I regard it as a
distinguished public body that has done a great deal in this country to
protect the public through the regulation of medicinal products in a
scientific way. The MHRA has a role in not only authorising products on
grounds of efficacy, but ensuring that safety and quality standards are
maintained. It is not concerned purely with
efficacy.</p><p><a name="06102652000364"></a>We accept that this
scheme does not provide any endorsement of clinical efficacy as happens
with conventional medicines. It is not designed to replace the use of
more conventional treatments, which is why it is restricted to products
for the relief of minor conditions that do not require medical
intervention. Central to our policy was the inclusion of a statement in
the product literature advising patients to consult their doctor if
symptoms persist. I believe that the scheme will enable consumers to
make more informed choices about the use of homeopathic products, and
the regulatory regime will ensure that standards of quality and safety
are maintained in the production and use of homeopathic
products.</p><p><a name="06102652000365"></a>That stance in no way
diminishes the Government&#146;s support for evidence-based medicine
or for scientific research into new pharmaceutical products that
benefit patients. We have done much as a Government to support science
and research, and will continue to do so. Homeopathic products are, 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1342"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>however, in a different category. Provided that such products are safe,
properly manufactured and clearly labelled without making false claims,
which they will be under the new national rules scheme, patients should
not be denied access to them for the conditions to which they
relate.</p><p><a name="06102652000366"></a>A number of noble Lords,
including my noble friend Lord Turnberg, raised the issue of NICE. The
Government have no plans to refer homeopathic remedies to NICE at
present. I gently draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the fact that
NICE has quite a few things on its plate at the moment, including many
potentially life-saving drugs. However, there is nothing to stop the
use of the yellow card scheme, authorised under the new national rules
scheme, to be applied in respect of adverse effects to homeopathic
products, as is the case with conventional
medicines.</p><p><a name="06102652000367"></a>I believe that this
is an area where we have to regulate in the way that we have done but,
in our view, we must not deny people the right to use these medicines
when they are safe, manufactured to an appropriate quality and properly
labelled. These are good regulations that should be on the statute
book.</p><p><a name="06102652000368"></a><b><a name="61026-0004.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="06102652001417"></a>Lord
Taverne:</b> My Lords, it would be inappropriate to
reply to the various issues raised in this debate, but I must make a
few very brief points. The intention of this Prayer is not to ban the
sale or diffusion of homeopathic products but to stop regulation that
allows claims of efficacy which do not have scientific proof and which
encourage people to believe that homeopathy works in a way that cannot
be proved. That could have, and has had, serious effects in some
cases.</p><p><a name="06102652000369"></a>I am extremely
disappointed by the Minister's reply because he has not
denied&#151;indeed, he could not deny&#151;that these regulations
turn their back on the entire history of the regulation of medical
products in which such products have been scientifically proved. Nor
did he answer the question about the interests of the homeopathic
industry&#151;indeed, he denied that the regulations had anything to
do with that.</p><p><a name="06102652000370"></a>Perhaps I may read
the appropriate sentence from the Explanatory Memorandum attached to
these
regulations:</p><ul><a name="06102652000757"></a>&#147;Although
the development of national rules ... under the ... Directive
is optional, failing to introduce the scheme would inhibit the
expansion of the homeopathic
industry&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000718"></a>If that
does not mean that the purpose of the regulations is to assist the
homeopathic industry, I do not know what it
means.<p><a name="06102652000371"></a>I should also like the
Minister to look again at the whole role of the MHRA, which has now
abandoned its purpose of guaranteeing the safety and, in particular,
the efficacy of its
products.</p><p><a name="06102652000372"></a>I am
afraid that the noble Lord&#146;s reply will not reassure the
numerous&#151;in fact, almost comprehensive&#151;list of medical
bodies that have expressed extreme concern at the MHRA&#146;s change
of tack. His reply was feeble, and I am sorry to say that the reply
from my own Front Bench was equally feeble. If they are to be taken
seriously, perhaps sometimes they should apply a little intellectual
rigour.</p>

that I do not share the Minister&#146;s faith that future Ministers
will consistently adhere to his undertaking not to pursue controversial
orders and not to undermine the independence of the regulators, welcome
as these undertakings are.</p><p><a name="06102652000381"></a>I was
contacted by a member of the Government&#146;s Better Regulation
Commission who was worried that my amendment would allow the economic
regulators to impose bad regulation on already overburdened businesses.
I have written to the member of the commission to reassure him that the
amendment would not let economic regulators off following good
regulatory practice. Instead, it would ensure that major changes to the
regulators were given the full scrutiny that matters of such financial
significance to every man and woman in this country
deserve.</p><p><a name="06102652000382"></a>We have seen the
Government twist and turn to avoid taking the blame for the mountain of
red tape burying business in this country today. It is time that they
stopped arrogating more and more powers to themselves, while doing
nothing with the powers that they already have. They should clean up
their departments and break their addiction to government interference.
I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000383"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew110"></a><a name="06102652001419"></a>Lord
Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, in supporting this
amendment, I wish to reiterate two points that I made in Committee. It
is important to stress the independence of the economic regulators and
the fact that that independence is not achieved at the expense of
accountability.</p><p><a name="06102652000384"></a>Regulators have to
explain and justify their actions. In the Constitution
Committee&#146;s report <I>The Regulatory State: Ensuring its
Accountability</I>, the point was made that regulators are subject to
what was termed &#147;360 degrees of accountability&#148;.
They are answerable to a range of bodies, including Parliament. They
are bound by statute and can be challenged if they exceed their powers.
Stipulating the independence of regulators does not affect the powers
of Ministers to determine
policy.</p><p><a name="06102652000385"></a>The importance of
maintaining the independence of regulators has been variously stressed,
including by the Government. In Committee, I quoted from the evidence
submitted to the Constitution Committee by the Department of Trade and
Industry. The department said
that,</p><ul><a name="06102652000819"></a>&#147;the
independence of economic regulators from Government&#151;insulating
decisions from short term political factors&#151;is a fundamental
contributor to regulatory certainty and prerequisite for continuing to
attract private finance to regulated
sectors&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000386"></a>There is
thus a compelling case for protecting the independence of
regulators&#151;and to be seen to be so doing. That was the case that
I advanced in 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1345"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee, and my amendment is designed to ring-fence that
independence.</p><p><a name="06102652000387"></a>I
listened with care to the Minister&#146;s response in Committee. His
reasons for opposing the amendment were twofold. One was that the
provisions of the Bill did not create a new position. Regulatory reform
orders under the 2001 Act could be used to change the functions of the
economic regulators and the provisions of the Act, he argued, had not
led to any uncertainty. The second point was that the provisions
allowed for flexibility subject to parliamentary
scrutiny.</p><p><a name="06102652000388"></a>The first point I do
not find compelling. I was a critic of the 2001 Act, and the fact of
carrying over existing provisions is no commendation. It has not led to
market uncertainty because the powers have not been used in a manner
that is contentious. My fears about the provision are more apparent if
I rephrase that and say that the powers have not yet been used in a
manner that is contentious. If the order-making power were to be
employed to try to limit the independence of regulators, it may be
blocked by Parliament, but the damage would already have been done. If
tried once, the potential is always there, and markets thereafter may
be far more wary. The point that has been variously stressed, not least
by my noble friend Lord Onslow, and which the Government appear to have
difficulty in accepting, is that a Government cannot bind their
successors.</p><p><a name="06102652000389"></a>The other point
developed by the Minister is essentially one of convenience. He cited
an example affecting the FSA. I counsel against generalising from an
<I>N</I> of one, which seems to have happened an awful lot in
discussing this Bill. I am not sure that we should concede the general
point of enabling primary legislation to be amended by secondary
legislation because there is one example of that proving useful. The
potential for creating even one case of misuse should concern
us.</p><p><a name="06102652000390"></a>The
Minister&#146;s argument, which is at the heart of what I find
worrying about the Bill, is that because circumstances change, there
may be a case for changing the functions of the regulator and this
could conveniently be done by secondary legislation. In other words, it
is an admission that we did not get the legislation right the first
time round. Had we done so, there would have been appropriate provision
in the Act for amending regulatory functions. We need to think through
what this may entail for the Government&#146;s approach to primary
legislation in future.</p><p><a name="06102652000391"></a>I revert
to the point that I made earlier. I believe that it is important to
protect the independence of regulators and to be seen to be doing so.
That combined with my somewhat purist view of primary legislation means
that I am very happy to support my noble friend&#146;s
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000392"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew111"></a><a name="06102652001420"></a>Lord
Berkeley:</b> My Lords, I have added my name to the
amendment because I believe, as the two previous speakers have said,
that the question of independent regulation is fundamental not only to
regulating monopolies but to attracting private
finance.</p><p><a name="06102652000393"></a>I shall speak mainly
about the railways, because that is what I know most about, and I
declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. In that
sector, &#163;1.5 billion of private investment has been

feel that they are a constraint. It likes them because regulators give
certainty and confidence. Independent regulation is fundamental not
only to attracting investment, but to avoiding, as others have said,
the interference and shocks which would have a disastrous effect on
business confidence. Even while this Bill is going through your
Lordships&#146; House, the Government have introduced a Bill to build
a railway called Crossrail&#151;many noble Lords will know about
it&#151;which does exactly what the Legislative and Regulatory Reform
Bill seeks to do, but for one particular
project.</p><p><a name="06102652000394"></a>Clauses 22 to 44 of the
Crossrail Bill allow the Government to direct the Office of Rail
Regulation to do as it wants&#151;to trample over the rights,
obligations and business prospects of other operators and users of the
railway on the surface. I am sure that your Lordships will consider
that Bill in due course if it gets through the other place. Even while
Ministers are saying that this is all covered, the Government are
already trying to constrain the independence of a regulator. Having
more or less failed to do so on one type of timetabling with Crossrail
in the summer, they have now come back and said that all the
timetabling work&#151;and therefore how much investment there is and
how many trains can run&#151;will be decided by the rail regulator in
accordance with industry processes. Everybody will say that that is
fine, until you go back to Clauses 22 to 44 and find that, if the
Government do not like the regulator&#146;s answers, he can be
directed to give different ones.</p><p><a name="06102652000395"></a>That is unacceptable.
The Government should say, &#147;Yes, there was a problem&#148;,
possibly when Railtrack when into liquidation. People said, &#147;Ah,
the regulator is going to milk the Treasury dry&#148;. I do not
believe that. Since then, however, Parliament has passed the Railways
Act 2005, which puts a little constraint on the independence of the
regulator by saying that the Office of Rail Regulation must have regard
to the funds available to the Secretary of State for the railways. That
seems perfectly fair, but still emphasises the independence of the
Office of Rail Regulation in deciding how those funds should be
spent.</p><p><a name="06102652000396"></a>I could give a lot of
quotations from the passage of that Bill through your Lordships&#146;
House in which Ministers emphasised the importance of independent rail
regulation. If any noble Lord wants those, I can see them afterwards. I
do not need to quote them now, but Ministers emphasised the importance
of independent rail regulation at least three times at various
stages.</p><p><a name="06102652000397"></a>We do not need this
particular section of the Bill for the railways. It would be very
worrying if it is passed as it is. I therefore support the amendment,
which is designed to stop the Government interfering in the work of
independent regulators when the legislation is already
there.</p><p><a name="06102652000398"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew112"></a><a name="06102652001421"></a>Lord

all agreed that the independence of economic regulators must be secured
and protected. They cannot do their job properly if they are liable to
be leant on, especially by the Government. As I understand it, the
Government accept that position. In his reply in Committee, the
Minister said that the Government would be willing to give an
undertaking that the independence of the regulators would not be
undermined. That being so, I am at a loss to understand how they can
object to this amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000400"></a>I
have reread the reasons given by the Minister with great care, and can
find only two in addition to those detected by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton of Louth. The first that I hit on&#151;at col. 1343 of
<I>Hansard</I> on 19 July&#151;was that the amendment would impose
&#147;an unnecessary restriction&#148; on the regulators
themselves. I find it difficult to envisage any regulator who wanted to
undermine his own independence. The second reason was that the
amendment would provide no additional protection, because the regulator
could always be sacked for incompetence or misconduct. I find it
impossible to follow that reasoning and I hope that the Minister will
explain it in due course. In the mean time, I hope that the House will
support this excellent and necessary
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000401"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew113"></a><a name="06102652001422"></a>Baroness
Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I simply want to
ask a question about this amendment and raise some issues. It seems
inappropriate that an amendment such as this should be limited to
economic regulators. The same principles apply to other regulators
across the board. If this amendment were accepted for economic
regulators, some of us in other fields might come forward at Third
Reading with further suggestions.</p><p><a name="06102652000402"></a>I declare an interest
as a regulator, being on the board of the Food Standards Agency and the
deputy chair of the Meat Hygiene Service. The Food Standards Agency
welcomes the structures introduced by the Government to develop better
regulation. Even so, we were extremely concerned about the Bill in its
earlier form. We accept assurances, which we hope that the Minister
will reiterate, that the powers in the Bill will not be used to
substantially amend or abolish the powers of any regulator without
proper parliamentary scrutiny and consultation. I have heard the
Minister say that on a number of occasions, having sat through the
debate this morning.</p><p><a name="06102652000403"></a>It is not
only the economic regulators that wish to retain their independence.
The Food Standards Agency is held in high regard and respect by the
public and there is greater confidence in food standards. That position
was reached through the FSA&#146;s transparency and focus on
consumers. The FSA has a statutory foundation and statutory powers. I
do not need to remind the House of the lack of confidence in food
following the BSE crisis and the work that has been undertaken to take
us to the position that we are in
now.</p><p><a name="06102652000404"></a>In no
way should the Bill favour economic regulators. If it is going to
provide for independence, it should look across the board at regulators
that have highly successful records, which are monitored in

Minister can assure us about that in his reply, we may not come forward
with further proposals, but if this amendment is accepted, we will be

Bradshaw:</b> My Lords, I shall speak about the
railways. The situation that pertained at the time of the collapse of
Railtrack is not the best guide. That was a time when we had very
individual regulators who were not subject to regulatory boards. Since
regulatory boards have been put in place, there is much less likelihood
of a falling out between the Government and the regulators. However, it
would be an advantage if, when the Government wish to make changes,
they sought the agreement of the regulator or his board; if they do not
receive that agreement, they should seek fresh primary legislation so
that the matter can come before Parliament not as an order, but in a
form in which it can be debated
thoroughly.</p><p><a name="06102652000406"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="06102652001424"></a>Baroness

points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris. I do not support this
amendment because the list is too short and it would probably be
impossible to write a long enough one to satisfy me. The major
statutory regulators, for whom independence is important, also deserve
some protection from major interference with their roles and
purposes&#151;indeed, with their very existence&#151;by secondary
legislation. The Minister judged that my previous intervention on this
issue&#151;in Amendment No. 9&#151;was not at the right point. I
hope that this is the right point and that he will give me the
assurance that I sought then that order-making powers are not intended
to erode the independence, the role or the existence of major
regulators that were established by primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102652000407"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06102652001425"></a>Lord

amendment on economic regulators tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Norton
of Louth, and my noble friend Lord Berkeley. Despite the refinement of
the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, the Government remain of the
opinion that an amendment on the independence of economic regulators is
unnecessary. I set out the reasons for that in Committee, but I am
happy to reiterate them for the benefit of noble Lords. We have
reflected on that debate to see whether we can provide further
assurance to noble Lords.</p>

in Committee, and as this amendment seeks to install within the
Bill,</p><ul><a name="06102652000820"></a>&#147;independence
and jurisdiction ... are essential if we are to ensure that
private investors will have sufficient confidence in the regulatory
system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/7/06; col.
1332.]</ul><p><a name="06102652000410"></a>I
agree. This Government are ensuring private investment confidence, and
the UK is seen by private investors as one of the best places for
companies to start, invest, grow and expand. In fact, according to the
recent OECD report, <I>Trends and Recent Developments in Foreign Direct
Investment</I>, the UK was the world&#146;s largest recipient of
inward foreign direct investment in 2005, attracting &#163;91 billion
of FDI, the largest inward direct investment ever recorded in the UK.
Furthermore, the World Bank&#146;s <I>Doing Business 2007</I> report
ranked the UK sixth, out of 175, in the world and first in the EU for
ease of doing business. These statistics alone should provide
sufficient confidence to private investors. However, the question this
House must ask is: did the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, from which the
economic regulators were not excluded, impinge on their independence
and jurisdiction? The answer is no.</p><p><a name="06102652000411"></a>The House must also ask: did the 2001 Act
deter private investment in the UK? Given the World Bank and OECD
reports just mentioned, the answer would have to be: no. The noble
Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, suggested that that was because the powers
had not yet produced that impact, but I thought the argument was that
their existence created the problem. The existence of those powers in
2001 has clearly not created the
problem.</p><p><a name="06102652000412"></a>Finally, one might then
ask: will this Bill, once enacted, deter private investment, on the
basis that investors will see the order-making powers as a potential
power to disrupt the market? On the contrary, the order-making power
gives confidence not just to the private but also the public and
voluntary sectors that this Government are serious about reducing or
removing unnecessary burdens on those sectors.</p><p><a name="06102652000413"></a>Clause 1(3) makes explicit that one of
the Bill&#146;s objectives is to remove obstacles to
&#147;efficiency, productivity or profitability&#148;. Given that
the Government recognise that investment is one of the main drivers to
productivity, they would be extremely unlikely to make, under this
Bill, any proposal that would jeopardise productivity through pursuing
proposals that would undermine investor confidence. Parliament would
also be likely to take a dim view of any such
proposal.</p><p><a name="06102652000414"></a>This House should be
asking itself: will this Bill, once enacted, provide an effective
vehicle for cutting red tape? After two previous Acts I hope that this
House can be confident in itself to reply in the
affirmative.</p><p><a name="06102652000415"></a>I was surprised by
some of the debate in Committee, which seemed to suggest that, using
this Bill, Ministers could amend the regulatory structure on a
whim&#151;for example, by removing the chairman of an economic
regulator&#151;and as though Parliament had no say whatever in the
process. That concern is clearly behind proposed subsection (4) of the
amendment.</p>

course be aware that this Bill has more stringent safeguards than the
2001 Act and includes an absolute and unrestricted right of veto for
Parliament. Ministers cannot act on a whim. They will also be aware
that every order is subject to a statutory consultation process, which
requires the Minister to consult such organisations and persons that
appear to be representative of interests substantially affected by the
proposals, including any body, such as a regulator, whose functions
would be affected by the proposed order. The consultation will provide
the regulator and industry with an opportunity to make their views
known. That point was pursued by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. I hope
that he is satisfied on that, and that it is absolutely
clear.</p><p><a name="06102652000417"></a>The results of this
consultation will influence both the Minister and Parliament in
reaching a decision on the content of the draft order and the
appropriate level of Parliamentary scrutiny of it. The results will
also influence whether Parliament wishes to approve the order, or
whether it exercises its right to veto
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000418"></a>Furthermore,
the preconditions in the Bill and the statutory consultation provisions
are not requirements for making primary legislation, the availability
of which, in itself, does not lead to regulatory uncertainty or act as
an obstacle to private investment. The procedural and substantive
safeguards for any order should provide the reassurance that economic
regulators and their respective markets need that changes to the
regulatory structure cannot be made on a whim. In addition to that
certainty, the Government have said throughout the parliamentary
passage of this Bill that it is not our intention to erode the
independence from the Government of those regulators set up by statute.
I hope that that reassures the two noble Baronesses who have pursued
that point.</p><p><a name="06102652000419"></a>This House will, of
course, also be aware of the Government&#146;s undertaking not to
deliver highly controversial proposals by order. If a Minister decided
to pursue an order in the face of vocal and evidence-based opposition
from a regulator&#151;or, indeed, from the regulated, whom we must
not forget&#151;this undertaking would also influence whether
Parliament wished to approve the order or whether it chose to exercise
its right to veto it. In addition to the protections provided in the
Bill, I reiterate that businesses that are being regulated must have
the right to raise concerns if economic regulators are carrying out
their functions, for instance, overly bureaucratically. If there are
sound reasons for suggesting any modification of their statutory
functions for the purposes of removing or reducing burdens, or of
modifying how those functions are carried out, it should be possible to
address these by order, as it would be possible for any other
regulator. I ask noble Lords why we should not seek to make that
distinction. There should be a level playing
field.</p><p><a name="06102652000420"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06102652001427"></a>Lord

reinforcing the point that these orders can be of benefit to
regulators. I referred in Committee to a consultation on a regulatory
reform order to relax the consultation requirements imposed on the
Financial Services Authority by the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000. This was referred to. I cite one example&#151;we have not spent
a lot of time digging out others&#151;where this was of benefit to
the regulator. If these benefits exist, why should we preclude them
from being obtained through the use of orders under the legislation and
the protections that we have
outlined?</p><p><a name="06102652000425"></a>As I said in
Committee, the economic regulators operate not in a stagnant
environment but in an ever-changing and diverse one, and they need to
be flexible and responsive to the challenges presented by the markets
in which they operate. The House will be more than aware, in this age
of climate change, of the growth of energy self-sufficiency and the
attendant growth of the microgenerator industry. In a press release
issued on 20 January 2006, Ofgem
said:</p><ul><a name="06102652000764"></a>&#147;An increased
interest in the connection of domestic-scale microgeneration equipment

increases&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000426"></a>Following a
consultation on this issue, Ofgem says in its <I>Next Steps</I>
document of October 2006 that it
is:</p><ul><a name="06102652000821"></a>&#147;working to ensure
that obstacles to development of microgeneration are identified and
addressed, and that, where appropriate, we work with government to
ensure that any support is well-designed and works with the competitive
market framework.&#148;</ul><a name="06102652000719"></a>I am saying not that orders under the
Bill are the solution for dealing with those issues, although they
might be, but that this example demonstrates the evolving nature of

Part 1 to their own benefit, or indeed to the benefit of those whom
they
regulate.<h5><a name="06102652000863"></a>3.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000427"></a>I should
also like to add that discussions between Better Regulation Executive
officials and the economic regulators have revealed that economic
regulators are content not to have a total exclusion from the Bill and
that they are exploring the opportunities that the Bill might present.
Given the potential better regulation benefits for the economic
regulators and those they regulate, the stringent safeguards in Part 1
and the fact that the 2001 Act has not led to an environment of
uncertainty in the markets in which these regulators operate, I urge
the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, to withdraw her
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000428"></a>Finally,
I shall pick up on one or two points raised during the debate. As
regards the fact that the RRC and the DPRRC are not whipped, committees
of this House and another place have a statutory right to veto. Whether
that could be used to dispense with the services of the chair of any
regulator was again raised. It is difficult to see how provisions in
this Bill would fall within the vires of the order-making powers in
Part 1, although the provision to sack a chairman would fall within the
vires of the order-making powers of this Bill. There are currently
statutory restrictions on the situation in which the relevant Secretary
of State can remove the chair of a regulator. It is difficult to see
that existing legislation results in a burden of the sort defined in
the Bill. Even if it did, if the burden results only for the Secretary
of State, Clause 1(4) rules out an order-making provision to remove or
reduce that burden. We are faced with a situation where, in order to
protect and ensure that we have independent regulators, we are
precluding a benefit taking place because we are failing to recognise
the safeguards that this legislation provides, which are substantial
and significant.</p><p><a name="06102652000429"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06102652001431"></a>Lord

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, it is on the record
in these debates. The amendment seeks to do a number of things in
addition to that. If the independence of the regulator means that in no
circumstances by way of order could we look to address some of the
regulatory burdens that may be imposed on the regulated, subject to all
the protections in here, it is entirely reasonable that we would want
potentially to raise those matters with regulators. Regulators would
have the opportunity to be consulted, for their views to be known, for
their views to be published, and to influence the process if they
disagree. But what if they agree with the Government? Why does it
undermine their independence if we allow through the order-making
process what they and Government want and what is

seem to be a logical
position.</p><p><a name="06102652000431"></a>We have reflected on
safeguards. For the reasons that I have set out, the Government do not
believe that this amendment is appropriate. Certainly, it is not our
view. It is right to allow economic regulators to have access to a
legislative route to implement worthwhile regulatory reform where
appropriate. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been in
correspondence with a number of the economic regulators on this issue.
Members of this House should be aware that Postcomm, for instance,
on 8 August 2006 in a letter to the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, asked the Minister to consider the application of the
super-affirmative procedure in order to give the industry the maximum
degree of reassurance in relation to the exercise of the powers in the
Bill. Therefore, Members can see that Postcomm has made a suggestion
that we believe could deliver a balance between ensuring that the
order-making powers can be used for appropriate purposes while at the
same time providing, as Postcomm says, the maximum degree of
reassurance to industry.</p><p><a name="06102652000432"></a>Members
of this House will acknowledge that the Government have listened
carefully to this House and the other place throughout the passage of
this Bill. We continue to listen and should Members indicate that they
think an alternative approach to this Opposition amendment is
appropriate, the Government will consider this further and return with
an appropriate amendment at Third Reading. We would of course consult
with Opposition parties on the drawing up of the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000433"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew124"></a><a name="06102652001433"></a>Baroness

spoken today have been in on the Bill from the beginning. I am sorry
that the noble Baronesses, Lady Howarth of Breckland and Lady Young of
Old Scone, have not been able to join us until this late in the day. I
know that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has been very ill following
her riding accident. On behalf of these Benches, perhaps I may say that
we are delighted to see her back in her

Liberal Democrats, which is marvellous&#151;as well as the support of
the expert on the railways opposite. It was absolutely marvellous to
hear him
speak.</p><p><a name="06102652000435"></a>Noble
Lords have been patient and there is no point in reiterating all the
arguments. I do not share the Minister&#146;s faith that future
Ministers will consistently adhere to his undertaking not to pursue
controversial orders and not to undermine the independence of the
economic regulators, welcome as those undertakings are. However, I am
afraid that the shadow of Railtrack still looms over the City. I can
only echo the words of my noble friend: protecting the independence of
the regulator and to be seen to be doing so is the most important thing
we can do here today. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the

19:</p><ul><a name="06102652000765"></a>Leave out Clause
4.</ul><p><a name="06102652000440"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, Clause 4 has aroused some controversy. Whereas the rest
of the Bill envisages amendments, repeals and so on, this clause allows
subordinate legislation to be made by this order. The House of Commons
First Special Report 2004-05 entitled <I>Operation of the Regulatory
Reform Act 2001</I>
said:</p><ul><a name="06102652000766"></a>&#147;The
RRC has suggested that the introduction of a power to sub-delegate will
be a constitutionally significant extension of the RRO process. They
consider that any proposal to introduce a power to sub-delegate will
require very careful consideration by the House and would require
significant safeguards for the exercise of that
power&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000720"></a>People think
it is entirely right that we should have a good hard look at this.
There were debates in Committee, but I do not feel that we have
resolved the problem.
<p><a name="06102652000441"></a>The function of
legislating belongs primarily to Parliament. This clause gives the
power to sub-delegate so that other bodies can use the provisions of
the Bill to legislate. I wonder whether that is correct. Subordinate
legislation usually operates under a specific Act of 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1356"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parliament; Parliament sub-delegates for specific subordinate
legislation, and that subordinate legislation is within the framework
of a specific Act, for a specific task, within a specific timeframe. If
that specific task is not carried out, the subordinate legislation
would be ultra vires and therefore
void.</p><p><a name="06102652000442"></a>However, the danger in
this enabling legislation is that such a general power is being given.
Let me use the analogy of a key: if, in the ordinary way, you give the
Minister a key to a building and then another key to a specific room
inside&#151;that is, the subordinate legislation&#151;you are being
very specific about what he has access to. We are being asked under
Clause 4 to give Ministers a master key which can be used, as it were,
for any room in any building.</p><p><a name="06102652000443"></a>I
understand that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has raised anxieties
about this clause with the Minister. I rely for that on the letter
which the Minister wrote to all of us on 11 October. Under a passage
headed &#147;Sub-delegation&#148;, he mentioned that the noble Lord
had brought to his attention an issue relating to a
clause,</p><ul><a name="06102652000822"></a>&#147;which sets
out the conditions that must apply where Ministers, or other
appropriate persons, are exercising legislative
functions&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000721"></a>I
suspect that many noble Lords present have received copies of the
letter. The Minister
continued:<ul><a name="06102652000767"></a>&#147;I would
like to clarify that it is only in the case that a Minister is
conferred functions of legislating by order that this condition
applies&#151;a provision set out in subsection
(3)&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000722"></a>That was added
at the Committee stage. The Minister went on to
say:<ul><a name="06102652000768"></a>&#147;The provision
reflects recognition that it is not always appropriate for other
persons or bodies to exercise functions of legislating by making
statutory instruments&#151;for example, where a local authority has a
power to make local byelaws. However, the procedural requirements in
Clause 5 which apply to Ministers should not be taken to mean that no
procedural requirements will be attached to a power to legislate
conferred on someone other than a Minister. An order which confers a
power to legislate will need to set out the procedural requirements for
the exercise of that power, which will depend on what is appropriate in
the light of the person who is to exercise the power and the nature of
the legislation which will be
made&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000444"></a>That is all very
well, but there is absolutely no indication of what the safeguards will
be. The House needs to be told what the additional safeguards are to
which the Minister referred in his letter, and which will provide the
protection that we would want to see. The clause gives the power for
subordinate legislation to legislate. That should not be as, by and
large, it appears in this clause. I think that the Minister has
recognised that by saying that there will be limits, but he has not set
out what they will be. Different limits may be appropriate to different
conditions and circumstances. I should be grateful if the Minister
could in his reply give us a clearer indication of what the Government
have in mind for the conditions they will attach to the power to
legislate. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000445"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06102652001435"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the amendment would
remove Clause 4. It may be intended to have the effect of preventing
orders made under Part 1 conferring powers of legislating. However,
since Clause 4 places restrictions on that ability, the amendment would
leave the ability to

remove the restrictions on it.</p><p><a name="06102652000446"></a>I
do not want to repeat arguments which I have set out previously when
discussing the provision in Clause 4, but I will reiterate the key
points that need to be considered when looking at the merits of
retaining an ability to confer powers to legislate by order and of
retaining the restriction on the power currently provided for in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000447"></a>The
ability to confer the function of legislating by order is essential if
we are to ensure that it is possible for orders to deliver large-scale
reforms to entire regimes. As with Bills, it is not always possible, or
appropriate, for all the detail of a statutory regime to be set out in
primary legislation. Powers to make secondary legislation are important
also because some aspects of an order might need subsequent amending or
updating. That is already possible under the 2001 Act, whereby
provisions in orders can be designated as subordinate and be easily
amended in future.</p><p><a name="06102652000448"></a>I am sure
that noble Lords will be aware that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee has commented that including such a power in the Bill
for orders to be able to confer the function of legislating is not
inappropriate. The committee also recommended that the power to confer
legislative powers by order, while not inappropriate, should be subject
to further
restrictions.</p><p><a name="06102652000449"></a>The
Government have responded to these concerns. We have strengthened the
restrictions on the power through the amendments we made to Clause 4 in
Committee. The power to confer legislative functions by order is
limited in important ways by Clause 4. The Bill restricts the persons
or bodies eligible for such powers to three categories. The first is
Ministers, the category of persons most likely to be given powers to
legislate as part of future orders. The second category is persons or
bodies who have statutory functions conferred on them. This will ensure
that powers to legislate can be given only to persons or bodies already
recognised by Parliament as suitable to have functions conferred on
them.</p><p><a name="06102652000450"></a>The
third category is a body, or the holder of an office, created by the
order itself. This will ensure that the Bill can be an effective
vehicle for delivering mergers of regulators, such as those recommended
through the Hampton review, when, for instance, a new body is being
created by order to take on functions of an existing body and the
merger is for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens upon the
regulated. Without the power, it would be necessary to deliver such
valuable reforms in more than one order, using one to set up the
appropriate new body and another to confer functions upon it, rather
than this all being done by the same order. This is something that I am
sure that noble Lords would agree would be unnecessarily cumbersome and
bureaucratic.</p><p><a name="06102652000451"></a>I should also make
it clear that there are of course other important safeguards in the
Bill, including the statutory veto, to protect against the
inappropriate use of this power. Clause 4 also makes explicit that it
will not be possible further to delegate powers conferred by order to
others. Ultimately, however, if Parliament is unhappy with the
proposals to confer 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1358"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions, the order can be voted against. All orders must pass through
the prescribed parliamentary procedure and, if either House objects,
the order cannot be made.</p><p><a name="06102652000452"></a>The
ability for orders to confer powers to legislate, along with the
important restrictions on that ability set out in Clause 4, are a key
part of the order-making powers in the Bill. For those reasons, I
cannot support the amendment and therefore ask that it be
withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06102652000453"></a>The
noble Lord asked, too, what safeguards the order would contain. I have
set out some of them, and am happy to write giving a more in-depth
explanation, but it is worth saying that the order conferring the power
to legislate would in any event have to specify on whom the power was
conferred, the type of legislation they could make and the procedure to
which they would be subject&#151;namely, the negative or affirmative
procedure. I am happy to continue a dialogue outside this Chamber on
these matters if there are details that trouble him and other noble
Lords.</p><p><a name="06102652000454"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06102652001436"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, the Minister reminded
us that if either House uses the veto powers, that is the end of the
matter and the thing has to be dealt with by primary legislation. He
also made it clear that the powers to sub-delegate can be given only to
bodies for which Parliament has already approved power to legislate in
these circumstances. That goes some way to meet my concerns, but it
would be helpful if the Minister could write a letter setting out what
he touched on very briefly at the end of his speech. I beg leave to

that, unamended, the Bill would leave it open for a Minister by order
to reduce or remove taxation. That is not the intention. The first of
these amendments will make it clear that an order under Part 1 cannot
be used to impose, abolish or vary any tax.</p><p><a name="06102652000459"></a>The second amendment concerns potential
tax liabilities that could arise from the merger of regulators. When
transferring regulatory functions from one regulator to another it may
be necessary also to make provision in an order to transfer assets and
liabilities from the old to the new regulator. In certain
circumstances, without further provision, a transfer could result in
inappropriate tax consequences for the transferor or transferee body
that would arise solely because of the transfer. This amendment
addresses those unwanted consequences. It allows the Treasury to make
tax provision by regulations in relation to a transfer of property,
rights and liabilities by an order under Part 1. This power will allow
the Treasury to make appropriate tax

give rise to a tax charge or confer a tax advantage on either party. It
is unlikely that these powers will be needed to be used often, and then
only in the unusual circumstances that a merger is being pursued by
order that involves the transfer of property, rights and liability. I

order-making powers 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1360"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be used to impose or repeal penalties involving fines and
imprisonment. I expressed the view that we had to be circumspect in
providing that any body other than Parliament itself could prescribe
specified offences carrying terms of imprisonment. I tabled amendments
designed to limit the scope for imposing or repealing penalties
carrying terms of
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06102652000466"></a>I
listened carefully to what the Minister had to say in response. My
amendment takes account of what he said. I have decided not to pursue
amendments affecting the repeal or modification of existing offences. I
can see that there may be a case for retaining those powers in order to
remove burdens, but I do not consider that approach the best one. I
would have preferred the proposal advanced by my noble friend Lord
Goschen; namely, that of an annual deregulation Bill, a medium through
which offences could, with Parliament&#146;s assent, be removed or
created. However, if we are to have this Bill, I am prepared to concede
the power to modify or remove existing
offences.</p><p><a name="06102652000467"></a>I think, though, that
there remains a case for requiring primary legislation for new
offences. My amendment provides that no new offences may be created
under Part 1, and that the penalty for existing offences may not be
increased so that they are punishable on indictment for a term
exceeding two years, or on summary conviction imprisonment for a term
exceeding the normal maximum term or a fine exceeding level 5 on the
standard scale.</p><p><a name="06102652000468"></a>The case for the
amendment is straightforward. New offences, especially those carrying
terms of imprisonment, should be introduced through primary legislation
and subject to the full rigours of legislative scrutiny. There is
greater scope for probing and considering amendments than is the case
with the order-making power. Parliament needs to be at its most
rigorous and operating in the full glare of public attention when it
introduces new offences that may result in individuals being sent to
prison.</p><p><a name="06102652000469"></a>What,
then, is the argument for allowing new offences to be created by
secondary legislation? In Committee, the Minister argued that a new
offence would be subject to the safeguard that Ministers would need to
ensure that the preconditions in Clause 3 were met, and that the order
could be vetoed by the relevant parliamentary Committee. He also
pointed out that the provision was carried over from the 2001 Act, and
that the provision had not been
abused.</p><p><a name="06102652000470"></a>Those
arguments are not sufficient to overcome the point of principle in
question. The fact that a provision is carried over from the 2001 Act
is not, to my mind, a commendation, as I variously argued on other
points earlier today. I was as critical of that measure as I am of this
one. The Minister&#146;s own words could be used against him. To
claim that the provision has not been abused is to concede that it
could be.</p><p><a name="06102652000471"></a>In
essence, the choice is between a point of principle and one of
convenience. We may be willing to concede that burdens including
criminal sanctions may be removed by secondary legislation and that
existing sanctions may be modified, but I think we should be extremely
wary of permitting, or continuing to permit, the creation of new
sanctions by secondary legislation. I beg to
move.</p>

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 22
and its consequential Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek, as the noble Lord
described, to prevent any order from creating any new criminal
offence.</p><p><a name="06102652000473"></a>Taken
in isolation, I could understand that the powers to create new offences
might raise some concerns. However, the creation of a new criminal
offence by order could not be done arbitrarily. This ability is
entirely limited by the vires of the order-making powers so that
criminal offences could only be created by order for the purposes of
either Clause 1 or Clause 2; that is, they would have to be for the
purpose of removing or reducing a burden for any person or securing
that regulatory functions are exercised in accordance with the
principles of better regulation. In an order made under Clause 1, the
creation of a new offence would have to be for the purpose of removing
or reducing a burden defined, for example, as a financial cost, an
administrative inconvenience, an obstacle to productivity,
profitability or efficiency or, most importantly, perhaps, in this
context, an existing
sanction.</p><p><a name="06102652000474"></a>Furthermore,
the provisions in Clause 1 provide a power to remove or reduce burdens
resulting from existing legislation and could not be used to create
entirely new regimes. They could, however, be used to replace one
statutory regime with another that is less burdensome for any person.
In such cases, there might be an existing criminal offence which is no
longer considered to be well targeted. This may be, for example,
because it applies to too wide a category of situations or persons. The
order might then contain provision to replace the existing criminal
offence with a new narrow one which was felt to be better focused,
where this was for the purpose of reducing or removing the burden of
the existing wider criminal
offence.</p><p><a name="06102652000475"></a>One
of the key problems with the 2001 Act is that it contained a number of
arbitrary technical restrictions. This prevented proposals from being
implemented in perhaps the most logical way. In some cases, the
restrictions formed such a barrier that it did not make sense to
deliver the proposal by order, delaying or preventing, in our view, the
delivery of better regulation. We need to avoid creating new technical
restrictions, particularly regarding sanctions, which form a major part
of ensuring compliance and hence the success of a regulatory
regime.</p><p><a name="06102652000476"></a>The powers to create new
criminal offences provided for in the Bill are not unprecedented. As
noted in Committee, this power has parallels in the European
Communities Act and as the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, has
observed, was carried over from the 2001 Act. I know he does not accept
the point, but that is the
case.</p><p><a name="06102652000477"></a>Clause 6 also specifies
the limits on the level of sanctions that may be imposed. These are
less than those already contained in a number of regulatory regimes, so
the maximum levels in Clause 6 set meaningful limitations to this
power. Furthermore, the Government have already made a commitment not
to deliver highly controversial proposals by order. Proposals which
create inappropriate new criminal offences will clearly come into that
category, so that is the limiting effect of our commitment.</p>

addition, the pre-conditions in Clause 3 prevent a Minister from making
an order which he considers, among other things, to remove necessary
protections or to prevent anyone from continuing to exercise any right
or freedom which they might reasonably expect to retain. This opinion
would have to take account of any representations received during the
statutory public consultation period and would be scrutinised by
parliamentary committees which have the power, as we have explained on
many occasions, to veto any proposal they consider unsuitable for
delivery by order.</p><p><a name="06102652000479"></a>I understand
where the noble Lord is coming from. I know that he will not find it
easy to accept the constraints which we argue we have put in place
because he thinks we should do this through primary legislation, but I
would invite him to consider that we have provided real constraints and
a narrowing. I hope he will recognise that this is a practical measure
and will withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000480"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew132"></a><a name="06102652001441"></a>Lord
Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I understand where the
Minister is coming from. I was not implying that there was unrestricted
power to introduce through an order a term of imprisonment for anything
other than what is prescribed in the Bill. He is right about what the
measure could be introduced for. It is narrowly limited by the Bill. I
do not question that.</p><p><a name="06102652000481"></a>As the
Minister recognises, there probably will not be a great meeting of
minds on this. I still have two problems with the measure. I would not
object to a change in wording that made clear that where an offence was
introduced it was to replace one in order to reduce a burden. My
concern is with its being introduced completely freestanding as a new
offence.</p><p><a name="06102652000482"></a>I
have two sticking points. One is simply the point of principle. I refer
to the point I made about principle versus convenience. The argument
for the Bill is one of convenience. On the point of principle, even if
narrow limitations are applied, as the Minister said, if the measure
imposes a term of imprisonment that is a new offence. Parliament should
have the opportunity to probe that measure and amend it through primary
legislation. I believe that the Minister referred to it as a technical
restriction. However, I consider that it is a very important point of
principle.</p><p><a name="06102652000483"></a>The other point is
more general and has been an underlying theme of our debates today. The
Minister said that the Government had given an assurance that
contentious measures would not be introduced. As we keep pointing out,
while we accept his word, he cannot necessarily commit his successors.
Given that I have those problems with the measure, I shall want to
reflect further on it. I see the point about the possibility of
replacing an offence. I shall want to reflect further on that, but it
is not a point that I wish to press this afternoon. I hear what the
Minister says, but, as he says, we are coming at the matter from
slightly different perspectives. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000484"></a>Amendment, by leave,

noble Lord said: My Lords, many, though not all, of the orders that
will be made under the Bill will involve changes to or the repeal of
primary legislation. I believe that the basic principle here is that
primary legislation should not be altered by the negative resolution
procedure, as that gives virtually no opportunity for either House of
Parliament to give proper consideration to the matter.</p><p><a name="06102652000491"></a>However, I recognise
that there are exceptions to what I have called the basic principle. I
am aware that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
sometimes accepts clauses in a Bill that provide for transitional or
consequential amendments to be made by the negative resolution
procedure. There may be cases where a Bill contains a power to modify
provisions in that Bill to a limited extent. In such cases, the
negative resolution procedure is appropriate, because the modification
is of no significance. But the negative resolution procedure is used
appropriately only where the powers to be made by the order using that
procedure are very limited and where the ability to make those powers
is closely
circumscribed.</p><p><a name="06102652000492"></a>But
with those exceptions I believe that it is right that primary
legislation should be altered by secondary legislation only through a
process that guarantees that the order is considered by both Houses of
Parliament. I recognise that the procedure for dealing with affirmative
resolution is unsatisfactory, particularly in the other place, but it
is at least better than the negative resolution procedure.</p><p><a name="06102652000493"></a>Given that the Bill
provides wide powers to alter primary legislation and there is no
limitation to the alterations for which the negative resolution
procedure would be appropriate, apart from the general restrictions on
what can be achieved by the Bill as a whole, we should write into the
Bill a requirement that any alteration of primary legislation should be
by affirmative resolution or by the super-affirmative procedure. I beg
to move.</p><h5><a name="06102652000867"></a>4.30

Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to my
Amendment No. 30 in this group. Its purpose is to shift the onus for
recommending the procedure to be adopted for considering an order from
the Government to Parliament. I pursued this issue in Committee, but I
have changed the wording of my amendment to take into account a crucial
drafting point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart.</p><p><a name="06102652000495"></a>The
case for my amendment is compelling and twofold. The first argument is
a matter of general principle. Parliament should have a far greater say
over the conduct of business. As I pointed out in Committee, the House
of Commons is remarkable among legislative Chambers in the democratic
world 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1364"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1364</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the extent to which the business of the House is determined by the
Executive. It is common for other legislative Chambers to have business
committees that determine the allocation of time. That practice does
not prevent a Government from getting their business; the evidence on
that is clear. It is not a blocking procedure, but one that ensures
that time is allocated as is deemed to be appropriate by the House, not
by the Government. That is wholly appropriate; as far as possible,
Parliament should be the master of its own
procedure.</p><p><a name="06102652000496"></a>My
second point is specific to this measure. As I argued in Committee,
there is a danger of Parliament missing the significance of an order.
Under the Bill as drafted, Parliament assumes a reactive role, in which
the onus is on the Minister, and there is a danger that a committee may
not pick up on the significance of an order that is recommended for the
negative resolution procedure but merits more stringent consideration.
A great deal rests on the vigilance of the committees and it is not
clear how busy they will
be.</p><p><a name="06102652000497"></a>My
amendment would place the responsibility on both Houses to check an
order as soon as it is laid by a Minister and to decide whether it
merits being moved from the super-affirmative to the affirmative or
negative resolution procedure. The super-affirmative procedure would be
the default. That would ensure that no important order slips under the
net of parliamentary scrutiny and it would place responsibility for the
procedure where it should be&#151;with Parliament, not the
Executive.</p><p><a name="06102652000498"></a>Because my amendment
was grouped with others in Committee, the Minister dealt with it only
briefly. He covered it in five sentences, only three of which were
substantive. He appeared to consider that losing the reference to a
committee in Clause 15(6)(b) removed an important safeguard and that
the clause, as drafted, provided the right level of detail to ensure
legal certainty. The loss of reference to a committee is not crucial to
ensuring parliamentary safeguards. Each House is likely to establish a
committee, but that is a matter for each House.</p><p><a name="06102652000499"></a>The difference between
the wording of the amendment that I tabled in Committee and this
amendment is crucial in that it requires the agreement of both Houses
to decide that the super-affirmative procedure shall not be employed.
It is thus not possible for a Government secure in their majority in
the House of Commons to utilise that majority to avoid effective
scrutiny of an order laid under the provisions of this Bill. This
House, under this amendment, would thus have an important role to
play.</p><p><a name="06102652000500"></a>The
other point raised by the Minister was an expression of view, but not
one that undermines the case for my amendment. There will be legal
certainty under the procedure prescribed by this amendment, just as
there is under the one proposed by the Government. The Minister
appeared to mix a claim about legal certainty with one about whether
the procedure would be useable. This amendment produces a procedure
that will be useable, but in the context of Parliament determining
which procedure is
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102652000501"></a>I have spent the
past quarter-century arguing the case for strengthening Parliament in
calling the

scrutiny of legislative proposals. I offer this amendment as a small
step in the right direction.</p><p><a name="06102652000502"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew135"></a><a name="06102652001444"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I have Amendments
Nos. 31 and 32 in this group. We have listened to two powerful speeches
that argued for different amendments to strengthen the oversight of
subordinate legislation by Parliament. My wish in relation to this
measure is that we should not use the negative procedure at all. The
scrutiny period is only 40 days. The review that was published quoted
the RRC report on the operation of the 2001 Act and concluded
that,</p><ul><a name="06102652000823"></a>&#147;we have yet to
see any hard evidence that a period of less than 60 days for the
initial scrutiny period would be
appropriate&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000503"></a>I shall
not argue that we should have only the super-affirmative procedure but,
in view of the nature of the orders being made under this Act and the
fact that we are, as it were, delegating blind, because one does not
know what is going to come, it seems to me that an affirmative
procedure throughout would be appropriate. I recognise that the
ordinary affirmative procedure gives only 40 days; nevertheless, it
requires an affirmative vote in both Houses before the order can be
made. On the other hand, the negative procedure&#151;over the years
one has recognised, as others have said, that this is a pretty feeble
form of parliamentary scrutiny&#151;requires that there should be a
Prayer and that time should be found to debate the Prayer and so on.
From experience, one knows just how difficult it is to persuade the
business managers to find time for a Prayer that they do not like. For
that reason, I argue that the procedure should only be affirmative. My
amendments would take out the references to the negative procedure and
would remove Clause 16, which sets out the conditions for the negative
procedure.</p><p><a name="06102652000504"></a>We have had three
options, to which the Minister will no doubt wish to reply. The noble
Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that if you are amending primary legislation,
it should certainly always be affirmative. My noble friend Lord Norton
of Louth made a very powerful case for strengthening parliamentary
procedure and, in particular, for giving power over the decision on
business. I would have no negative procedure at all. I suppose it is a
case of divide and rule, but we do not like what is in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000505"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06102652001445"></a>Baroness
Young of Old Scone:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendment No. 28. I am in the same quandary over this issue: I do not
think that the Bill is right but I am not sure what
&#147;right&#148; would look like. Amendment No. 28 has merits and
demerits. Its merits are that it could ensure&#151;I keep hammering

alas, some primary legislation gets stuffed with small and rather less
important detail, which needs to be changed. I am as guilty of that as

painfully aware. I would not want to see a change in the Bill that

burdens are not disproportionate and that changes to legislation can
happen
quickly.</p><p><a name="06102652000507"></a>With
regard to Amendment No. 28, I do not think that the primary nature of
the legislation is the issue. Much primary legislation does not concern
matters of high importance but deals in the detail to which I referred.
It is the degree of controversy or agreement that should be the
touchstone or the fundamental nature of the change. Again, I go back
to, for example, changes in the role, powers or existence of a
regulator established by
statute.</p><p><a name="06102652000508"></a>During the debate on
Amendment No. 18, I was encouraged when the Minister hinted that there
might be some movement by the Government to bring forward an amendment
at Third Reading to specify in the Bill when the affirmative or
super-affirmative procedure might be required. I hope that I did not
misunderstand him and that we can press him to give us more information
today about his hint before this matter is put to the test&#151;if,
indeed, it
is.</p><p><a name="06102652000509"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06102652001446"></a>Lord
Desai:</b> My Lords, I am not persuaded by the idea
put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, that somehow
committees of the House can be very busy and that both Houses should
consider such matters on the Floor. My experience is that committees
scrutinise such matters more thoroughly over more time. When the whole
House discusses such issues, the debates are either at a very obscure
time or they tend to be rushed. Eventually the orders made under the
Bill will not be major orders. I know that the Opposition pretend that
this Bill will change the constitution, but it is just about red tape.
If we want to expedite the cutting of red tape, we should have a
committee that looks at the matter carefully and quickly, and reaches a
decision. Leaving the matter to both Houses will take much more time
and could be, dare I say it, much more
sloppy.</p><p><a name="06102652000510"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06102652001447"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, this has been a
valuable mini-debate on the appropriate level of scrutiny for a draft
order. In his brief contribution, the noble Lord, Lord Desai, put his
finger on it. It is about having something that is appropriate to the
scale and level of the
problem.</p><p><a name="06102652000511"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said that there was a commonality of view but
that there were different solutions on offer as amendments, which I
shall work through. The first amendment&#151;Amendment No.
28&#151;would prevent any order made under Part 1 from being
delivered by the negative resolution procedure, if it amends or repeals
existing primary legislation. That is an important caveat. As I said in
Committee, the amendment would effectively remove the option of
negative resolution for all orders, as most, if not all, made under
Clause 1, will include provisions to amend or repeal primary
legislation. For this reason, in addressing Amendment No. 28, I also
need to consider Amendments Nos. 31 and 32, which would remove Clause
16&#151;the negative resolution procedure&#151;from the Bill
altogether.</p><p><a name="06102652000512"></a>During our previous
debate on this issue, I was delighted when the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart, in 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1367"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>speaking in support of an amendment that is not dissimilar to Amendment
No. 28, agreed&#151;I think that he may have repeated it this
afternoon&#151;that there may be draft orders that are suitable for
delivery by the negative resolution procedure. That is how I understood
the noble Lord to address the issue then. However, the Government
believe that for all orders it is appropriate that the level of
scrutiny is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the
content and impact of the proposals in a draft order. Where orders are
evidently straightforward, we should&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord
Desai, picked up&#151;maintain the option of delivering them by what
is, after all, a proportionate
procedure.</p><p><a name="06102652000513"></a>Furthermore,
Clause 15 ensures that the final decision on the appropriate procedure
for an order is left to the House. In a sense, we satisfy a point
raised by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. Parliament should be
the master of the process. It is right that Parliament will determine
whether, and on what basis, an order should be subject to the negative,
affirmative or super-affirmative procedure; it may decide, in any case,
that there will be a more onerous level of scrutiny. It is for these
reasons that I urge noble Lords not to press their
amendments.</p><p><a name="06102652000514"></a>The
second amendment in this group&#151;Amendment No. 30&#151;removes
the provisions set out in Clause 15 for determining the level of
scrutiny for a draft order. It replaces these with the condition that
all orders are to be subject to the super-affirmative resolution
procedure unless both Houses of Parliament require a less onerous
procedure. From this and earlier debates on a similar amendment tabled
by the noble Lord, I understand that the amendment seeks to ensure that
Parliament has a proactive role in determining the level of scrutiny
and does not miss the significance of a particular
order.</p><p><a name="06102652000515"></a>As I
have just stated, Clause 15 already provides that either House may
require that an order proceeds via the more onerous super-affirmative
procedure, and the final decision on the level of scrutiny is left to
the House to determine. I also should reiterate that I fail to see the
value in preventing a Minister from even recommending a level of
scrutiny. A Minister&#146;s opinion will not be made in isolation,
but will take into account any representations received during the
statutory public consultation period. The opinion is there to add some
benefit, advice and guidance from the ministerial perspective, but it
does not have to be the final determinant.</p><h5><a name="06102652000868"></a>4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000516"></a>I also question the value of
removing the reference to the parliamentary committees&#146; ability
to recommend that a different scrutiny procedure should apply. These
committees evidently have considerable expertise in assessing orders
under the 2001 Act, and would be well placed to recognise proposals
that should be subject to more onerous procedures. Why take that away?
Indeed, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee,
responsible for scrutinising orders laid under the 2001 Act, stated
that it agreed,</p>

either House or a Committee to consider the proposed procedure and if
necessary &#145;upgrade&#146; it&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102652000517"></a>Furthermore, it is not clear from this
amendment how the process of determining the procedure would work in
practice&#151;specifically, how the noble Lord envisages that an
agreement would be reached between the two Houses, and how this process
would affect the time periods provided for scrutinising the proposals.
I am not sure how any conflict would be resolved in that
situation.</p><p><a name="06102652000518"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Norton, asked whether Parliament might miss the significance of an
order. Well, committees have 30 days in which to recommend a more
onerous process. During that time, they will be scrutinising the
content of the order, so it seems unlikely&#151;very
unusual&#151;that they would miss the significance of an order during
that timeframe, not least because they have great levels of expertise,
as we have discovered over the years.</p><p><a name="06102652000519"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Young of Old Scone, probed the offer that we made earlier in the
debate. We will give further consideration to that, and I am grateful
to her for reminding us not to put it to one
side.</p><p><a name="06102652000520"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06102652001448"></a>Lord

improvement on the present situation in the Bill. Having said that, I
recognise that Clause 15 of the Bill allows either House to require
that anything introduced under either the negative or the affirmative
resolution procedure can be upgraded as a result of the decision of
either House of Parliament. That being so, the difference between what
has been proposed in this group of amendments and the Bill as it now

be made that the provisions of a draft order put before either House
are compatible with convention rights. That requirement is based on
Section 19 of the Human Rights Act. It does not, of course, include the
second limb of Section 19, which enables a Minister to make a statement
that the Bill is incompatible with the convention rights but the
Government wish to proceed with it. I think that has happened only
once, when an amendment was made to a Bill in your Lordships&#146;
House against the wishes of the Government, who took the view that it
was inconsistent with the Human Rights Act, therefore they had to make
a statement of incompatibility when the Bill moved to the
Commons.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1369"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000526"></a>It is plainly
inappropriate that the procedure under the Bill should be used if the
Minister is unable to give a statement of compatibility. Any order made
under those circumstances would be seriously controversial, and it
would therefore be wrong to introduce it. A Minister should be able to
give an order a declaration of compatibility before it can be
introduced.</p><p><a name="06102652000527"></a>In
practice, a statement of compatibility does not apply to primary
legislation only; it has also become a convention that one is made in
the case of statutory instruments subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure, as a result of a decision pronounced some years ago by the
late Lord Williams of Mostyn. It is plainly appropriate to require a
statement of compatibility for draft orders made under the Bill. This
simple amendment would involve no difficulties in practice but it would
at least concentrate the Government&#146;s mind on the human rights
implications of a draft order before they introduce it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000528"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew141"></a><a name="06102652001450"></a>Lord

on this occasion.</p><p><a name="06102652000531"></a>Before I turn
to this specific amendment, it may assist the House if I first address
some confusion about the interpretation of the Human Rights Act that
arose in Committee. As your Lordships will be aware, the Human Rights
Act gives effect in our law to rights drawn from the European
Convention on Human Rights; those rights are known as the convention
rights. Section 6(1) of the Act makes it unlawful for a public
authority to act in a way which is incompatible with the convention
rights. A Minister of the Crown is a public authority for those
purposes and is therefore bound to act compatibly with the convention
rights when discharging his or her duties. Parliament is, however,
expressly excluded from being a public authority by virtue of Section
6(3).</p><p><a name="06102652000532"></a>When a Minister seeks to
make secondary legislation, whether under the Bill or otherwise, he is
therefore legally required to do so compatibly with the convention
rights because secondary legislation is made by Ministers and
scrutinised by Parliament, rather than being made by Parliament itself.
If secondary legislation is not compatible with the convention rights,
the court may strike it down, as it would if the Minister had acted
<I>ultra vires</I> in any other way in making it. Your Lordships will,
of course, know that the Human Rights Act does not allow a court to
strike down primary legislation; instead, a court may draw incompatible

of
incompatibility.</p><p><a name="06102652000533"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, drew attention in Committee to a provision
in Section 21 of the Human Rights Act under which secondary legislation
that amends primary legislation is treated as primary legislation for
the purposes of the Act. However, if one looks to see where the
distinction between primary legislation and secondary legislation
arises in the Act, one finds that it has a bearing only on the remedies
available to the court should it find the secondary legislation
incompatible. In particular, the distinction does not arise in Section
6 and therefore does not change the position that a Minister who makes
incompatible secondary legislation is acting
unlawfully.</p><p><a name="06102652000534"></a>I know that we will
come later to the noble Lord&#146;s other amendment, which would make
it possible for a court to strike down all secondary legislation made
under this Bill, whether or not it amends primary legislation. However,
even without that amendment, the position remains under the Human
Rights Act that it is not unlawful for a Minister to make secondary
legislation that is incompatible with the convention
rights.</p><p><a name="06102652000535"></a>This amendment would
require that all secondary legislation made under this Bill would have
to be accompanied by a statement of compatibility, similar to the
Section 19 statement that appears on the front of every Government Bill
presented to the House. In nearly every case&#151;including this
Bill&#151;this is a statement of compatibility under Section 19(1)(a)
of the Human Rights Act. It certifies that, in the opinion of the
Minister in charge of the Bill, its provisions are compatible with the
convention rights.</p><p><a name="06102652000536"></a>It is
possible for a Minister to make an alternative statement under Section
19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act. Such a statement indicates that,
although the Minister cannot make a statement of compatibility, the
Government nevertheless wish the House to proceed with the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000537"></a>The Section 19 statement
reflects an important distinction under the Human Rights Act: that
Parliament is still permitted to act incompatibly with the convention
rights. Noble Lords will note that Parliament is expressly excluded
from being a public authority in section 6(3) of the Human Rights
Act.</p><p><a name="06102652000538"></a>It is, however, proper that
if the Government are going to ask Parliament to legislate
incompatibly, we should be absolutely clear when doing so, which is the
point of the Section 19 statement. The option to act incompatibly does
not arise for secondary legislation, as I have explained. Therefore,
the statement of compatibility with which the Government accompany
certain secondary legislation as a matter of convention when it is
being scrutinised by Parliament serves only to confirm that the
Minister considers the instrument to be compatible. It would,
therefore, already be unlawful for the Minister to make secondary
legislation that is
incompatible.</p><p><a name="06102652000539"></a>If
a Minister were to indicate that proposed secondary legislation is not
compatible with the convention rights, he would effectively be
admitting that he was intending to act unlawfully in making it. It is
for that reason that I must oppose the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.

Bill or any other Act that are incompatible. However, providing in
statute for a statement similar to Section 19 could wrongly give the
impression that the genuine alternative of acting incompatibly is open
to the Minister.</p><p><a name="06102652000540"></a>I hope that I
have explained clearly why the Government cannot support the amendment.
They will continue as a matter of convention to make such statements,
but we would oppose any move to require this in statute for the reasons
I have given. I hope that the noble Lord, having followed that, will
withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000541"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew144"></a><a name="06102652001453"></a>Lord
Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I am a little puzzled by the
explanation given by the Minister. He started by saying that it would
be unlawful for any Minister to introduce secondary legislation that is
incompatible with the Human Rights Act. As I understood it, he then
went on to suggest that, notwithstanding that, it would be possible to
make, presumably by using an order, alterations to primary legislation,
which by virtue of Section 21(1) of the Human Rights Act would not
themselves be unlawful but would have to be dealt with as a matter of
incompatibility. Those statements do not seem to fit together very
clearly.</p><p><a name="06102652000542"></a>Presumably, before the
order is submitted to Parliament, when it is in draft, it would be
possible to go to the court to say that the Minister had acted
improperly because he is introducing legislation which we believe is
incompatible with the Human Rights Act, and perhaps to get the court to
make an order to stop him proceeding any further with that order. At
what stage, if any, does the court become unable to affect the
proceedings for the order that introduces something incompatible,
except by declaring incompatibility? I am puzzled by this. I will read
what the Minister has said in <I>Hansard</I>, but if I am not
satisfied, I may feel it necessary to re-table the amendment at Third
Reading in the hope of getting more clarification of what the Minister
and the Government think the actual position is. For the time being, I

and believe that its views must be greatly respected. If its view was
adopted, we would avoid the difficulties that seemed to arise in the
debate on Amendment No. 29, because it would be perfectly clear that
the court would have the power to strike down an order that was
incompatible in the same way as it can strike down an order that is

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in proposing this amendment, seeks strangely
to replicate a similar provision in the Civil Contingencies Act. There
is a considerable difference between orders made under that Act and
orders made under the Bill, in that the former have only a short-term
effect, usually for a maximum of 30 days, if I correctly recall that
legislation, on which I spent some time. The problems of
retrospectivity do not arise if they are struck down. In contrast,
orders made under the Bill are intended to make permanent amendments to
the law.</p><p><a name="06102652000553"></a>This amendment would
also lead to a situation where provisions of primary legislation would
be divided into different categories. Whether or not the courts could
strike the provisions down would depend on whether they had been
inserted or amended by subordinate legislation. In some cases, it might
be very difficult to disentangle what could be struck down and what
could not be. This situation does not technically arise under the Civil
Contingencies Act because orders under that Act disapply or modify the
application of primary legislation, rather than make textual amendments
to it. There are of course other powers to make secondary legislation
which textually amends primary legislation. For the purposes of the
Human Rights Act, none of these is subject to the rule which Amendment
No. 33 seeks to impose on orders made under this Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000554"></a>I have already explained why emergency
regulations made under the Civil Contingencies Act are very different
from those made under this Bill and secondary legislation made under
other enabling powers. Given the other safeguards in this legislation,
I do not accept that it is necessary to change the way in which
Parliament has decided in the Human Rights Act that incompatibility
with the convention rights should be dealt with. I should reiterate the
Government&#146;s clear interpretation that it is already

proposing appropriate remedial action to Parliament. For those reasons,

including any increase in regulation that may

noble Lord said: My Lords, this new amendment develops some amendments
which were tabled in Committee. It would require departments to report
to Parliament about their steps to reduce regulation and any orders
they have made under this Bill. It also addresses the possibility of
changes in regulation leading to an increased burden. The previous
amendments were criticised by the Government for wasting
Parliament&#146;s time or for being unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06102652000560"></a>This amendment would ensure that
departments make public their steps to reduce regulation. There is
already a better regulation portal on the web under the Cabinet Office.
While this is a good way to encourage people to report instances of bad
regulation, it is not enough to hold the Government to account.
Publishing proposals and their responses will save departmental time
wasted on responding to duplicate proposals. It will highlight the
possibility of making proposals to the wider public and will allow
people to show additional support for a proposal already made. The
increased transparency would also show what departments were doing

increase will provide greater accountability and invite greater rigour
in judging whether the increases are necessary. I beg to

Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I rise briefly because
I have added my name to the amendment. It strikes me as extremely
sensible, not least for the reason just given by my noble friend, which
is one of transparency. One would hope that it might also act as an
incentive to Ministers actually to get on with deregulation. As we
discussed at Second Reading, the real problem is not with Parliament,
but with government. Anything that gives a spur to action is to be
welcomed.</p><p><a name="06102652000562"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew151"></a><a name="06102652001460"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I start by thanking
the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, for introducing the amendment,
and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, for his contribution.
Although we are unable to accept it, I have an opportunity to explain
what the Government are doing in this area. Amendment No. 34 concerns
the procedures in place for ensuring progress in delivering the better
regulation agenda. I support the notion that we should be looking
constantly to see how well reforms are working. Indeed, no one could
argue that this Government do not take seriously their commitment to
regulatory reform. Government departments already report on their
better regulation work as part of their annual reports, and they have
done so for the past two years. Departments are being asked to provide
rolling programmes of simplification and set targets for reductions in
administrative burdens. Simplification plans will be published shortly.
Plans will clearly be expected to list all better regulation proposals
developed by departments and summarise how measures to reduce
regulatory burdens will be taken forward. Where these proposals require
amendments to primary legislation, they may well benefit from the
powers in this Bill, and to ensure effective delivery without the need
to wait for a
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000563"></a>The
better regulation portal referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, is
also available to provide an opportunity for businesses, public and
voluntary sector organisations, and individuals to make suggestions for
where regulation could be simplified. Work is being done to make this
process more transparent and to make public all proposals received,
along with the departmental responses to those
proposals.</p><p><a name="06102652000564"></a>Our commitment to
deliver on the better regulation agenda is evident in our achievements
to date and in our ambitious programme to build on these successes. We
have listened to businesses, public and voluntary sector organisations
in order to take forward one of the most radical regulatory reform
agendas in the world. My concern with the specific amendment proposed
here is that in practice it would both replicate existing efforts and
impose an unnecessary and bureaucratic set of statutory requirements on
departments. What we do not need is a prescriptive and inflexible
target on the statute book, especially one which requires that
departments focus on continual reporting and detracts from real

to submit an explanatory document to Parliament when laying a draft
order including an assessment, so far as appropriate, of the extent to
which the order would remove or reduce any burdens. The amendment would
further duplicate the requirements on departments to conduct
comprehensive impact assessments on all new proposals for regulatory
reform.</p><p><a name="06102652000565"></a>The independent Better
Regulation Commission will scrutinise and comment on simplification
plans. We also expect the Regulatory Reform Committee in the other
place to play a key role in monitoring departments&#146; progress. We
have been working closely with the committee to develop a new and
expanded remit to enable it to report on wider regulatory reform
issues. Its wider role will complement the work of relevant committees
of this House in ensuring that there are consistent and focused efforts
to deliver on the Government&#146;s commitment to ease burdens across
sectors in the UK. We welcome engagement and suggestions from
committees of both Houses on the agenda. For these reasons, I consider
the amendment unnecessary and I urge the noble Lord to withdraw
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000566"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew152"></a><a name="06102652001461"></a>Lord

think it is regrettable that the transparency which this amendment

enable any lack of action or action to be monitored by a much wider
public. It would perhaps bring those Ministers reluctant to deregulate

set out the problem so that the House can understand what I am talking
about.</p><p><a name="06102652000575"></a>The problem concerns the
formulation of criminal offences which arise out of the transposition
of European instruments into British law. Let me give an example of
this. Under instrument 1228 of this year&#151;which covers the very
important subject of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy&#151;where any premises are occupied and licensed, an
occupier commits an offence if he maintains and operates the premises
other than in accordance
with,</p><ul><a name="06102652000825"></a>&#147;the requirement
of the Community TSE Regulation and these
Regulations&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102652000723"></a>and
there are some fairly substantial penalties.
<p><a name="06102652000576"></a>How do you comply with the requirements
of the Community TSE regulations? The instrument earlier
states:</p><ul><a name="06102652000792"></a>&#147;Expressions
that are not defined in these Regulations and occur in the TSE
Community Regulation&#148;,</ul><a name="06102652000724"></a>have the same meaning here as they do
there.<p><a name="06102652000577"></a>So what is the TSE
regulation? It is contained in a schedule and consists of a list of 27
different instruments which have emerged from the European Commission
over a period of time, some of them quite recent but many of the
amending others. Nowhere in the regulation is there a definition of the
offence, simply that you can fail to comply with
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000578"></a>The Bill
is about transparency and reducing burdens, and, under the terms of the
Bill, &#147;burdens&#148; include criminal sanctions. It is
ordinary good sense that people should understand what they are
forbidden to do. I think it is also in accordance with Article 7 of the
European Convention on Human Rights that they should know this. There
has, however, occurred a massive practice of simply transposing
European regulations without ever saying what they mean and what are
the offences created under them.</p><p><a name="06102652000579"></a>I have been very
worried about this. I have been sitting on the Merits Committee for
some time and British regulations after regulations occur where we have
exactly this problem. I was greatly relieved to find that I am not
alone in being upset about this. In the Third Report of the Joint
Committee on Statutory Instruments in 2001, the committee, which, of
course, contains members of this House and another place, concluded
that in its view the regulation it was considering&#151;it was in
exactly the same form as the one I have been talking about&#151;was
not consistent with the United Kingdom&#146;s traditional legislative
practice of precision in the formulation of criminal offences, and it
reported that provision for defective drafting. But nothing has been
done and the situation continues as before. When we asked in the
committee why this was so, one of the answers was that &#147;because
EU Regulations&#148;&#151;the TSE one was a
regulation,</p><ul><a name="06102652000826"></a>&#147;are
directly applicable in law in all countries, normal drafting practice
is to avoid repetition of EU regulations provisions in domestic
legislation, as it may result in duplication or in the meaning of
effect of the Regulations being obscured&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000725"></a>I doubt whether it could be much more
obscure than it is at the moment.
<p><a name="06102652000580"></a>That is not true. I am talking in
particular about Defra regulations but this applies to other 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1377"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>departments as well. Some other regulations were recently produced by
Defra where exactly the opposite of what I have just read out has been
applied. SI 2005/3522 related to the disposal of older cattle and
slaughterhouses. I drew it to the noble Lord&#146;s attention in
Committee but he did not comment on it. In the schedule is a parallel
set of columns. The first refers to the provision of the Commission
regulation that the SI is referring to, while the second contains the
subject matter of the offence that will be committed if you do not pay
attention to it. So it is not true that you do not put into the British
regulation some indication of what you must do to avoid getting into
trouble.</p><p><a name="06102652000581"></a>There was another very
good example in SI 2006/1970 relating to sea fisheries. Here
is a whole collection of requirements, again relating to a Council
regulation about fishing, fines, and so on. There are three columns:
the first refers to the provision of the regulation; the second refers
to the subject matter of the offence which you would commit if you were
not careful; and in the third column is a very large sum which you are
liable to by way of a fine if you offend. That comes from the same
department which said it was impossible to put this into British
regulations. There they are. As I said, it is not simply Defra which
does this; a number of other departments, including the DTI, do the
same.</p><p><a name="06102652000582"></a>We do not comply with the
transparency provisions underlined by the Bill and we do not comply
with the reduction of sanctions in the term of what constitutes a
criminal offence underlined by the Bill. The noble Lords, Lord McKenzie
of Luton and Lord Bassam, have taken a good deal of trouble to have a
meeting with me and to discuss these points with officials, and I am
very grateful to both of them. I am told that they do not like my
amendment. Well, there is nothing new in that, is there? What amendment
has ever been liked by Government? Nevertheless, I think they concede
that there is a point. I see them nodding, which means that perhaps
there is a point.</p><p><a name="06102652000583"></a>The noble
Lords have suggested that this problem should go to the review being
carried out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson of Glen Clova,
which is to report very soon. I was today given the consultation
documents that have so far emerged. This is primarily concerned with
that very eminent topic, gold plating, and its two close friends,
double banking and regulatory creep. I do not think that the terms of
reference are entirely apt to deal with what I am talking about, but
there is a passage that gives me a little cause for
encouragement.</p><p><a name="06102652000584"></a>The
noble and learned Lord refers to the tradition of precise drafting,
aimed at reducing uncertainty in this country, and contrasts it with a
more purposive approach adopted by the legal systems of some
continental member states as well as by the European Commission, which
broadly speaking deals in civil law rather than common-law terms, and
the methods with which we are familiar in this
country.</p><p><a name="06102652000585"></a>If the Minister is
going to say that he does not like my amendment, I shall not be
surprised, but something here needs to be attended to. It is not just 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1378"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>businesses and charitable and voluntary organisations which are affected
by these rules; it is also individuals We cannot have a situation where
a farmer confronted with this kind of regulation would have to spend a
great deal of time looking up, for instance, 27 different
European instruments on the internet, if they have it and are able to
use it, and then see whether what they were doing
complied.</p><p><a name="06102652000586"></a>This approach has been
criticised also by those whom we in the committee have in our turn
criticised as being faulty because what is done in this country might
not be the same as what is done in other European states. A recent
example in the latest report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments
Committee will come before your Lordships, and some noble Lords might
like to think about it.</p><p><a name="06102652000587"></a>An
ancient, 1985 directive relates to uncultivated land, and doing things
to it to make it cultivated, as well as to restructuring projects.
Nothing in the European legislation defines either &#147;uncultivated
land&#148; or &#147;restructuring projects&#148;. Therefore, some
time ago&#151;I think it was in 2001&#151;the Government introduced
an uncultivated land provision by way of statutory instrument and laid
down a threshold of two hectares. If you carry out operations on that
land, you are in for trouble. There was an instance of somebody who
spread lime on an environmentally sensitive piece of grassland in York
and was heavily fined for doing so. There is no threshold that I know
of in any other European country which is the equivalent of two
hectares.</p><p><a name="06102652000588"></a>Then, quite apart
from that, the statutory instrument examined in the latest Merits
Committee report introduces the restructuring programme. Nobody knows
what &#147;restructuring&#148; means. Nobody knows what area it
relates to, and Defra has made up the rules&#151;they may be very
sensible. They relate to the things that &#147;restructuring&#148;
may convey. However, all I can tell your Lordships is that our rules
are seriously different in extent from those in Ireland, Belgium and
the Netherlands. It is therefore no use saying that, because the
offences are not specified, we are liable to get into trouble by not
conforming to what is happening in the rest of the European
Union&#151;we are already doing
so.</p><p><a name="06102652000589"></a>What is going to be done
about this? If the Minister does not like my amendment, he must first
of all assure me that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, will
be able to deal with this point, because I doubt that it is within his
terms of reference. If he is not, the Cabinet Office will have to
provide instructions to parliamentary clerks in various government
departments on how to draft regulations. They are going to have to pay
attention to what the Joint Committee said five or six years ago. If
they do not, we will not be sticking to the precepts that underline
this Bill&#151;transparency, and the removal of sanctions. This is an
occasion when we must really emphasise that government departments
should pay attention to this problem. It is no use leaving it on the
basis that you can look it all up on the internet or find some other
method of dealing with it.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1379"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000590"></a>The other thing that the Joint Committee
said was, &#147;Oh, well, it&#146;s always covered by
guidance&#148;. So it is, but guidance does not do any good in a
criminal court, nor does a criminal court have access to the guidance.
Indeed, I do not think that the criminal court has access to the
European legislation either. When I used to sit at Harrow, there was no
indication in the library of the official journal in which one could
look all those things up, and I very much doubt whether it would have
been readily obtainable by me as a judge. Goodness knows what is going
to happen to the clerks to magistrates&#146; courts when they are
confronted with this&#151;because that is where the majority of the
cases are going to
go.</p><p><a name="06102652000591"></a>There
are provisions which apply the prohibitions with a sanction that
includes prison. I very much trust that that is not the course that
will be taken. Fines are much more likely to be effective.
Nevertheless, somebody has to impose the fine and find out what offence
is alleged to have been committed. So ought people be able to find out
what the offence is before they decide whether they are going to commit
it. That is one of the basic principles of criminal law in this
country. I beg to move.</p><h5><a name="06102652000870"></a>5.30

that, having served with him on the Merits of Statutory Instruments
Committee, I had always been immensely impressed by the amount of work
that he put in to trace the roots of every instrument that came before
that committee. It took a formidable amount of work and his kind of

that.</p><p><a name="06102652000593"></a>I do not know what my
noble friend is going to say about the amendment, but there is a
general point to be made and somebody somewhere ought to look after
this matter. When these regulations or orders are published they should
contain a succinct summary of all the previous relevant orders and
where people can find them. I hope that the Government will also make
available an electronic dictionary so that, at the touch of a button,
anyone can trace all the 25 or 27 previous items involved in such
legislation. That should not be difficult to do. From what the noble
Viscount has said, I am convinced that lots of small businessmen,
farmers and ordinary people are harassed by such regulations, so we
should do whatever we can. What could apply under Clause 1(3)(b), (c)
and (d) supports the amendment. I hope that somewhere in the system
there is a positive response to what the noble Viscount has

Kingsland:</b> My Lords, that slightly complicates
what I intended to say. The report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Davidson, is about gold-plating, which is a function of directives, not
regulations. As I understand it, regulations are instruments that, when
issued on a certain date by the European Community, are required
henceforth to be obeyed in each one of the member states. Directives,
by contrast, are given typically 18 months or two years before
implementation has to take place, and thereafter the member Government
are not obliged to implement the directive word for word, as long as
they reconstitute the objective behind the directive in their national
regulations. In so far as the noble Viscount is talking about
regulations, it seems to me that the committee of the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Davidson, is entirely inappropriate to deal with the
matter.</p><p><a name="06102652000597"></a>Regulations are not
supposed to be amplified or altered in any way by a member state once
made by the European Community; but, in the context of what the noble
Viscount has been saying, we are in difficulty with regulations that
subsequently become the subject of national criminal law. That goes to
the heart of the point he is trying to make. The European Community has
no authority over the making or implementation of criminal
law.</p><p><a name="06102652000598"></a>We are
in particular difficulties over this point in relation to Article 7 of
the European Convention on Human Rights. That article requires the
definition of any criminal offence to be sufficiently specific that an
individual can assess whether the activity he is about to enter into is
capable of constituting a criminal act. As the noble Viscount pointed
out, regulations are drafted in many different languages, and they do
not define the particular legislative target in a way that fits in with
our criminal law&#151;or, in particular, our criminal evidence
system&#151;at all. On the Continent, they have the inquisitorial
approach to crime: no juries, judges with immense power to investigate
the background as well as the specifics of the alleged offence, and
burdens and standards of proof that sometimes differ dramatically from
our own. It is almost impossible to discern, in a regulation that is
intended subsequently to be applied by the criminal law, the
traditional approaches of our courts even to such fundamental
distinctions as <I>mens rea</I> and <I>actus reus</I>.</p><p><a name="06102652000599"></a>Both for Article 7 reasons, and because
the Continental systems are so different from our own, in my judgment
there is a really compelling case here to follow the line suggested by
the noble Viscount. Of course, as he rightly says, one of the ways
Governments escape from amendments tabled by your Lordships&#146;
House is to look at the detail of the amendment and explain why the
detail is not quite right, thus avoiding having to confront the
principle. However, what matters here is not the detail but the
principle. We want to know from the Government whether they accept that
principle. I am sure we are going to hear from the Minister why the
particular detail that the noble Viscount has set out does not quite
fit the bill.</p>

good and bad practice which he brought to our attention in Committee
and again today. I readily acknowledge that we did not seek to answer

the Government take this matter seriously and that there is an
effective way forward.</p><p><a name="06102652000602"></a>The
purpose and effect of Amendment No. 36 are very similar to those of the
amendment that the noble Viscount tabled in Committee. As he explained
then, the amendment would make it possible to tell, by reading UK
legislation alone, without the need to cross-refer to the relevant
Community legislation, what one is obliged to do and what one must not
do to avoid committing a criminal offence. He said that this was a
question of transparency and reducing the burden for those who have to
deal with statutory instruments that transpose European Community
obligations into domestic law. These are issues which the Government
take extremely
seriously.</p><p><a name="06102652000603"></a>The
Government agree with the intention behind the noble Viscount&#146;s
amendment and that every effort should be made to ensure that European
Community obligations are transposed into domestic law in a way that is
transparent and reduces the burden on those dealing with them. He was
also right in saying that Defra tries to address that by including in
some statutory instruments a schedule to explain those provisions in
the relevant European directive that, should they be breached, will
amount to an offence under domestic law. The two examples of SI
2006/1970 on sea fisheries and 2005/3522 on the disposal of older
cattle were cited by the noble Viscount in Committee and again today.
He also referred to those instruments as examples of good
practice.</p><p><a name="06102652000604"></a>The
Government will continue to seek ways to ensure that all statutory
instruments that transpose European Community obligations into domestic
law are drafted in a manner that is clear, simple and transparent.
Although I agree with the intention of the noble Viscount&#146;s
amendment, as he has anticipated we cannot support it today. Current
drafting guidance does not explicitly state whether a description of an
offence should be included in an SI used to transpose a European
Community obligation, or how detailed any such description should be.
Instead, departments are given the flexibility to decide on a
case-by-case basis how best to draft an SI that transposes a Community
obligation. Amendment No. 36 would remove this flexibility by requiring
all subordinate legislation used to transpose European Community
obligations into domestic law to include a description of any activity
which, if carried out, would constitute a criminal offence.</p>

36, I can assure the noble Viscount that the Government will consider
the points that he has made today. Clearly, one route is through the
guidance given to departmental lawyers who draft the implementing
Community obligations, which seems an appropriate way of encouraging
best practice. We will certainly look at that to see how it might be
strengthened to address the point that the noble Viscount
made.</p><p><a name="06102652000606"></a>There
was some discussion about the committee of the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Davidson. It is right, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said,
that it focuses primarily on gold-plating issues, which are about
directives and not regulations. However, the review is about
considering the implementation of EU legislation, and we will ensure
that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, who is undertaking the
review of implementation of European Union legislation, receives for
his consideration copies of <I>Hansard</I> for the debates today and in
Committee, as well as the examples of best practice that the noble
Viscount provided. We will also seek to facilitate his own direct
engagement with that process, if he so wishes. I hope that, in that
manner, we can move the issue
forward.</p><h5><a name="06102652000871"></a>5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000607"></a>I hope that
the noble Viscount will accept that the Government are committed to
finding means of transposing European Community obligations into
domestic law in a way that is transparent and reduces the burden on
those required to comply with European Union directives. For example,
they are exploring the possibility of making consolidated versions of
statutory instruments used to implement Community obligations into
domestic law publicly available. The Davidson review has taken note of
these representations. It is likely that the review will recommend that
consolidated versions of statutory instruments should be made publicly
available. The Government also stated in their response to the Merits
of Statutory Instruments Committee&#146;s 29th Report of Session
2005-2006 that they will dedicate resources to formally and
&#147;informally&#148;&#151;that is, without making a new
instrument&#151;consolidating statutory instruments where
departmental Ministers can identify appropriate cases. This intention
is consistent with the Government&#146;s simplification programme,
which requires departments to consider whether they can reduce the
regulatory burdens which fall on business, the voluntary sector and
front-line public servants by providing greater clarity on the content
or interpretation of
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102652000608"></a>I
am conscious that my response has not provided a precise way of dealing
specifically with the important point that the noble Viscount has again
raised, but I hope that, through the mechanisms and processes that I
have mentioned, there is a way forward and that we can achieve the
objective he so rightly pursues. On that basis I hope that he will
withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000609"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew160"></a><a name="06102652001469"></a>Viscount

Lords, Lord Desai and Lord Kingsland, for their support. It does not
matter whether it is a regulation or a directive, the trouble in the
transposition arises in exactly the same way. In neither case does the
parliamentary Clerk&#151;or not usually&#151;put into the British
statutory instrument anything which says what the offence is. I am very
glad that I was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on Article
7 of the European convention. I believe that that is at the heart of
the matter. It is not right that people should not be able to
discover&#151;or at any rate without the most colossal
trouble&#151;what they are not allowed to do, which is subject to
criminal sanctions. It certainly is not
transparent.</p><p><a name="06102652000611"></a>I will happily talk
to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, about this. If he is
concerned only with directives, we will have to deal with that, but it
does not matter very much, as this involves both sorts of European
instruments are involved. I hope that these two short debates will
ensure that somebody in the Cabinet Office will tell parliamentary
Clerks that there is good practice. I have given two examples of it,
and the noble Lord has acknowledged that. I tried to do that in
Committee but it was brushed aside as being perfectly hopeless,
airy-fairy and nothing other than confusing. However, that does not
seem to be the case, as sometimes, but by no means always,
parliamentary Clerks continue to put summaries of the offence in
schedules. Why can&#146;t we have a new instruction across the board
that that should always be done? Then someone has, at any rate, the
beginning of an idea where to look for the actions that they must avoid
if they are not to get into trouble. If that is what the noble Lord is
telling me he will set afoot, I will not return to the matter. However,
I promise him that the reports of the Merits of Statutory Instruments
Committee will continue to look at this. It has not gone away and there
is no sign whatever of it improving as a result of anything that has
been said.</p><p><a name="06102652000612"></a>Please, look again at
what the Joint Committee said in 2001 and see whether something can be
done about it. The noble Lord nods his head and I am sure that he will
probably get something done. I hope that he may communicate with me a
little further before Third Reading next week&#151;it is also on a
Thursday, so I shall be in the same trouble as I am

COMMUNITY OBLIGATIONS</ul><ul><a name="06102652000795"></a>(1)
Subordinate legislation implementing any Community obligation of the
United Kingdom, or enabling such obligation to be implemented, or
enabling any rights to be enjoyed or to be enjoyed by the United
Kingdom under or by virtue of the treaties may not impose or increase
any burden on any person which is not necessary to implement the
Community obligation or right.</ul><ul><a name="06102652000796"></a>(2) In this section-</ul>
&#147;burden&#148; has the same meaning as
in section 1(3);
&#147;subordinate legislation&#148; has the
same meaning as in section 27(9)(b);
&#147;the treaties&#148; has the same
meaning as in section 1(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68)
(short title and
interpretation).&#148;<p><a name="06102652000617"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I emphasise at the outset that this
amendment is not about the content of the directives themselves. They
raise a range of issues that are of great importance but form no part
of this matter. The Cassis de Dijon case, decided in the late 1980s,
and the White Paper of the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, which came a few
years later, got the Community off to a good start in pursuing its
objective of a single market. I think your Lordships will agree that,
since then, the results have been like the curate&#146;s egg. I am in
no doubt that it will not be long before one or other of your Lordships
will again be drawing to our attention matters about the contents of
the directives.</p><p><a name="06102652000618"></a>The noble and
learned Lord, Lord Davidson, has been conducting an inquiry about
gold-plating, the background to the issue that this amendment attempts
to raise; and we applaud that. It is somewhat surprising that it has
taken the Government nine and a half years to get down to studying this
issue, because concerns about gold-plating have been expressed at least
since the mid or late 1980s; and, to be fair to the Government, my own
party did not address this issue when it was in
Government.</p><p><a name="06102652000619"></a>I hope that I will
be forgiven for being uncharacteristically cynical in seeking a reason
for the reluctance of both Governments to look at the issue. Community
legislation gets on to the statute book very easily in this country
because directives are introduced through Section 2 of the European
Communities Act 1972; that section requires only an Order in Council
for the legislation to be made. None of the legislation goes through
the elaborate process that primary legislation has to go through in
your Lordships&#146; House and another
place.</p><p><a name="06102652000620"></a>The framework for
everything that has been done in the world of Community directives
starts with essentially unscrutinised legislation; and that breeds a
morass of regulation that is equally unscrutinised, because the only
thing that your Lordships' House and another place can do is to adopt
it or refuse it, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. This is very
attractive to officials and Ministers for obvious reasons: partly
because they are not obliged to defend their case against the
Opposition in Parliament, and partly because they can make wide-ranging
decisions about how the British economy should work, without having to
clutter up the annual demands for primary 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1385"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation or queue for it. So we get a disproportionately large amount
of Community legislation on the statute book because it is very easy to
get it there. The other reason is that civil servants&#151;in many
cases, no doubt, for very good reasons&#151;have been aching to get
matters on to the statute book for years and years but have never
succeeded in the annual bid for primary legislation. So they tend to
add on to a directive a whole range of purely domestic matters for
which they could find no happy legislative home at an earlier
stage.</p><p><a name="06102652000621"></a>I commend the Government
on having had the courage at last to come out of the closet on this
issue and on inviting the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, to
look at it, in a sense, at a stage removed from Government and to come
up with some sensible answers. We applaud the establishment of the
Davidson committee, but we feel that we are entitled to ask the
Government: why nine and a half years? After all, their task force has
been going for almost the same length of time as the Government. If
they were so enthusiastic about deregulation, one would have thought
that they would have confronted the issue of gold-plating head-on
earlier. However, we are all looking forward, as I suppose the
Government are, to the noble and learned Lord&#146;s
conclusions.</p><p><a name="06102652000622"></a>As I understand it, one
technique used by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, in his
investigation is to talk to government departments and non-governmental
agencies in other member states, which are recognised as having a
lighter regulatory touch than ours, to see whether a similar approach
would be acceptable in the UK. If that is what the noble and learned
Lord has, in fact, done, I find that enormously refreshing. First, by
doing so, the Government&#151;or, at least, the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Davidson&#151;are accepting that some other nation states
apply a lighter touch than us. That, in itself, is good reason for
conducting his investigation. But I very much hope that in his report
he will give a full account of the work done in this area.</p><p><a name="06102652000623"></a>From what has appeared so far on the
noble and learned Lord&#146;s website, the questions that he is
asking seem pertinent and, in some cases, rather penetrating. His
general approach is to ensure that, in future, UK business will not be
disadvantaged when competing with businesses in other euro states
because of regulatory burdens. I believe that that principle lies
behind his investigation. I think that he focuses particularly on
whether the implementing measures widen the scope of the original
directives. That is a very important area of investigation. You might
argue that a directive needs to be elaborated in a certain way because
we have law in this country that does not derive from the Community but
presents a problem for implementation in exactly the way that the
directive suggests. However, I do not think that there is any case for
domestic legislation to widen the scope of a directive. That goes to my
earlier point about some departments using Community directives to get
in purely domestic issues for which they cannot find a primary
legislative home.</p><p><a name="06102652000624"></a>There are one or two
other matters that the noble and learned Lord wisely included in his
terms of 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1386"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reference. He asks, for example, whether the UK is really taking full
advantage of any derogations in the EU measure, and if not, why not.
There are wide-ranging derogations in directives simply because member
states negotiate hard, and one of the ways for the Community to end up
legislating is by making concessions to such member states. They are
not described as concessions to Lithuania, the UK or France; they
appear on the face of the directive as derogations&#151;sensible
conclusions that all 25 states, or however many there are in the
European Community these days, agree with.</p><h5><a name="06102652000872"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000625"></a>The noble and learned Lord
will also concentrate on whether enforcement mechanisms themselves, or
the sanctions imposed, go beyond the minimum necessary. That matter
will be plainly in his sights, as indeed it is in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102652000626"></a>One task that the noble
and learned Lord has given himself, which I also find most interesting,
is to look at the risks that the Government thought required a measure
of gold-plating at the outset&#151;when the directive was
implemented&#151;and to assess whether these risks today are still as
apparent and of as much concern as they were then. I think that he will
ask government departments to address the issue with great
particularity.</p><p><a name="06102652000627"></a>In the context of
the Bill, it seems that the noble and learned Lord&#146;s
investigation is absolutely central. That is why I tabled my amendment.
I sense that the Government will say, &#147;Well, thank you very much
for saying that the Davidson committee has been set up, but,
unfortunately, we will not know what it says until long after the Bill
leaves your Lordships&#146; House. Of course, we cannot be absolutely
certain that his conclusions will comply with the absolutist tone of
your directive. Therefore, let&#146;s wait and see what the noble and
learned Lord says, and the issue can then be addressed on some
subsequent occasion&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102652000628"></a>I
shall be very interested to hear what the Minister says in reply. I
might be quick-footed enough, if I think there is some weight in what
the Government say, to change my amendment before Third Reading, but I
am not inclined to let this go if the Government turn me down at this
stage. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000629"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew164"></a><a name="06102652001473"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Kingsland, for moving his amendment, and for commending the
Government for their efforts. I hesitate to nit-pick, but I think that
the review by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, was initiated
in the Pre-Budget Report in 2005. It is eight and a half rather than
nine and a half years. The review is part of a wider range of things in
train, which demonstrates that the Government are serious about this
and about avoiding
gold-plating.</p><p><a name="06102652000630"></a>It is probably a
little unfair to suggest that legislation derived from the EU is not
subject to scrutiny. The Section 2(2) approach is usually used to make
regulations that are subject to either the negative or the affirmative
resolution procedure. Of course, EC legislation is carefully
scrutinised by the European Parliament as well, so it is not as though
there is no scrutiny at all.</p>

points. I did not mention the European Parliament because I supposed
that it might be said that I perhaps had a conflict of interest, having
once sat in it. On the negative or affirmative resolution, I think that
I said in my speech that that, indeed, happened but, of course, we have
no opportunity to amend on this occasion.</p><p><a name="06102652000632"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew166"></a><a name="06102652001475"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, the purpose of this
amendment appears to be to introduce a legislative barrier to
gold-plating European Community obligations when they are transposed
into domestic law through secondary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102652000633"></a>As
the Government have stated throughout the debate on this Bill, we take
the issue of gold-plating and the over-implementation of European
Community obligations extremely seriously, and we are taking action to
deal with the concerns of business on that. The review that the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Davidson of Glen Clova, is conducting for the
Government, for instance, is specifically aimed at identifying examples
where it is clear that Community obligations have been
over-implemented. Where necessary, the review will consider ways of
reducing the regulatory burdens imposed on business by the existing
stock of legislation implementing Community obligations. I presume that
the noble Lord has seen a copy of the interim report of the review,
which gives an update on progress. The hope is that the report will now
be concluded quite quickly.</p><p><a name="06102652000634"></a>It has always been the
Government&#146;s policy to implement European Community obligations
so as to achieve the objectives of the obligation without
over-implementation. The Cabinet Office guidance on the transposition
of European directives makes it explicitly clear that only in certain
exceptional circumstances and where it is justified by a robust
cost/benefit analysis and extensive consultation with stakeholders
should departments consider implementation that goes beyond the minimum
required by a European directive. The guidance also makes it clear that
all decisions to implement beyond the minimum required by a European
directive must be made
public.</p><p><a name="06102652000635"></a>The effect of the
amendment would be to preclude any discretion on the part of any
Government in the transposition of EC obligations into domestic law by
statutory instrument. Is the intention of the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, really to further limit the discretion of any UK Government
to implement Community obligations in a way that best suits the
particular circumstances of the UK? I cannot believe that that is his
aim.</p><p><a name="06102652000636"></a>The
interim report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, provides a
number of specific examples where the noble Lord&#146;s proposed
amendment would have precluded the Government from acting in the
UK&#146;s best interests. The evidence demonstrates that, by
implementing European Community obligations in a way that goes beyond
the minimum required by a European directive, the Government can ensure
that directives are implemented in line with domestic legislation, meet
the UK&#146;s higher standards and reflect the specific requirements
of the UK.</p>



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1388"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102652000637"></a>For example, when
transposing the temporary work at height directive, the Government
extended the scope so that it applied to the self-employed in domestic
legislation&#151;something I hope that we all support. By extending
the scope of this directive, the Government ensured that it maintained
the UK&#146;s higher standards, in line with the provisions of the
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which pre-dated the EC
legislation by 17 years. This ensures equal protection for those who
might be injured by people working at heights, regardless of whether
the person is self-employed or an employee, and prevents unscrupulous
contractors from escaping their health and safety duties by claiming
that their employees are self-employed. Were this amendment on the
statute books when the directive was transposed into domestic
legislation, the Government would have had to accept the lower
standards of health and safety set by the EC. This would also have
caused unnecessary confusion and inconsistency between similar
businesses.</p><p><a name="06102652000638"></a>A further example is
the 2003 prospectus directive. In this case, representatives of the
financial services industry commented that this was an example where
the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority had engaged with
stakeholders early on and, on industry advice, had taken sensible
decisions to maintain higher UK standards than the EC directive
prescribed so as to provide higher consumer protection and financial
stability. The UK financial markets are the leading markets in the EU
and, therefore, changing their regulatory practices to tie in with
rules appropriate to less advanced markets may have undermined the
UK&#146;s position.</p><p><a name="06102652000639"></a>The
amendment would present further problems when transposing Community
obligations into domestic law. It would require that, in implementing a
Community obligation, the Government do not impose or increase any
burden that is,</p><ul><a name="06102652000827"></a>&#147;not
necessary to implement the Community obligation or
right&#148;.</ul><a name="06102652000726"></a>However, it
is often impossible to tell, or at least to agree, the bare minimum
necessary to implement a Community obligation. The wording of EU
directives is sometimes vague and the Government have to make a
risk-based judgment about how the European Court of Justice might
interpret the wording in question. This amendment would handicap the
Government in their attempts to do that and would be likely to lead to
numerous challenges in the UK courts by bodies asserting that the
Government were going further than necessary. Ultimately, that would
use up time and resources and place UK courts in the very difficult
position of having to try to second-guess what the European Court of
Justice might rule.<p><a name="06102652000640"></a>I suggest
that the provisions in the Bill are, in fact, better placed to respond
effectively and pragmatically to the issues of gold-plating and
over-implementation than the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. That is
because Clause 1 can be used to remove or reduce a burden, which could,
in principle, include removing or reducing a burden resulting from
implementation of an EC directive that goes beyond the minimum
required. Furthermore, the provisions of Clause 20 make it possible to
combine an order made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities
Act 1972 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1389"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with an order made under the Bill to remove or reduce burdens. That will
enable a single order to implement Community law under Section 2(2) of
the ECA and remove pre-existing domestic statutory provisions that have
been superseded by Community law using the power in Clause 1. That will
help to reduce occurrences of
double-banking.</p><p><a name="06102652000641"></a>Given the
undesirable restrictions that this amendment would impose, I urge the
noble Lord to withdraw
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000642"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew167"></a><a name="06102652001476"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I am obliged to the Minister
for his reply. For reasons beyond the control of both of us, this
amendment was not discussed in Committee, so before we conclude this
debate I would like to ask him one or two more questions. However, I
shall first comment on his contribution. It was extremely full and he
obviously took a great deal of trouble over it. I thank him for
that.</p><p><a name="06102652000643"></a>I was a bit puzzled by
the Minister&#146;s remark about the European Court of Justice and
the uncertainty that a court might experience when making a decision in
the context of my amendment. Whether a directive is implemented in
terms or elaborated by the national legislature, an English court is in
entirely the same position in relation to a matter of interpretation.
Even if a directive has been implemented in national law, the ultimate
arbiter of what that law means will be the European Court of Justice.
Since we have been a member of the Community, there have been countless
occasions when a matter at issue in a dispute over a British statute
that derives from a Community directive has been referred by the
British court to the ECJ. Therefore, in my respectful submission, the
distinction that the Minister makes in that part of his argument is a
distinction without a
difference.</p><p><a name="06102652000644"></a>One of the
illustrations to which the Minister drew your Lordships&#146;
attention was social legislation. However, it has always been accepted
in the social sector in the Community that a directive provides a
minimum series of social standards, not an exclusive series. At no
stage has there been an obligation on the UK Government to accept the
minimum necessary, and I do not see my amendment covering circumstances
such as
that.</p><h5><a name="06102652000873"></a>6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06102652000645"></a>The one reassuring point that
the Minister makes&#151;and this is the one point that gives me pause
for thought about the absolutism of my amendment&#151;was his
reference to what I think is called the Cabinet Office transposition
guide. The noble Lord nods his head. I am not sure whether it is
because of my own negligence or the fact that this document is not
easily available that I have not seen it; it is probably the former.
But I was very interested to hear what the Minister said about it
because it suggests that if what is contained in the transposition
document is widely applied by departments, then gold-plating ought not
to be a problem. These are very strict requirements in the
document.</p><p><a name="06102652000646"></a>Can the Minister tell
us a bit more about the document, its degree of transparency, the
frequency

Secretaries of State and, in particular, Permanent Secretaries in
departments? How thoroughly are regulations supervised by Permanent
Secretaries to ensure that the Cabinet document to which the Minister
referred is actually complied with? The way he described the document
suggests that it ought to be extremely difficult to gold-plate any
Community directive.</p><p><a name="06102652000647"></a>The
Minister may feel that at this stage he cannot answer these
questions&#151;I do not know. I apologise to him for putting him to
the trouble of having to stand up another time. When I drafted the
amendment I had not really addressed this area, so this is a genuine
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06102652000648"></a><b><a name="61026-0005.htm_spnew168"></a><a name="06102652001477"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord for those questions. I will try to answer them as best I can. The
guidance is a document which changes from time to time to deal with
changing circumstances. Indeed, in our earlier debate we touched on how
it might be used as the mechanism to deal with the point raised by the
noble Viscount, Lord Colville.</p><p><a name="06102652000649"></a>Part of that guidance requires the
regulatory impact assessment to be produced when transposition takes
place. That sets out the analysis that must be undertaken. The guidance
is on the Cabinet Office website; all departments are aware of it; it
is updated regularly; and it is expected that it would be complied
with. If the noble Lord is unable to access it readily, perhaps he will
let me know and I should be happy to provide him with a copy and the
documentation that surrounds
it.</p><p><a name="06102652000650"></a>On the European Court of
Justice, under the proposed amendment legislation cannot be introduced
in the UK that is not absolutely necessary to implement a Community
obligation or right. If, under the drafting of that Community
obligation or right, there is uncertainty about what it might mean,
when it is transposed into UK legislation there would be a
risk&#151;would there not?&#151;that somebody could come along and
say that this is doing more than is absolutely necessary. Therefore,
there is another area for contention about how that legislation is
introduced. I think that that is the key point.</p><p><a name="06102652000651"></a>We read the amendment
as precluding dealing with social aspects of legislation. It seemed to
me to be an absolute issue&#151;that you should not do anything that
was not absolutely necessary to implement the Community obligation. One
would think that that would mean that, other things being equal, if
there were a range of dates for its implementation you would have to
introduce it at the latest period that you possibly could because it
would be doing more than was necessary to do so earlier&#151;for
example, where you would have to take advantage of all the derogations.
How would that impact on what is proposed?</p><p><a name="06102652000652"></a>The issue of timing and some of these
points are touched upon in the interim report of my noble and learned
friend Lord Davidson. That might be worth a review. I hope that I have
dealt with the key points the noble Lord has raised. If not, I will try
again.</p>

Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I do not propose to return
to the question of the interpretation of the European Court of Justice
or of social legislation. Suffice it to say that, if social legislation
deriving from purely domestic measures sets higher standards than those
in the directive, my amendment would not affect those social rules,
which derive from purely domestic legislation. It would therefore in no
way inhibit the United Kingdom from having higher standards than those
in the directive.</p><p><a name="06102652000654"></a>I quite take
the point about the possibility of measures for a directive that go
wider than the terms of the directive widening the risk of references
to the European Court of Justice. However, when we are talking about
domestic rules&#151;purely community regulations rather than the
directives themselves, because the directives must always be
implemented in some form&#151;I was concerned to underline the
principle of the last word on the interpretation of a directive or
directive-derived legislation always being with the European Court of
Justice.</p><p><a name="06102652000655"></a>I am
most grateful to the Minister. I have found these exchanges very
useful, both because the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, will
not report until long after the Bill is put to bed and because the
Minister has given me an idea or two in the context of the Cabinet
guidance. I shall not return at Third Reading with this amendment, but
I might return with a more nuanced attempt to have some reference to
this very important subject put into the Bill. Meanwhile, I beg to ask

shall be briefer than I was when I moved my previous amendment. All I
want to do is to ask two questions. First, why is there a reference to
the Church of England in the Bill? Why is it specifically excluded from
the definition of functions? Secondly, if it is to be excluded, why
does that not extend to other religious bodies? I beg to

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the reference to
the Church of England in the Bill was inserted in recognition of its
particular constitutional position, rather than because it was a
religious institution or organisation. The noble Lord may not have been
present when I moved the relevant amendment in 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1392"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 1392</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee; I cannot recall. The long-standing convention is that the
Government will not legislate on anything within the competence of the
Church of England, which has <I>de facto</I> delegated power, without
the agreement of the
Church.</p><p><a name="06102652000664"></a>Such
agreement takes different forms depending on the circumstances.
Concerns were expressed about the ability to use the order-making
powers in the Bill to legislate in a way that affected the
Church&#146;s functions without having to obtain its consent. The
Government took these concerns to heart and proposed an amendment to
Clause 32, which was approved by your Lordships&#146; House. The
clause was amended to fulfil the Government&#146;s obligation under
the convention, and ensures that the powers under Clause 2 and Part 2
will not apply to the regulatory activities of bishops, church courts
and disciplinary tribunals or to the legislative role of the General
Synod, where it passes legislation that has a regulatory
effect.</p><p><a name="06102652000665"></a>The
noble Lord&#146;s amendment raises other issues and, despite the
reasonable intentions behind it, we cannot agree that it should be
included. The Church of England has a unique constitutional position
with Parliament and the passing of legislation in relation to it. Other
religious organisations in the UK do not have similar standing and
there is no precedent for treating these organisations in the same way,
which probably answers both questions posed by the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06102652000666"></a>Whether this position in
relation to religious organisations is correct or wrong in principle
is, I would argue, not the subject of this Bill. For the purpose of
ensuring that the Bill remains focused on better regulation, I would
also say that it is not a subject for this House today. Perhaps I
should also point out that the amendment does not attempt to define a
religious organisation, so perhaps it does not fall into that trap.
There is no agreed definition of the term in English law. If the
amendment were agreed, there would of course be a whole host of
arguments about whether a particular body fell within the terms of the
definition. The noble Lord could stir up something of a hornets&#146;
nest if he wanted to. I hope that that satisfies the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06102652000667"></a><b><a name="61026-0006.htm_spnew173"></a><a name="06102652001482"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I was well aware that
if we got into the detail a hornets&#146; nest may well buzz around
our heads. The Minister may be interested to know that this amendment
was suggested by the Christian lawyers association, which I have no
doubt whatever will read his response with great interest. In the mean
time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="06102652000668"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Any standing orders that the Government wish to implement immediately
will have only one month of sitting parliamentary time to be debated
and agreed. Clearly, that is not enough time for effective
scrutiny.</p><p><a name="06102652000672"></a>I
understand that the Government do not intend to make any orders until
March 2007, which would allow the Procedure Committee enough time to
finish its work and for Parliament to consider the orders to be agreed
on. However, if no orders are to be made until March, why will the Bill
come into force so long before? Surely it would be more sensible for
the Bill&#146;s commencement date to be delayed until all the loose
ends are tied up, which would also give us some much-needed reassurance
that the Government intend to implement this legislation in a
considered manner after it has been properly scrutinised. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102652000673"></a><b><a name="61026-0006.htm_spnew175"></a><a name="06102652001484"></a>Lord

of her. It saddens me greatly that we have now reached the last
amendment and are hearing from her only for the second time.</p><p><a name="06102652000674"></a>The noble Baroness of course makes a
valid argument. I understand the concern that the time available for
parliamentary committees to consider revising orders perhaps is not as
she would wish. Obviously, we want to ensure that we have in place a
good working system for scrutinising orders when new orders are put to
committees under the Bill. We agree that engaging parliamentary
committees on revisions to standing orders is essential to that
process. But I come back to the point that the amendment seeks only to
delay the Bill, which is unnecessary, because that work can
continue.</p><p><a name="06102652000675"></a>We have said here and
in another place that we want to work with committees to ensure that
amendments to standing orders are in place, and we have delivered on
that commitment. Throughout the passage of the Bill through Parliament,
we have provided relevant committees of both Houses with opportunities
to consider and share their views on those amendments. Working drafts
of the new orders informed by continuing discussions have been shared
with the committee chairs, and official drafts will be issued in time
for Third Reading. The progress on this dialogue to date indicates that
a formal extension of the Bill is not
necessary.</p><p><a name="06102652000676"></a>I give a commitment
that we will continue to work with committees to ensure that they are
aware of the timetable for laying orders and have sufficient warning of
any approaching work. We think there

able to inform the House that we have decided to exempt payments made
in respect of asbestos-related diseases by subsidiaries of Federal
Mogul from the department's compensation recovery
scheme.</p><p><a name="06102657000021"></a>The compensation
recovery scheme is aimed at ensuring that injured parties are not
compensated twice&#151;once through the compensation payment they
receive from the employer or insurer and again through the benefits
system. The scheme also helps to ensure that compensators fulfil their
own obligations and are not subsidised by the taxpayer. Benefit paid
out for the same accident, injury or disease for which the compensation
is being made is normally recovered from the compensator by the
Department for Work and
Pensions.</p><p><a name="06102657000022"></a>Federal Mogul has
become insolvent under the United States of America's insolvency
legislation. As a result of this it is not in a position to meet in
full its liabilities to its employees arising from asbestos-related
diseases. A trust fund has been set up to meet part of these
liabilities. However, employees are likely to receive only around 20
pence of every &#163;1 they are due. The unprecedented step to exempt
this particular trust recognises the unique position in which former
employees of Federal Mogul's UK subsidiaries (Turner &amp; Newall and
associated companies) have found
themselves.</p><p><a name="06102657000023"></a>Exempting
the trust from the normal compensation recovery rules means that more
money will be available to meet the needs of the victims and their
families who have been affected by these diseases. All the funds in the
trust will be available for compensation payments on top of benefits
paid&#151;we feel it is important to ensure that their already
reduced compensation payments are not reduced further. The cost to the
Government is estimated to be &#163;10 million over the next three
years. These are unique circumstances which do not undermine the
general principles of the compensation recovery scheme. We will bring

Disclosure: Transparency Obligations
Directive</h3><p><a name="06102657000024"></a><b><a name="61026-wms0001.htm_spnew182"></a><a name="06102657000039"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My honourable friend the
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following
Written Statement.</p><p><a name="06102657000025"></a>The Treasury
has been working closely with the DTI and industry in developing a
regime dealing with liability in damages for damage suffered by
reliance on certain financial disclosures to be made under FSA
disclosure rules implementing the Transparency Obligations Directive
(2004/109/EC).</p><p><a name="06102657000026"></a>After
the Government's decision to establish a statutory regime for liability
in damages to third parties in respect of disclosures under the
transparency directive, industry made representations to the Government
that the establishment of this regime, added to other developments in
law and regulation, could have serious and unwanted repercussions for
issuer liability for disclosures made other than under the transparency
directive (for example, in response to the FSA disclosure rules). The
Government therefore consulted with key stakeholders over the summer.
Responses confirmed that, while an extension of the statutory regime
was in principle desirable, this is an extremely complex area in which
it is vital that the Government get their policy
right.</p><p><a name="06102657000027"></a>The
consultation and government response to this consultation can be found
at the following web address:
www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/documents/financial_ services/eu financial
services/fin_eufs_trans.cfm.</p><p><a name="06102657000028"></a>Following
this consultation, amendments have been made at the Report stage of the
Companies Bill (passed by the Commons and now in front of the Lords) to
have the following
effect:</p>extend the scope of the
statutory liability regime for financial disclosures to preliminary
announcements of the results covered by the existing provision in the
Bill;clarify the liability of company
directors and other senior officers;change
the territorial coverage of the regime to ensure that the liability
regime covers all issuers for which the UK is home member state as well
those issuers for which the UK is not home member state but whose
securities are traded on a regulated market situated or operating in
the UK; and 



<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS122"></a><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column WS122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide a power in the Companies Bill to enable the
Treasury, by secondary legislation subject to the affirmative
procedure, to make further provision with regard to the liability of
issuers of securities admitted to trading on regulated markets in
respect of reports and information issued to shareholders and to those
markets.<p><a name="06102657000029"></a>In relation to the
last provision, it will be important for the Government to be able to
act quickly to resolve uncertainties in the law relating to the
liability in damages of issuers if this is found to be required. For
this reason, the Bill, as passed by the House of Commons, gives the
Government the power to make further provision about liability for
published information. In view of the significance of these proposals
for the future of financial markets in the UK and the breadth of the
power proposed, the affirmative procedure has been
chosen.</p><p><a name="06102657000030"></a>To
inform the Government's decision on the further changes to the law for
issuer liability, if any, are required, the Government have decided to
conduct a formal review of the liability of issuers in respect of
damage or loss suffered as a consequence of inaccurate, false or
misleading information disclosed by issuers or their managements to
financial markets (including to their own shareholders or bondholders)
or of failure to disclose relevant information promptly or at all. This
will take into account both existing regulatory obligations and
penalties, including criminal penalties, and the potential for
liability in damages under existing common law jurisprudence. It will
also need to look at the position in other EU member states and more
widely in the jurisdictions of other substantial financial services
markets. Professor Paul Davies QC, the Cassel Professor of Commercial
Law at the London School of Economics, has agreed to conduct this
review. Detailed terms of reference will be published
shortly.</p><p><a name="06102657000031"></a>If the review
recommends that the Government should introduce a statutory regime for
liability in damages of issuers in respect of financial disclosures or
that changes should be made to any regime that exists following the
enactment of the provisions currently in the Companies Bill the
Government will, when they publish their response to the
review:</p><p><a name="06102657000032"></a>consult fully
on the Government's response to the review's
proposals;</p><p><a name="06102657000033"></a>publish a
full regulatory impact assessment of these proposals; and,
subsequently</p><p><a name=""></a>bring forward legislation for the new
regime.</p>

lines include a passing loop to enable an improved pattern of services
on the Abbey Line and the use of station buildings at Sandown on the
Island Line for community services. A prime aim of the community rail
strategy is to reduce the need for financial support from central
government. For that reason, individual developments do not generally
depend on specific government funding. Most are self-financing, locally

The Government have already implemented the

Vehicles Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2635) and the End-of-Life Vehicles

(Lord Rooker):</b> An as yet unpublished study, which
has just been completed on behalf of Defra, estimates textile waste in
the UK at 1.1 million tonnes in 2003. This has increased and is thought
to be increasing further as sales of new clothing rise. An additional
estimated 303,000 tonnes of textiles were collected by the secondary
textiles industry (including charity shops) for reuse and recycling. Of
this, an estimated 262,000 tonnes (14 per cent) of consumption were
diverted from the UK waste stream in 2003. As part of its ongoing work
on the review of the waste strategy, Defra is considering how to
increase this figure.</p>

of household numbers and occupancy rates and the implications of

currently produced voluntarily but will become statutory under
provisions in the Water Act
