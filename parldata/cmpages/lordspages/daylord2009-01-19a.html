In addition, details of the UK-led &#147;nuclear fuel assurance&#148;, formerly known as an enrichment bond, are being finalised.</p>

Does the UK still prefer what he called the nuclear fuel assurance proposal, formerly the enrichment bond, and, if so, what are its prospects of success?</p>

My understanding is that a number of those proposals will fall to be considered by the IAEA over the next few months and certainly, we hope, by the end of the year. I endorse the noble Lord&#146;s comments about the urgency of this matter. As far as I understand, the UK&#146;s proposal is complementary to the NTI proposal. Clearly, other proposals also have to be considered, but we support the NTI proposal as well as continuing to work on the UK&#146;s proposal.</p>

We surely must winnow down these proposals. It is now five years since the Secretary-General of the UN put forward this proposal on the basis of a high-level panel and the 2010 nuclear proliferation review conference is coming down the track. There is not infinite time for it. His noble friend said in this House last week that he was less pessimistic

It is absolutely right that the 12 proposals now on the table should be considered as quickly as possible and that at the end of the day arrangements are in place under which states that wish to develop nuclear power peacefully are enabled to do so but without the proliferation of enrichment facilities. We are at one with noble Lords in our wish to see this progress. I am hopeful that discussions over the next few months will indeed enable that to take place.</p>

To that, I add the recent American indication that the new Administration would support a fissile material cut-off treaty. Does he agree that these two together&#151;the nuclear fuel bank and the fissile material cut-off treaty&#151;could bring us very close to an answer to the horrors of proliferation and nuclear weapons?</p>

As for storage in this country, the noble Lord will know that the Government have been proactive in encouraging development of potential new storage facilities.

Is he aware that 1,000 people, including children, have been hanged since August 2005 and 44 in the past month alone? Brutal punishments also include stonings to death, limb amputation without anaesthetics and eye-gouging.

That is why engaging the regime on an array of issues that go broader than just the nuclear is not, as some have feared, a strategy of appeasement but a recognition that this regime, in many facets of its behaviour, exhibits at its core that it is an authoritarian regime which brooks no criticism and seeks a military power in order for it to dominate its region.

The exchange rate plunged in 1992 when we left the ERM. For four years from then our share of world exports rose continuously. Therefore the answer to my noble friend&#146;s Question is very simple and straightforward: it is good and it is not bad. The more interesting question is: what is the likely path of the exchange rate this year? If noble Lords opposite want some free financial advice and fancy a punt, my guess is that the forward purchase of sterling over the coming year will be highly profitable.</p>

Under subsection (3), a supplemental property transfer is one that provides for property being transferred from the transferor under the initial instrument and makes any other provision that an original property instrument could make. That is set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3).</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09011910000064"></a>What happens if the original transfer tried to transfer things that cannot in fact be transferred? Problems may not generally arise under UK law, but they possibly could under foreign law&#151;for example, if the property has been confiscated under foreign law or there is some other legal obstacle to the transfer. What provision allows the original transfer instrument to be amended in those circumstances? It is not a reverse transfer under Clause 44, because no initial transfer has in fact taken place; and it does not appear to be within the scope of Clause 42, because of the wording of subsection (3), to which I referred. Perhaps the Minister can explain. I beg to move.</p>

We were somewhat uncertain about its nature, because it looked like a fairly minor drafting amendment. We do not believe that the addition of the word &#147;any&#148; changes the meaning of the clause. The current drafting already provides the law to make specific provision of any sort, so we do not think that any clarification is necessary.

The Bank of England makes supplemental property transfer instruments following the transfer of property to a private sector purchaser or bridge bank. These provide particularly valuable flexibility for property transfers. Not only do the powers provide the Bank of

For example, a further transfer of property to a bridge bank may increase the value of the bridge bank and increase the amount that a private sector purchaser is prepared to pay for the business.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09011910000068"></a>We think that there is merit in the clause as it stands. The noble Baroness mentioned the foreign law issue. Clause 35 makes clear that a property transfer instrument may seek to transfer property located outside the United Kingdom and rights and liabilities governed by foreign jurisdiction. The Government understand that such a transfer may not always be effective, and the other place recognised it as a difficulty. As there are limits to what we can guarantee in these terms, we have included Clause 39, which provides that a transferor or transferee are under obligation to take any necessary steps to make the transfer of property effective. This enhances the likelihood of a successful transfer. What happens if the transfer cannot be made under foreign law? You could use a reverse transfer for the purpose of bridging the transfer back into alignment with foreign law. A reverse transfer under domestic law would certainly be possible and we might have recourse to that.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09011910000069"></a>The noble Baroness has identified an area of difficulty which we debated in the previous Committee sitting. None of us doubts that there are difficulties with property transfer when foreign jurisdictions are involved. It is not possible for us to give absolute guarantees in every single case. What the noble Baroness can rightly expect is that the Bill is drafted in such a way that the authorities are concerned to ensure that an effective transfer takes place wherever this is possible. That is what the existing drafting of the legislation is designed to do.</p>

Amendment 78 adds two new subsections to Clause 47. This is in the difficult area of partial transfers, which is potentially one of the most significant areas of the Bill for the banking community.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09011910000072"></a>For today&#146;s Committee, these are probing amendments, but the Minister should be in no doubt that the issues underlying them are of huge significance to the banking community. I know that the Government have been working constructively with the banking industry for some time, but there is unfinished business in this area and I hope that the Minister will at least give an update on the Government&#146;s position following the completion of the consultation on the November White Paper on partial transfers. Indeed, I hope that he will be able to return to this issue generally on Report with a finally agreed solution. If the Government are unable or unwilling to do so, I shall feel obliged to return with an amendment at that stage.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09011910000073"></a>My amendment seeks to ensure that the Treasury will not allow partial transfers to alter the effect of arrangements for regulatory capital purposes. The Government made this commitment in paragraph 2.16 of the November consultation paper on the special resolution regime. Industry players have been dismayed that, despite the unequivocal terms of paragraph 2.16, the Government have subsequently made it plain, both in Committee in another place and in the expert liaison group, that they have no intention of enshrining that commitment in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09011910000074"></a>My amendment seeks to do two things. First, the first proposed new subsection would require the Treasury to ensure that partial transfers have no effect on contracts that are relevant for regulatory capital purposes. Secondly, the second proposed new subsection tries to ensure that any secondary legislation made under either Clause 47 or Clause 48 would alter contracts that are relevant for regulatory capital purposes. I do not pretend that the wording of the proposed new subsections is perfect, and I have already indicated that I shall not divide the Committee on them today, but I hope that the Minister will look to their underlying purpose and respond in that light.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09011910000075"></a>Before getting to the meat of the amendment, I understand that the draft secondary legislation, which is being consulted on, will be made under Clause 48. There is a more general power in Clause 47, but I could find no reference to the purpose to which the Government intend to put it. I have drafted my amendment to cover both Clauses 47 and 48 on a belt-and-braces basis, but it would be helpful if the Minister set out the Government&#146;s intentions behind Clause 47.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09011910000076"></a>At the heart of the issues with which the amendment seeks to deal is the Government&#146;s basic approach to partial transfers. The Government wish to include as much as possible in secondary legislation and place as little as possible in the Bill. That, of course, is the customary government position in the name of flexibility. As I understand it, the banking community was initially prepared to go along with the Government&#146;s view on  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1448"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1448</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the basis that secondary legislation would cover its concerns, but I now detect a real concern about the likely content of the statutory instrument that is leading to a revived desire to see further changes to the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09011910000077"></a>My amendment seeks to deal with one important aspect, but while regulatory capital is an important issue, the concerns run wider. If there is any uncertainty about how the secondary legislation will affect contracts, it is that it will affect the overall attractiveness of London as a financial centre. It is likely that it would increase the cost of capital for UK banks, which will do nothing for their international competitiveness, and it will drive business out of London markets in favour of other jurisdictions where there is greater certainty.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09011910000078"></a>If there is any uncertainty about the legal position, it will be impossible to get clean legal opinions on contracts of set-off and similar contracts. That will certainly mean that they will not be effective for regulatory capital purposes both in the UK and in other countries. As I said, it will also make London an extremely unattractive place in which to do financial business, because, if the counterparties cannot get legal certainty, transactions simply will not happen. The lack of watertight set-off and netting arrangements also affects the non-bank counterparties and could disrupt conventional Treasury cash management techniques. It could also have an impact on what goes into the annual accounts not only of banks but of ordinary commercial businesses.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09011910000079"></a>My amendment today is based on regulatory capital on the basis that, if we can solve the issues for regulatory capital, the other problems will also be avoided. However, they may not be. Amendment 80, which is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and is in this group of amendments, seeks to tackle the problem from a different direction, and I look forward to him speaking to it.</p>

<a name="90119-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09011910000080"></a>There is a very real problem which will emerge as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. I understand that some banks are already involved in contingency plans in case the final version of the Bill leaves any doubts about the effectiveness of instruments for regulatory capital purposes. That contingency planning involves massive rewriting of contracts, and possibly things being taken out of the London market.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09011910000081"></a>What has concerned the industry is the draft statutory instrument, with its very wide carve-outs. It is difficult for the Committee to debate that draft statutory instrument, because it is not before us, but it underlies the concerns about the use to which Clauses 47 and 48 will be put. That is why I think it necessary to raise those issues. As the Minister will be aware, the industry wants to see set-off, netting and similar transactions left alone by partial transfers and completely unaffected by them. The industry is worried by the prospect of the carve-outs being made by the orders under Clauses 47 and 48. For example, the draft statutory instrument provides that foreign property is not to have protected rights. The BBA believes that the only viable way forward may be to exclude foreign property entirely from partial transfers.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09011910000082"></a>There are similar concerns about the carve-outs, such as in respect of deposits, and the issue of securities. All in all, the concerns which have been fed to us about  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1449"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the carve-outs, plus the uncertainty of not seeing the final version of the statutory instrument, have tilted the balance of opinion against carve-outs. People are certainly worried by the prospect of it being left to secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09011910000083"></a>The Government have said that some issues might be dealt with in the code of practice, but that would not be regarded as helpful. If such issues went to the heart of legal certainty, the code of practice would have absolutely no impact. We debated that in the context of Amendment 20, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, on our first Committee day. A code of practice is not enforceable by anyone and can contribute nothing to legal opinions. Similarly, the no-credit or worse-off regulations to be issued in Clause 60 will not improve the ability to issue clean legal opinions because they fall far short of a government indemnity.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09011910000084"></a>These are very difficult issues. I hope the Minister will be able to lay out the Government&#146;s current position. I do not expect this to be resolved today. The consultation has, as I said, passed, so I hope that he can give at least a preliminary response on that basis. The industry remains extremely concerned about the way in which the Government are approaching partial transfers and the impact it will have on financial instruments and the financial services industry in the UK. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09011910000085"></a><b><a name="90119-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011910000390"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I want to underline the noble Baroness&#146;s last point&#151;the industry is extremely concerned about these two clauses. For a layman like me it is almost impossible to judge whether these concerns are justified. To what extent in the ongoing discussions with the industry on the principle do the banks and the Government basically agree about what this is trying to achieve? Is the argument a technical one about whether this goes in primary or secondary legislation, or is there still a difference in principle&#151;or at all&#151;about how the legislation should deal with this immensely important but equally arcane issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>

The trouble is that in any negotiation to consider such a matter there is no leverage on the side of the banks.</p>

The dilemma we face here is that the Government have two good policies that they are trying to pursue at the same time but which have contradictory effects. One of the good policies is the ability to pursue partial transfers, which may be very important if a bank is in crisis, while the other is the Government&#146;s declared intention to promote netting and set-off arrangements. My amendment is designed to protect such netting and set-off arrangements by using the relatively strong but not decisive expression:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09011910000266"></a>&#147;A partial transfer ... shall not undermine any ... arrangements&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011910000254"></a>I have chosen this form of words because while close attention will need to be paid to the nature of such arrangements, it should not be absolutely prescriptive.  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1450"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1450</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The amendment attempts to sustain the arrangements and provide a degree of legal certainty while not being totally prescriptive with respect to the Government&#146;s actions.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09011910000088"></a>I am afraid that the subsections in Clauses 47 and 48 that attempt to provide some degree of legal certainty and to protect netting arrangements are quite unsatisfactory because they are all conditional on whether the Treasury &#147;may&#148; by order do something rather than that it &#147;will&#148; do something. The amendment would provide the degree of legal certainty necessary to protect set-off and netting arrangements without in turn limiting the Government&#146;s ability to pursue partial transfers, which may also be valuable. It may be that I am trying to square a circle and we might end up with two desirable policies that unfortunately conflict with one another, and therefore I am interested to learn how the Minister will deal with the potential conflict between these two dimensions of policy.</p>

It may aid the debate if I first provide a general introduction to what the Government are seeking to achieve in respect of this issue. I welcome the constructive introduction given by the noble Baroness to these amendments and I share her concern that it is important to get this right. I am sure that the representations that the Government have received from the banking industry and others have also been made to Members of the Committee. We are making good progress and I hope to be able to report on that later when setting out a route to reaching a satisfactory end position.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09011910000090"></a>I turn first to the issue of consultation, and I shall bring noble Lords up to date on the position. The consultation closed on 9 January. We received only 15 replies, but those in the stakeholder communities most interested in the matter have broadly welcomed the approach to the safeguards that we are establishing. Interest remains around the protection of set-off and netting, in particular the proposed carve-out from the safeguards. However, the Government are listening to concerns and a meeting is to be held with the expert liaison group this week to discuss the consultation responses. I would be happy to come back to noble Lords following that meeting, when we reconsider the Bill on Report.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09011910000091"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the Government recognise that partial transfers may be potentially invasive, and they have been working extremely hard to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. Responding to interested parties&#146; concerns, the Government are putting legislative safeguards in place to protect bank creditors and counterparties in a partial transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09011910000092"></a>As my noble friend Lord Eatwell said, there are two noble purposes here: to promote the opportunity for partial transfer and to protect the concepts and efficacy of offset and netting arrangements. It is a delicate balance to ensure that the language of the Bill can respect both those objectives. We certainly recognise the importance that market participants attach to  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1451"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set-off and netting arrangements, and to security interests. For example, legal certainty about a netting agreement is vital for risk management. Therefore, in responding to stakeholders&#146; concerns, the Government are consulting on the details of three safeguards.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09011910000093"></a>First, Clause 48 provides a safeguard to protect set-off and netting arrangements, on which so many bank counterparties rely. Secondly, to protect security interests, Clause 48 also provides a safeguard so that secured creditors retain recourse to their collateral. Thirdly, Clause 60, to which we will come in due course, provides a safeguard that we will provide compensation for creditors left in the residual bank&#151;and I hope this addresses the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles&#151;to ensure that they are made no worse off than if the whole bank had entered into insolvency procedure; that is, as if the authorities had not intervened. In addition, the code of practice will set out the types of circumstance in which the authorities would wish to consider a partial transfer.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09011910000094"></a>Building on the work done so far, the Government will continue to work with interested parties to develop these safeguards, as well as the other secondary legislation. To this end, the expert liaison group has been established to prepare the secondary legislation for the special resolution regime. The group has already met on various occasions and provided valuable advice on the detailed nature of the safeguards. Last November, having first sought the group&#146;s advice, the Government published draft statutory instruments for key safeguards. The consultation period for that document recently closed, as I have said, and we will be scrutinising those responses and finalising the secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09011910000095"></a>The amendments in this group relate to Clause 47, so I shall describe its provisions next. It enables restrictions to be placed on the making of partial transfers through the property transfer powers. The range of ways in which the Treasury may restrict partial transfers is deliberately broad. In addition to setting out restrictions, the power provides for secondary legislation to permit conditions to be imposed before a partial transfer can be undertaken, and it can require partial transfers to include particular provisions.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09011910000096"></a>Amendment 78 seeks to require the Treasury to make regulations under Clause 47 to protect contracts and arrangements that are relevant for the purposes of a firm&#146;s regulatory capital. Put simply, the calculation of how much regulatory capital a bank needs to hold is likely to be based, in part, upon the netting and set-off arrangements that it has in place. It is therefore important that those arrangements are protected, as was noted in the November consultation document.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09011910000097"></a>As I have already said, the Government are proceeding to scrutinise responses to the safeguards consultation and finalising the relevant secondary legislation. While it is important not to prejudge that exercise, I can say now that the secondary legislation to be made under Clause 48 will provide for substantial protection for set-off and netting arrangements. Such protection will cover the vast majority of contracts and arrangements relevant to regulatory capital purposes, which is important in order to address market concerns.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09011910000098"></a>However, the issue of regulatory capital is extremely complex. The Government&#146;s position is that rather than offer a general protection for regulatory capital,  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1452"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the secondary legislation should protect the types of contract that are important for regulatory capital. This approach provides greater certainty to counterparties about what is and is not covered. The Government consider that explicitly stating what kinds of contracts are protected is a more appropriate solution. As I have noted previously, it is also the Government&#146;s view that such provision is best suited to secondary legislation. With these reassurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel free to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09011910000099"></a>The amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Eatwell provides that a partial transfer may not undermine any pre-existing and close-out arrangements. Although I hope I have already made this clear, I should reiterate the Government&#146;s position that protecting netting arrangements is extremely important. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is right to emphasise that getting this right is critical to London and the UK remaining an important banking centre.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09011910000100"></a>I fully agree with the underlying purpose of my noble friend&#146;s amendment. However, the Government consider that there are significant benefits in partial transfers. These have been demonstrated by a number of recent resolutions, particularly in relation to Bradford &amp; Bingley plc. This is why the Government have proposed a strong set of protections for set-off and netting, but subject to limited tailored exceptions which will ensure that partial transfers can still take place in appropriate cases. The amendment, which provides that all netting and close-out arrangements must be protected without exception, would potentially prevent any partial transfers. But, as I have said, the Government agree with the general principles expressed by my noble friend that protecting set-off and netting arrangements is extremely important and we are putting in place detailed secondary legislation under Clause 48 to do just that. Draft orders have been published for consultation and the Government are currently scrutinising responses. I hope that this will reassure noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09011910000101"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked what safeguards the Government will introduce under Clause 47. She is right that the main safeguards will be made under the power in Clause 48. In Clause 47, the Government intend to use the power to provide a clear protection for counterparties which have been transferred to a bridge bank or private sector purchaser so that they have certainty that they will not be transferred back to the residual company. Details of this were provided in the consultation documents at paragraph 5.19 onwards. I hope that my noble friend also will not press his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09011910000104"></a>It is most disappointing that the Government are not prepared to back their clear statement in the consultation document that they have no intention of upsetting anything that is necessary for regulatory capital purposes. They are not prepared to reflect that clear commitment in legislation, which is what my amendment seeks to do&#151;although not necessarily in very good words&#151;and I urge them to think again.</p>

<p><a name="09011910000256"></a>This is something that we will discuss later this afternoon, and is not something that we want to achieve. It is such an important area and it is a pity that we will have no discussions before Report, because the issue is still open on whether the Bill has enough in it to justify the reliance on secondary legislation that the Government want. It will be difficult to decide whether the Bill goes far enough and we can rely on that secondary legislation. If the Minister can communicate before Report with members of the Committee who have an interest in this matter, that will help a more efficient process at Report stage.</p>

Orders as envisaged by Clause 47 are needed only because there is the possibility of partial transfers. Paragraph 1.14 of the special resolution regime is relevant to assessing whether you can make a general order. It says that the property transfer powers provide the authorities with the flexibility to split a bank. This option would most likely be used for the purposes of transferring the good part of a failing bank&#146;s business into a new company, either as private sector purchaser or a bridge bank. In either case a residual bank, a &#147;resco&#148;, would be left behind, containing any untransferred assets and liabilities.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09011910000114"></a>The following paragraph then quotes Bradford &amp; Bingley, but I do not think paragraph 1.14 applies to that company. The case of Bradford &amp; Bingley was much more like a temporary transfer into public ownership, not a transfer into a bridge bank. There was a private sector purchaser that purchased the good assets while the bad assets, or the less good assets, were brought into public ownership, whereas in the case of a bridge bank my understanding is that it would be the other way around&#151;that is to say, the  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1455"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good assets would be put into the bridge bank while the bad assets, or the less good assets, would be left behind. The justification for turning the policy around from the one that was pursued with Bradford &amp; Bingley is in the following paragraph: it would be less expensive for the funders of the resolution, the taxpayer, and, under proposals in the Bill, the FSCS.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09011910000115"></a>In considering orders under this clause, it is important to understand whether the Government are committed to this different policy&#151;indeed, as I see it, this reverse of the Bradford &amp; Bingley policy&#151;of taking the good assets into a bridge bank and leaving the bad assets in the existing, now residual, bank. That leads to a second question, as it leaves the shareholders with the task of dealing with the bad assets as there is no transfer of shares into a bridge bank, while the bridge bank, in the ownership of the Bank of England, has the good assets. In my submission, that brings greater complexity, and it is by no means certain that the costs will be lower; in fact, it is highly likely that the costs might eventually turn out to be higher. If and when you split a bank, although the Minister sought to reassure me earlier, I do not see how you can ever tell whether the shareholders in the residual bank will be better or worse off than they would have been had the bank been left whole. I do not understand how anyone could be sure what the outcome would have been if the bank had not been split, and therefore how you know whether people are worse off as a result.</p>

<a name="90119-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09011910000116"></a>I would like to be assured that the Bank of England has argued for this approach of taking the good assets into a bridge bank and leaving the less good ones behind. If it has so argued, what arguments has it put forward? I cannot believe that these would have rested on the expression &#147;less expensive&#148;. If it is decided to proceed with partial transfers, is there anything which could be called &#147;general&#148; about the order? I have sought to leave out the words which envisage the possibility of a general instrument. Indeed, the draft instrument, which is in the papers before us, looks quite specific. It will be an additional reassurance in the difficult area of legal certainty if the orders under partial transfer&#151;if indeed they go ahead&#151;are made specific and not left open to the possibility of also being general. I beg to move.</p>

Is there any reason, other than urgency, why the Minister thinks that we ought to have this done by statutory instrument, rather than by part of the Bill at a later stage in our proceedings?</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1456"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="09011910000119"></a><b><a name="90119-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011910000403"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate. I will do my best to answer the specific questions involved. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, raises some fundamental points with regard to the Government&#146;s intentions for these provisions and explains why he wants his amendment considered sympathetically. Clause 47 provides the authorities with the means to place restrictions on the nature of partial transfers that they may effect through the use of the property transfer powers provided by this part of the Bill. The making of the restrictions has the potential to provide bank stakeholders with greater certainty about how the property transfer powers will be used to effect partial transfers. As was clear from the previous debate, we are all concerned about certainty and clarity in what all who have considered them recognise are complex and difficult issues.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09011910000120"></a>To this end, the Government have recently consulted on what secondary legislation should be made under Clause 47. At this stage we are proposing that the power should be used to place restrictions on reverse property transfers. This restriction is designed to provide certainty to creditors transferred to a bridge bank that they will not be moved back to the residual bank. Consultation on this, and indeed a wide range of matters relating to partial transfer safeguards, is of course ongoing. As my noble friend indicated in the previous debate, we have consultations which are still to be concluded. We will keep the House fully informed of such developments, certainly in the context of our further consideration of the Bill on Report.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09011910000121"></a>The problem that we have with the amendment in the name of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is that it would remove the power for the Treasury to make orders on restrictions which apply to all partial transfers. In essence, the amendment would not allow the Government to make general restrictions on all partial transfers. It would allow us to make restrictions only to individual types of partial transfer.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09011910000122"></a>We believe that the power to make a wider range of different types of restriction is useful and ultimately beneficial to the market. Given the nature of the powers, stakeholder interest and technical complexity of the issue, the Government consider it appropriate to take a power in the Bill to provide for restrictions to be made as the authorities deem appropriate. In particular, it should be noted that these powers can be used only to restrict&#151;not, I hasten to add, broaden&#151;the nature of the partial transfers which can be made.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09011910000123"></a>I remind the Committee that the special resolution regime is a new legislative proposal. Experience may show that partial transfers should be more or less restricted than initially thought, to respond to continuing market reaction to these powers, or to the authorities&#146; developing practical expertise in resolving banks in difficulty. At the very least, the nature of the restrictions will need to be updated in line with innovation in the financial markets. Given this position, which I am sure commands the understanding of the Committee, we believe that the clause as drafted is ultimately helpful to stakeholders in allowing different forms of restrictions on the use of partial transfers.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09011910000124"></a>However, the noble Viscount raised one or two issues. He is absolutely right, of course, that the resolution of the Bradford &amp; Bingley problem was different from  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1457"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the situations provided for in the Bill. That resolution was conducted under a different Act which is due to expire in the very near future. That Act does not contain the powers for a bridge bank tool, which is provided for in the Bill and which I am sure commands considerable support. The reference to Bradford &amp; Bingley was included to demonstrate the benefit of a partial transfer approach in general terms. The industry supported the way in which the Bradford &amp; Bingley issue was resolved.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09011910000125"></a>I was asked whether the Bank of England agrees with partial transfers. The answer is yes. All the authorities, especially the Bank of England, support the need for partial transfers. All agree that we need the flexibility best to meet the special resolution regime objectives. The benefits include increasing the chance of private sector purchase, which is the objective of this part of the special resolution regime, particularly if it wanted to purchase only part of any such property. I was also asked by the noble Viscount whether partial transfers did not mean that costs were necessarily lower. Partial transfers offer the opportunity to leave bad assets behind&#151;I think that he conceded that point&#151;to enable them to be wound up in an orderly manner. This may well be fully in line with the SRR objectives, including, not least, the protection of public funds.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09011910000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pointed out a difficulty with statutory instruments, which I recognise; namely, that they are not amendable. However, we need the ability to update these safeguards as market practice develops. The Committee will recognise that we have provided for expert advice to be offered to the Government. Inevitably, we are faced&#151;no one can foresee a future different from the past in one respect&#151;with the increased rapidity of change and fluctuations in market activity and market practice. We need a flexibility that primary legislation can never convey. That is why we feel the need in this area to indicate that we will be using secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09011910000127"></a>It is also the case, as my noble friend indicated earlier, that we still have refinements and developments to make on the nature of secondary legislation, on which we are in active consultation. We will make the position as clear as we can as the Bill progresses through the House. I hope that the noble Viscount will feel that I have given him a reply that explains why his amendment would be restrictive; more restrictive than we want the legislation to be. Therefore, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

After all, we are talking about the nature of restriction. The noble Lord is right. Are we making provision against the eventuality that we might need to effect legislative change quite rapidly, which we could not possibly do through primary legislation and, therefore, which would involve a need to change a statutory instrument? We are seeking legal certainty for the market. The market can look at the legislation and know what cannot be transferred under a partial transfer. It is of the greatest importance that the market should recognise that. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will appreciate that where the Government think that they might have to think again it is always against the parameter of moving towards reducing restrictions. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that, in that respect, the Government are seeking to respond to a changing market in a positive way, with the overall objective of trying to give legal certainty in an area that we all recognise is complex, difficult and potentially rapidly changing.</p>

I assure the Committee that I am not looking to make trouble, as it were. I am looking to see how there could be more certainty. Market certainty is not just legal certainty; it is broader than that. I remain puzzled as to why, if the subsection read, &#147;An order may apply to transfers of a specified kind, or made or applying in specified circumstances&#148;, that would not in fact be quite adequate for the purpose of restriction under the system of partial transfers.</p>

It seems to me that there will be circumstances in which, first, it will be very difficult to know how to make a split between the good and the less good and, secondly, in which it would be sensible to take a mix of assets and not simply to look for the good ones.</p>

I also understand that the amendment has been discussed with the Treasury and others in the expert liaison group. The Government have tabled their own amendments in this group, which cover some of the same ground and to which the Minister will speak. I should say, in the expectation that he will resist my amendments, that we will accept the government amendments, but it is not the end of the story.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09011910000136"></a>I am sure that the Minister is aware that the banks and lawyers who have been engaged with this issue, while welcoming the moves that the Government have made with their amendments, are not convinced that the government amendments go far enough. The City of London Law Society recently submitted further comments to the Treasury. In particular, I understand that there is a desire to see the wording in Clause 48 made to conform to definitions used in regulation 3 of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 and regulation 2 of the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality) Regulations 1999.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09011910000137"></a>These are not mere technical issues of drafting preference. An eminent lawyer with whom I was in contact last week said that they are of considerable practical and legal importance in achieving the necessary level of certainty and confidence in the financial markets. Therefore, I anticipate that this is not the end of the story and that we will almost certainly need to return to this issue on Report. In the mean time, I hope that the Government will accept the importance of having legally watertight definitions of these terms in the Bill, because that will drive what is to be covered by the regulations made under the clause. I hope that the Minister will respond by stating the position as the Government now see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09011910000138"></a>Will the Minister address specifically the issues relating to Scottish law? There are some specific Scottish words in my amendment, and another issue has arisen since I tabled it on whether there needs to be a reference to trusts used in Scotland as an alternative to contracts, because Scots law does not accommodate equitable transfers. Do the Government accept that something is needed in Clause 48 to reflect the Scots law dimension? I assure him that his answer will be read with interest north of the border. I beg to move.</p>

The clause completely underestimates the extent of the hazard which is initiated and which causes untold suffering and confusion to all parties in trying to bring about a satisfactory resolution of any transfer of a bank&#146;s ownership in these circumstances. The Insolvency Act 1986 is extremely explicit on the rules governing offset. It has become a matter of custom and practice and is very well policed and overseen by the insolvency practitioner profession, which, to my knowledge, has produced no great dissent during its 23 years of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09011910000141"></a>I invite the Minister to consider an actual case in which I was involved. You have to bear in mind that on the day that you close out a huge transaction such as this, a lot of people will rush to complete transactions against the clock. Let us suppose that on the morning of the day when you are going to close the whole deal, you receive a transfer of half a billion pounds&#146; worth of funds from America, representing a combination of consideration and debt repayment for a subsidiary of a company that banks with the bank with which you are dealing. To whom does that half billion belong in the hours leading up to and through the completion process? There are at least half a dozen applicants for the ownership of that money. If the Government now try to introduce a provision that effectively gives them the right to direct where that half billion goes, they will spend the rest of their natural life in litigation.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09011910000142"></a>The situation is complex. First, the assumption is that the company being sold is owned by a company which banks with a syndicate of banks, because all these loans are syndicated. Some &#163;200 million of the &#163;500 million is due to be the consideration, but when, only two hours away from the company being sold or restructured, the banks get the half billion pounds, they will try to imply that the whole amount belongs to them to divide according to whatever ratio they represent in sharing the overall debt of the company to the banks. That immediately opens up the possibility of a challenge by the shareholding owners of the company that has effectively sold the company in question, and beyond that is the question of who provided the funding to the company. Perhaps it was a subsidiary owned in America&#151;which is what happened in my case&#151;with &#163;300 million of debt to the American subsidiary. What about the American banks? Would they not have a claim? They would have lawyers queuing up to have a go on that one.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09011910000143"></a>The whole situation is so complex that it seems the only safe way for the Government to deal with it is to knock out paragraph (c) in order to allow the Insolvency Act 1986 to continue to rule. It has never let us down yet and it will guide us with accuracy through any challenge that may come. The Government have a hard enough task already; they should not make it go from the difficult to the impossible.</p>

Amendment 82 would amend the clause to read that &#147;security interests&#148; means &#147;arrangements under which one person acquires by way of security an actual or contingent interest in the property of another&#148;. The amendment seeks to introduce into the clause the phrase &#147;by way of security&#148;. Does that mean by way of the exercise of security or does it mean, as I think it probably does, by way of the taking as security for a liability of an interest in the property? I am sure that the noble Lord will have no difficulty in putting me right on that.</p>

I thank her for the constructive way in which she has introduced the amendments in her name, and her indication that she intends not to press them to a vote but rather to seek a better explanation and to help shape and influence our thinking as we approach Report. I am confident that we have interests in common and that all parties are committed to seeking the best possible wording.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09011910000146"></a>As I have noted, Clause 48 provides a broad definition of the interests to be protected. This is intentional and ensures that the secondary legislation to be made under the power is not restricted by the technical definitions in the clause. Further detailed technical provision will be unsuitable for primary legislation. In short, this ensures that a broad range of interests can be included within the scope of the safeguard power and seeks to ensure that the safeguard power remains sufficiently adaptable to accommodate innovation in the financial markets.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09011910000147"></a>The Government have received a number of representations from industry bodies and practitioners in relation to the definitions used in this clause. While I emphasise that Clause 48 is an enabling power, so is not the legislation which provides the actual protection, the Government consider it appropriate to amend the definitions to eliminate any outstanding doubt about the types of interests the clause is designed to protect. In broad terms, the amendments do two things. First, they separate the definition of security interests from title-transfer arrangements. Although the economic effect of the two types of arrangements may be either the same or similar, there are significant legal distinctions between the two. For example, a title-transfer security arrangement involves the outright transfer of ownership of the property in question from one party to another. This is not normally the case with security interests, which typically involve the acquisition by a creditor of a right in property which remains owned by the debtor. As a result, the Government consider it desirable to remove the definition of title-transfer arrangements from the definition of security arrangements and to define it separately. Secondly, the Government&#146;s amendments make clear that the power does not treat set-off and netting as synonymous concepts. Although netting arrangements sometimes use set-off, netting can also be achieved through other methodology legally distinct and separate from set-off.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09011910000148"></a>The Government&#146;s intention in bringing forward Clause 48 is not to change the existing legal concepts of security interests, set-off and netting arrangements and title-transfer security arrangements. Rather, the purpose of Clause 48 is to enable protection to be provided for these interests in the context of partial transfers under the special resolution regime, while allowing scope for the enabling power to address changes to these concepts as industry usage continues to develop and innovate. Some may say we have had a bit too much innovation in banking in recent years, but the industry will continue to innovate to meet the needs of its customers and we must be careful that we do not inhibit the benefits that can arise from innovation.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09011910000149"></a>I believe our intention is made absolutely clear by the provision of Clause 48 which indicates that these definitions only apply for the purpose of this section.  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1463"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is hoped, however, that the amendments in my name usefully clarify the intentions of the Government in view of the helpful representations that have been made by interested parties. I hope that the government amendments will be accepted.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09011910000150"></a>It is my understanding that opposition Amendments 81 and 95 would have a similar effect to the government amendments tabled in relation to this clause. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, indicated that that was the case. These amendments would make technical changes to the definitions used in Clause 48. In particular, they relate to the definitions of &#147;security interests&#148;, &#147;set-off&#148;, &#147;netting&#148; and &#147;netting arrangements&#148;.</p>

<a name="90119-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09011910000151"></a>While the Government agree with the broad purpose of the amendments, they consider that the amendments tabled in my name offer a more appropriate solution. Noble Lords may find it useful if I explain why the government amendments differ slightly from those proposed by the noble Baroness. In broad terms, the difference is one of level of detail.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90119-0005.htm"/>


<a name="90119-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09011910000152"></a>I start by noting that Clause 48 does not provide the actual safeguard. It is, as I said, an enabling power, providing the Treasury with the power to make appropriate safeguarding secondary legislation. There is a risk that, in seeking greater detail in the clause and in using technical terminology, the opposition amendments may unduly narrow the scope of the enabling power.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09011910000153"></a>Perhaps it would help if I gave an example of this. The opposition amendments would introduce terminology relating to the law of England and Wales, and Scotland, into the definition of security interests. The Government, by contrast, think it preferable to describe security interests in the generic terms alluded to in my introductory remarks. This approach ensures that the potential scope of protection of Clause 48 can include English security interests, but also security interests granted under other legal systems. The use of domestic terminology in the amendment may imply&#151;an unintended consequence, I am sure, but one that illustrates my wider point&#151;an intention to exclude foreign law security interests from the security interests that may be protected under Clause 48.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09011910000154"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked about Scottish law. There is, of course, considerable interest in this Bill in Scotland, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The benefit of using broad and generic terms in the clause is that that enables the broadest range of interests to be protected, including those under Scottish and, indeed, foreign law regimes. Greater precision can, if necessary, be used in the order made under the clause. We are aware of the issue with Scottish trust law and are considering it further, but we are grateful to the noble Baroness for raising it in debate. We will certainly introduce further amendments if that proves necessary to address the particular requirements of Scottish trust law.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09011910000155"></a>In reciprocity to the constructive way in which the noble Baroness has presented these amendments, I would be more than happy to offer a meeting between industry lawyers, including those to whom she referred, Treasury legal advisers and parliamentary counsel to discuss Clause 48, if that were considered helpful. These are highly technical provisions and I think that all noble Lords are agreed that it is important that we  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1464"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>get them right. I hope that the noble Baroness accepts this explanation and remains of the view that she need not press Amendments 81 and 95 but can support instead the government amendments brought forward in relation to this clause.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09011910000156"></a>The paragraph that Amendment 85 would omit makes it clear that netting arrangements include what is known commercially as &#147;close-out netting&#148;. This is an important type of netting arrangement. Following a trigger event, a party under a close-out netting arrangement is entitled to close out all outstanding contracts subject to the netting arrangement, calculate a sum&#151;for example, related to profit or loss&#151;in respect of each and then work out a net sum either owed or owing.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09011910000157"></a>One of the principal characteristics of close-out netting is that it permits netting in respect of contracts that have not fully run their course&#151;for example, where both parties have not yet finished performing their obligations under the contract and no actual debt is owed or owing at the time of the trigger event. That is why the definition refers to theoretical debts. That form of netting is important. For example, it is used in the master agreements of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The omission of that definition would suggest that Clause 48 was not intended to be capable of being used to protect that form of netting.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09011910000158"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, asked a series of complicated questions about a theoretical example. I am aware that what I say at the Dispatch Box can be relied on by the courts as indicating the Government's thinking. It would be unwise for me to seek to address at the Dispatch Box the technical questions that he raised. Instead I offer to address them, if I can, in writing, so that he can have the benefit of that explanation and the words that I used immediately prior to my statement to reach a conclusion on whether he wants to table his amendment again on Report. On that basis, I invite him not to move his amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09011910000163"></a>The Bill provides a permanent framework to deal with banks in difficulties, building on and refining the temporary tools introduced by the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, to which my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham referred a few moments ago.

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09011910000164"></a>The special resolution regime provides a clear framework for the exercise of these powers, including clearly stated objectives, conditions for entry into the special resolution regime and a code of practice providing further guidance to the authorities in exercising these powers. The SRR includes new tools to deal with failing banks, including the bridge bank, two new insolvency procedures&#151;the bank insolvency procedure for fast pay-out to depositors and the bank administration procedure to make partial transfers effective. We will come to these procedures later. The essence of the Bill is to anticipate the possibilities and to ensure that we have the necessary response mechanisms available to us in order to achieve outcomes consistent with the Bill&#146;s objectives.</p>

That could describe a meeting of Treasury lawyers and City lawyers. As far as I am concerned, the most useful way forward is that the Treasury talks to the banking community. If the banking community remains concerned, then I must raise those concerns with the Minister. I do not believe that there is anything that I personally can add to the resolution, but I think it is very important that, as a matter of urgency, those discussions are continued.</p>

These are probing amendments to explore the consequences of no statutory instrument being made under Clause 48 or of such an instrument being delayed.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09011910000173"></a>Under Clause 48, it is left to the Treasury&#146;s discretion as to whether the Treasury makes an order that restricts the partial property transfers to deal with the problems of set-off and so on. In another place, the Minister undertook to discuss with his officials whether this formulation should be mandatory, especially in view of the huge importance attached to it in the financial community. I could find no trace of that being discussed further, which is probably not surprising as the Report stage in another place was very truncated: hence I have tabled a conventional &#147;may&#148;-to-&#147;shall&#148; amendment&#151;Amendment 88&#151;to tease this out further.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09011910000174"></a>There is considerable unease among the banks about there being any delay between the Act and the related statutory instrument coming into force. This is on top of the concerns about the content of the instrument, which we have already debated. The concerns relate more to the paragraph 2.16 commitment in the November White Paper to protect contracts relevant for regulatory capital, which we debated in our discussion on an earlier amendment, and to the fact that, if there is no certainty about an acceptable statutory instrument being available immediately after Royal Assent, there will be a period of great uncertainty for banks and their customers. I have already mentioned today that it is understood that some banks are already devoting considerable time and effort to planning the unwinding of positions in case adequate legal certainty is not available. This could involve considerable cost and could, in extremis, push international banks towards relocating their operations outside the UK.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09011910000175"></a>My Amendment 92 is an attempt to deal with this uncertainty. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09011910000276"></a>&#147;Until an order has been made under this section a partial property transfer shall have no effect on security interests, set-off or netting arrangements&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011910000257"></a>That is, those arrangements cannot be unpicked by a partial transfer unless a statutory instrument under Clause 48 is already in place, setting out how they are to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09011910000176"></a>I do not pretend that the wording of the amendment is ideal, but we need to find a way of giving certainty to the banking community. The Government will say that they will use the accelerated statutory instrument procedure set out in Clause 249, which we will come to if we ever get to that clause. However, that does not mean that a satisfactory statutory instrument will be produced and it does not guarantee that a period of uncertainty will be avoided. We need to find a solution in the Bill to this problem. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09011910000177"></a><b><a name="90119-0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09011910000427"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for introducing her two amendments. As she rightly said, the first amendment was tabled in Committee in the other place, and the Economic Secretary undertook at that stage to consider the point that it raises. There has been considerable consideration of the issue, and the Government were not unaware that the matter might be raised when the Bill came before your Lordships&#146; House. Once this point had been identified in the other place, we gave considerable thought to it, but we do not think that a change to the drafting is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09011910000178"></a>Clause 48(2) provides for a range of things to which the safeguarding order may relate. Indeed, there are four paragraphs to the subsection, and it may turn out that one of them is not used in any order that is made. Clause 46, inevitably, is drawn in broad terms so as not to constrain the degree and nature of protection that may be provided by the secondary legislation that may be made under it. I emphasise the Government&#146;s commitment to making this secondary legislation and to providing the adequate protection that it will contain. I hope that the consultation document makes clear intent with regard to the safeguards that the draft orders need to embrace.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09011910000179"></a>The Government&#146;s continued work with the expert liaison group provides further evidence of our determination to provide accurate secondary legislation under what is recognised in the clause to be an enabling power. We of course agree with the noble Baroness that the secondary legislation is of great import. I hope that she agrees that we are approaching this with the greatest seriousness and the fullest consultation on how we intend to proceed.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09011910000180"></a>Amendment 92 relates to what may happen until an order is made under Clause 48 and is in place. It is the Government&#146;s clear intention to have these safeguards in secondary legislation in place at the same time as the relevant property transfer powers in the Bill come into force. The provisions of the secondary legislation will be coterminous with the activation of the property transfer powers of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09011910000181"></a>The consultation period on the document providing draft safeguards has just finished and the Government are working with the expert liaison group to finalise the order. On the procedure for ensuring that the orders are in place in time, I remind the Chamber that the Bill was amended in the other place to ensure that these essential pieces of secondary legislation can, if necessary, be put in place at short notice.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09011910000182"></a>The noble Baroness referred to Clause 249; she looks forward to reaching it as enthusiastically as I do. It provides that these instruments are put in place via the 28-day affirmative procedure instead of the draft affirmative procedure; in other words, they become immediately valid and implementable unless they are withdrawn by resolution of Parliament within the 28-day period. This applies only to the first time that the powers are exercised.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09011910000183"></a>I hope that it is clear that the secondary legislation will be put in place at the time that the provisions to which they relate come into force. The noble Baroness will appreciate that we have thought long and hard

I hope she will consider that she has had sufficient reassurance to withdraw her amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="09011910000184"></a><b><a name="90119-0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09011910000428"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply. I understand the Government&#146;s rationale in respect of &#147;may&#148; or &#147;shall&#148; in my Amendment 88, in the particular in relation to the way in which Clause 48(2) is drafted. I see that that my amendment is not appropriate there.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09011910000185"></a>The Government ought not to object to my Amendment 92. If they are in earnest about getting the statutory instrument out coterminously with Royal Assent, no problem would arise. If for some reason the statutory instrument were delayed&#151;there could be many reasons for that; for example, continuing discussions with the parties about it&#151;my amendment would provide a failsafe mechanism which would otherwise not be necessary. It would apply only to deal with legal certainty in that period. I emphasise that a period of uncertainty because the statutory instrument is not in force could cause banks to unwind a whole series of transactions. That would be most unfortunate.</p>

<a name="90119-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09011910000186"></a>I regard Amendment 92 as something to be considered further between now and Report. That will depend partly on progress in producing a statutory instrument that is acceptable to all parties. If there is any doubt about that, I may wish to return to the issue. As I have said, legal uncertainty during what might be only a transitional period could be as damaging as legal uncertainty in the whole area. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have spent the past hour or so talking about these transfers and it is clear that important issues arise out of them in connection with set-off, netting and other similar transactions. Even if agreement is reached and harmony breaks out between the Treasury and the banks over the next few weeks over what the terms of the statutory instrument should be, we ought not to be in any doubt that this is difficult territory where people may not have worked out what is exactly the right answer. For example, the British Bankers&#146; Association is concerned that practical problems and unintended consequences may emerge which need to be dealt with. That is not to challenge the bona fides of the Treasury in conducting and responding to its consultation, but to state a fact of life about this hugely complicated area. The amendment therefore proposes an annual assessment which, although it may appear to be onerous, addresses such an important area that goes to the heart of whether or not transactions work for regulatory capital purposes, possibly actually destroying the market in the UK, that it needs to be set against the damage that could be done to our banking industry.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09011910000188"></a>The amendment requires the Treasury to consult the Banking Liaison Panel, the group being brought together for the purpose of looking at secondary legislation, and, importantly, requires it to make proposals for dealing with any aspects that are regarded as unsatisfactory. We have of course included the requirement to publish the assessment and to lay it before Parliament to allow for an appropriate level of involvement should it so choose.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09011910000189"></a>I hope that the Government will regard this amendment as a practical way forward. If it is accepted, it would take away some of the concerns about getting everything absolutely right either in Clauses 47 and 48 or in the first statutory instrument that will be made thereunder. At least the industry would be satisfied that there is a genuine intention on the part of the Government to keep this under positive review. I beg to move.</p>

That is the burden of this amendment, which calls for an annual report to assess their efficacy. We recognise that partial transfers might be invasive, and have made it a matter of the utmost priority that effective and appropriate safeguards are indeed in place. I hope that the extensive consultation carried out by the Government demonstrates our commitment to working with the industry to get those safeguards right&#151;a key reason for establishing the expert liaison group. The Committee will know that the group is to be put on a statutory footing; the Government will, therefore, be bound to have regard to its recommendations.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09011910000193"></a>Clause 10, which we considered some time ago, thus provides a mechanism for the Government to receive not annual but regular and expert feedback on what we should consider regarding these issues. Regular feedback is important, but we contend that it will be necessary to update the safeguards over time, with the feedback being crucial in indicating to the Government why they should be changed. That is the basis of the secondary legislation we are bringing forward under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09011910000194"></a>The Government consider it desirable to retain flexibility to adjust and refine the safeguards in the light of experience, particularly in the context of set-off and netting, because those arrangements have proved to be highly innovative and a challenging development. In particular, the latter has developed and evolved in a comparatively short time, illustrating that this legislation needs built-in flexibility to cope with a significantly changing environment.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09011910000195"></a>Changes to the safeguard may be necessary to ensure that it continues to protect what it was intended to and that innovations do not undermine the policy aims that the special resolution regime is intended to serve. The expert liaison group will continue to advise the Government on the development of secondary legislation related to the partial transfer safeguards, but the Government consider its remit to be wider than that. Clause 10 makes it clear that the group should advise on the secondary legislation in Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill, although, as I made clear in our earlier debate, use of the stabilisation powers and compensation provisions rightly fall outside the group&#146;s remit. It is appropriate that the Government continue to consult with the industry over the broad range of secondary legislation made under the Bill&#151;not just on the safeguards, important as they undoubtedly are given the focus of this amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09011910000196"></a>On the amendment itself, the formal reporting requirement is neither desirable nor necessary. What form of assessment may be made, or may be possible, might depend on whether any resolutions are carried  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1472"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out; the authorities have already committed to report on those resolutions in the draft code of practice. I agree with the noble Baroness when she emphasises that reviewing the safeguards is important, but the Government consider that to be done best through the mechanisms that we are putting in place, particularly the group. That is for two key reasons.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09011910000197"></a>First, it may be necessary for evaluation and improvement to be undertaken more often than annually. The expert liaison group can meet on a number of occasions during the year, and report to the Government on those matters. Secondly, an assessment by market experts and industry practitioners is important. I note that the noble Baroness shares this view because a requirement for consultation with the expert liaison group forms a crucial part of her amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09011910000198"></a>As far as Parliament is concerned, any amendment to the secondary legislation in relation to safeguards will be subject to the draft affirmative procedure. Therefore Parliament will have an opportunity to scrutinise and debate the provisions of the safeguards. I hope the noble Baroness recognises that, through her amendment, she has pressed the Government on the nature of the reporting on these developments, which will take place much more frequently than annually, and that Parliament will also play its part with regard to the orders.

However, the final position as far as Parliament is concerned is that the provisions of the safeguards will be scrutinised and debated when the affirmative orders are laid. We will have both a flexible and more frequent forum within which experts can express opinions to the Treasury about developments and necessities in the field, and Parliament will act properly in regard to the orders.</p>

These provisions would ensure suitable compensation for those who have netting or set-off contracts associated with a bank that is then the subject of a special resolution regime&#151;compensating them for any losses that they may suffer as a result of the implementation of the special resolution regime. The idea is that, instead of dealing with the difficult issue of clean legal opinion, we say, &#147;Okay, we might not be able to proceed in that direction, but we can provide a compensation regime that will provide comfort and cover some of the uncertainty with which we are struggling and that unfortunately we seem to have introduced while pursuing the laudable objective of developing the special resolution regime&#148;.

Is the Minister saying that it would be appropriate to compensate counterparties as if the alternative was that nothing had happened and that the bank had continued trading? Presumably in many cases, the Government are intervening only because the alternative would be that the bank goes into insolvency. Clearly, when a bank goes into insolvency, there are procedures by which counterparties can settle their claims legally. One would not want them to get more compensation from the Government than they would in the alternative situation. If one accepts this principle, is there a way of wording this that would require the Government to compensate counterparties only if they could make a case that they were put in a worse position by the Government&#146;s action than they would have been by an insolvency action?</p>

I refer to the blanket indemnity that the Treasury would be expected to provide, in circumstances where a whole range of actions, including the speculation referred to by the noble Lord, might take place while these activities were going on.</p>

I know what he means: as an academic, he means that it is a challenging question for him and a vexed question for the Government. There is no doubt that it is a difficult area, which is why I am grateful for his proposals. We have been working closely with interested parties to ensure the appropriate protection for such arrangements and during those discussions interested parties have told us that the best way of ensuring legal certainty in the market on this matter is to protect set-off and netting requirements through a legislative restriction on disrupting those arrangements, which has been the Government&#146;s approach to the Bill. That is why we are putting in place the secondary legislation that will give effect to the powers conferred by Clause 48, and I am confident that we can use this approach to allow the authorities sufficient flexibility to undertake partial transfers while assuaging market concerns regarding netting and set-off.</p>

The formal consultation ended on 9 January and we are scrutinising the response before finalising policy in this area, which, as the Committee will recognise, is an area of developing policy. We intend that, as far as possible, we will be able to make all these issues clear before the Bill has received its final consideration in the House.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09011910000212"></a>The order that will implement that policy will be subject to a debate in both Houses. As we mentioned on the previous amendment, the first exercise of these powers will be under the 28-day procedure, which will enable the safeguard for set-off and netting to come into force simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to the special resolution regime. Any changes made thereafter can be only through the draft affirmative procedure, so we are ensuring full parliamentary scrutiny of these developments.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09011910000213"></a>The Bill already has in place arrangements for the assessment of compensation for third parties who suffer a compensatable interference in their property rights by way of the Third Party Compensation Scheme Order in Clause 59, a matter that I have no doubt will be the subject of considerable debate when we reach that point. Where a person suffers a compensatable interference in his property rights contrary to Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that every person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, provision for compensation must indeed be made. In accordance with that, the assessment of any compensation due must be conducted in accordance with the principles of fairness. The Government believe that the procedure for the determination of third party compensation&#151;for example, through the appointment of an independent valuer&#151;is compliant with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol 1 and would provide adequate compensation for the purposes of Article 6. Further than that, the Government are seeking to protect all set-off and netting contracts, with the exception of specific carve-outs on which we are consulting.</p>

<a name="90119-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09011910000214"></a>We believe that this is the right approach to providing market confidence regarding partial transfers. I am grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue&#151;it gives the Government the opportunity again to assert how important these issues are and how much we are bound with regard to the issue of compensation. However, I bear in mind the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, that, in circumstances where significant actions can be taken in the market, the Government have to be circumspect about just how blanket their commitment to compensation would be. It is on that basis that the Government, having considered these matters, prefer the proposals in the Bill rather than the amendment that my noble friend has so helpfully proposed. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

The compensation should not be greater than that which would be encountered in insolvency. I recognise that this is a significant criticism of the amendments as I have tabled them. What the debate has made clear to me is that perhaps some of this compensation route is an appropriate way of dealing with this difficult problem. We need to look at the compensation route in alliance with the other ways that we are attempting to deal with it. Given that the Minister has said that those considerations will continue, and given, especially, his incredible generosity in correcting Amendment 80, which I will now introduce on Report in the Government&#146;s own language, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It varies according to the context. It therefore may be difficult to define on an ex ante basis, but ought not to be difficult to define when coming to an individual order. What do the Government have in mind? Will it always be the case that the valuer is independent of the tripartite authorities; that is, the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA? Does the valuer have to be independent of any person who could benefit from a compensation order? In the case of widely held securities, how is that to be interpreted if the valuer is, say, a partnership or a company?

It is obviously very important that anyone acting as a valuer should be independent. It may be difficult to find such a person unless we are clear what the criteria are as some people may already have a history in these matters which those affected by a claim for compensation, or who are making a claim for compensation, might think ought to be taken into account. I am also not the least bit clear what the qualifications of such a valuer will be. Are they to be accountants, bankers, economists or whatever? Indeed, will a single individual be adequate to meet the point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09011910000221"></a>The other thing that strikes me&#151;it is a simple point&#151;is that the Treasury will appoint someone to appoint the valuer. So the question is not only whether the valuer will be independent but whether the person appointing the valuer will be independent, particularly as he will be appointed by the Treasury. Perhaps the noble Lord could reassure us on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09011910000223"></a>Clause 54 sets out the provisions for appointing and removing an independent valuer. There was extensive discussion in the other place about the need to make appropriate provision for the assessment of compensation. Compensation may, of course, be required in circumstances where there is a compensatable interference in a person&#146;s property rights. Clause 54 provides two safeguards to put the independence and impartiality of the valuer on the strongest footing. First, the appointment of the independent valuer must be made by an independent appointing person. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked who that would be.</p>

<p><a name="09011910000259"></a>not necessarily an independent person. Therefore, we do not get independence coming in at that level. An entirely partial person could make the appointment.</p>

We seek to distance authorities from the appointment as far as we can. The noble Baroness appears to be saying that a further safeguard needs to be inserted. I shall look at that but I make it absolutely clear that we seek to take the appointment away from government bodies directly to ensure that the procedure will be carried out by someone who is independent of the authorities in order to further guarantee that the person appointed will be considered independent. The appointing person can either make the appointment having regard to any criteria specified in the compensation scheme order, or must select a candidate from a list supplied by the Treasury. This allows for an independent person or panel to appoint a person who has the appropriate skills and expertise to carry out the process of valuation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09011910000226"></a>Subsection (4) ensures that an independent valuer can be removed only by a person specified by the Treasury and on the grounds of serious misconduct or incapacity, ensuring that the independent valuer has security of tenure and a level of independence as far as any removal from office might be concerned.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09011910000227"></a>Clause 55 provides that the independent valuer may do anything necessary or desirable for the purpose of, or in connection with the performance of, the function of his office in order that he may carry out his role effectively. Clause 55 further provides that the Treasury may confer other functions on the independent valuer. For example, the Treasury may enable the independent valuer to apply to a court or tribunal for an order requesting information from parties, should this be necessary. The Treasury may also enable the independent valuer to publish, disclose or withhold information at his discretion. The clause therefore provides the valuer with the powers to gather and deal with the information that he needs in order to conduct effectively his valuation function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09011910000228"></a>Finally, Clause 56 sets out the remuneration procedure.

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09011910000231"></a>As these provisions are included in the Bill&#151;I have identified three consecutive clauses in which this is spelt out in considerable detail&#151;I do not believe that further criteria on the independence of any valuer are needed in secondary legislation. The primary legislation is very clear about the nature of the independence of the valuer and how that will be identified and protected in his actions. I reassure the noble Baroness that the independent valuer will be appointed in accordance with the principles of fairness, as prescribed under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Accordingly, the independent valuer will be independent from the interested parties, including the authorities and the Bank, and independent of other conflicts of interest, such as those derived from his own shareholdings. This is a requirement in terms of the international position in the European Convention on Human Rights. Of course, we will be fulfilling that requirement in the way in which the independent valuer is appointed.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09011910000232"></a>I entirely appreciate the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns that this role must meet the strictest standards of independence. We are governed by the European convention and, of course, by our concerns that are shared with the noble Baroness that this crucial role should have its independence guaranteed. That is why so much is spelt out in primary legislation and why we, therefore, do not accept that additional legislative provision needs to be made in secondary legislation. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that I have given her the reassurance she needs to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I take it from what the Minister said that he will seek to add a simple amendment to Clause 54(2) on the independence of the person who will make the appointment. He is not a figure of insignificance, given that he is specifically mentioned for remuneration and everything else. Will the Minister consider whether it is appropriate for the appointing person to be appointed by the Treasury, rather than, for example, the Lord Chancellor, or someone of that kind?</p>

However, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will also appreciate that this role will be demanding in the most extensive way and require particular areas of expertise. Therefore, it is not surprising that we regard this rather more as a Treasury matter than one for the Lord Chancellor. However, I take on board the noble Lord&#146;s point. I can see the advantages of the additional independence that he is seeking, but he will appreciate that we need to ensure that our appointments to this highly skilled and important role of independent valuer are effective.</p>

The main burden of my reasons for tabling the amendment was to ensure that the valuer was independent of the subject matter being valued&#151;the failed bank and the property being transferred&#151;and that the issue was adequately dealt with. The Minister referred me to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I need to think about whether simply reading the convention in relation to the Bill is a sufficient set of safeguards, and I shall do that between now and Report.

The clause specifies that a compensation scheme order may provide for an independent valuer to assess the compensation due to those who suffer interferences in their property rights that are subject to compensation as a result of an exercise of the powers under this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09011910000243"></a>We do not consider it necessary to put in place a bespoke appeal mechanism to satisfy the requirements set out in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The possibility of recourse to judicial review satisfies the convention rights in that regard. However, for general policy reasons, once an independent valuer has arrived at his determination, we believe it is necessary and important that parties affected by that determination are able to ask the valuer to reconsider his decision and that they may appeal it in a court or tribunal.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09011910000244"></a>It is of course typical in the English legal system to put in place arrangements for the review or appeal of determinations in relation to civil cases. In the case of the arrangements for the assessment of compensation for the former shareholders of Northern Rock, an independent valuer with specialist expertise in commercial valuations has been appointed to undertake the difficult and complex task of valuation. Parties affected by his determination have a right to request the independent valuer to reconsider his determination, which provides an opportunity for the parties to make relevant representations in that regard.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09011910000245"></a>Following any redetermination, an appeal may be made to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal, which has both commercial and legal expertise, and is therefore ideally suited to adjudicating over any disputes relating to the valuer&#146;s determination.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09011910000246"></a>We believe that this procedure for appeals is far more satisfactory than simply leaving parties to bring a claim for judicial review of the determination. That is why we consider it entirely appropriate that the Treasury must provide for such arrangements in the event that an independent valuer is appointed. I believe that this provision is an important part of the Bill and I wish to retain it. I hope that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, will appreciate that we set considerable store by the part of the Bill which he wants to see removed, and I hope that he will accept the Government&#146;s reasons for wishing to retain it.</p>

I can see now that my amendment should simply have sought to leave out paragraph (a) of subsection (6).

In the proposed system, there will be an appointing person, an independent valuer, his staff and monitors, and overall, and at every stage subject to the drafting of the secondary legislation, the Treasury. It all sounds very expensive. Are there precedents for monitors of remuneration and/or compensation schemes, and, if so, in what circumstances? Has the requisite work been done to estimate the cost of all this? For example, judging from a previous debate, a tender might be put out in the search for a valuer and, if so, his remuneration will be set out in a contract. What would the monitor&#146;s responsibilities be and who would the monitor be? I suppose that it could be a Treasury official but I guess from previous debates that that is not the intention. Perhaps the monitors are to be chosen, following another tendering procedure, from the private sector. Can we have a fuller explanation of the need for monitors? I beg to move.</p>

The noble Viscount even slipped in that we might have it in mind for the job to be given to someone from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury. That would be somewhat contradictory to the whole thinking behind this role, and I assure the noble Viscount that my notes say something entirely different. For example, a judge might undertake the role on a non-commercial basis. Here, we are concerned only that the Treasury should provide allowances and be responsible for the resources that make remuneration possible. The monitor&#146;s role is clear. We want to ensure that there is someone to oversee the valuer&#146;s remuneration and allowances, including the pension arrangements, and we want that to be processed as independently as possible. We do not want the Treasury to do this job. Although, as I am sure the Committee will appreciate, it would be more than capable of carrying out such a role with true independence, it might not be recognised among all parties that it was not compromising the concept of independence. That is why the monitor will be required to approve certain actions by the independent valuer&#151;for example, the appointment of staff&#151;and this will be done not by the Treasury but through this additional independent role.</p>

<a name="09011919000004"></a><b><a name="90119-0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="09011919000101"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I tabled my opposition to Clause 57 standing part of the Bill in order to initiate a short debate about the role of valuation principles in the context of a valuation. My fundamental question is why Clause 57 needs to exist if an independent valuer, who is presumably competent to carry out a valuation, is appointed. I do not object to the content of subsection (3), which ensures that a valuer does not pass on the value of financial assistance provided by the taxpayer to anyone else. That is perfectly correct. I do query, however, why compensation orders might need to be assessed by the principles set out in subsection (2). Those principles could produce a result which was not of value in any ordinary sense. Why, for example, are certain methods of valuation to be ruled out? Why is the valuer being deprived of the use of judgment in the correct methods to use? In what circumstances do the Government expect to use subsection (2)?</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09011919000005"></a>The Minister has been at pains to point out how the valuer will be appointed in an independent way, and one can only assume that the Government will ensure that the person will be of some standing, experience and competence. Under subsection (2), however, the Government can tell us exactly what to do.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09011919000006"></a>I am also troubled by subsection (4), which is familiar territory to anyone who has been involved with the Northern Rock valuation order. My problem is that if these principles are insisted upon as opposed to applied as relevant in the judgment of the valuer, it may produce a result which is not fair. Fairness was debated in another place. My honourable friend David Gauke moved an amendment in which he tried to introduce a principle of fairness into the valuation process. Unfortunately the Government did not feel able to accept that helpful amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09011919000007"></a>Let us suppose that a failing bank was hit with the special resolution regime but that the authorities were over-hasty in their judgment. The Minister will recognise that this is a concern that has been expressed in relation to the powers under this Bill; that is why we are particularly concerned about the nature of the hurdle in Clause 7, which we debated earlier. Let us suppose that the valuer finds that the bank was capable of operating as a going concern on plausible assumptions. Or let us assume that he finds that administration would not have been an appropriate basis for action. Subsection (4) allows the Treasury to specify a

If the authorities had been over-hasty, there would be a strong incentive for them to use subsection (4) in order not to let the correct position emerge.</p>

<a name="90119-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09011919000008"></a>It would be wholly inappropriate to debate the specifics of the Northern Rock case in view of the current legal action. The Minister will be aware, however, that shareholders, and not just the hedge funds, felt strongly that their assets were being expropriated and would not be correctly valued because of the application of the valuation principles which were insisted upon in that valuation order. It is not implausible that this could happen if the powers were used in future. In addition, the existence of the power of the Treasury to specify a valuation assumption, perceived by others to be unreasonable, seems likely to lead to a string of judicial reviews, if nothing else. All in all, it seems fairer and, indeed, more efficient in valuation terms to leave everything to the valuer&#146;s judgment. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response on why the Treasury needs the powers set out in Clause 57.</p>

One can imagine situations, following on from the exposition of my noble friend Lady Noakes, in which a potential independent valuer declined to bid on the grounds that they would not have true independence. That might well depend on the detail in the order.</p>

More particularly, the compensation scheme order, again set out by the Government, will presumably specify what the principles are which the independent valuer has to apply. In short, the Treasury is writing the rule book. The independent valuer is told he has to do this or that, apply average values or on specific dates, and so on. This seems to be far more restrictive than ought to be the case. The matter ought to be dealt with by the independent valuer; I should have thought that there is a well established body of opinion on how this ought to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09011919000011"></a>Like my noble friend Lady Noakes, I have some doubts with regard to subsection (4). It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="09011919000089"></a>&#147;Valuation principles may require or permit an independent valuer to make assumptions; such as, for example, that the bank&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="09011919000090"></a>(a) has had a permission under Part 4 of the Financial Services and Markets Act...varied or cancelled&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011919000085"></a>I would not have thought that this is something one makes an assumption about. I would have thought it is a fact: either such an order has been varied or cancelled or it has not. If not, I do not see that the independent valuer can then be compelled to say otherwise.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09011919000012"></a>Similarly, while I can see that one may need to make assumptions about whether a bank is able to continue as a growing concern&#151;that seems reasonable&#151;it seems odd to make an assumption about whether it is in

I would have thought it either was or was not in administration. The same applies to being wound up: I should have thought either it is being wound up or it is not. I simply do not understand what subsection (4) has to do in relation to an independent valuation of what needs to be paid to compensate those affected by the action which has been taken.</p>

The issue I have most sympathy with is whether the valuer should be required to make the determination of whether the bank would have been viable in the absence of government action. That is a decision which, under the Bill, we are requiring the FSA, in the first place, to make. The independent valuer is required to rely on the judgments that have been made but, in fact, under Clause 7, the institution will be in this process only if the FSA has determined that it does not pass, or is unlikely to pass, the threshold requirement of continuing as a financial institution. In effect, therefore, the valuer can start with the presumption that it is not a viable ongoing entity without this being spelt out by the valuation principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09011919000014"></a>The other aspects of the principles that the Treasury or others might want to put to the valuer are perfectly reasonable parts of the evidence that the valuer would be perfectly entitled to take into account. They do not need to be laid down as principles which are required to be taken into account. The problem is that, in order to satisfy the Treasury that all these principles are going to be considered, the clause leaves open such wide scope for the valuer to be dictated to that the whole notion of an independent valuer begins to be undermined.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09011919000015"></a>If this clause is to remain in the Bill, I should like to understand how the dictation of these valuation principles affects any grounds of appeal. Would an appeal be able to take account of whether the valuation principles that had been dictated were appropriate, or would it have to start from the basis that the valuation principles were outside the appeal process?</p>

I think that one matter of language could be improved. When I first read Clause 57(3), I was confused as to what was to be disregarded. The text says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09011919000091"></a>&#147;an independent valuer must disregard actual or potential financial assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury (disregarding ordinary market assistance offered by the Bank on its usual terms)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011919000086"></a>I was not sure whether this was a double negative, so I looked at the Explanatory Notes, which say, in paragraph 147 on page 22, that the subsection requires the valuer,</p>
<ul><a name="09011919000092"></a>&#147;to disregard actual or potential financial assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury (other than ordinary market assistance offered by the Bank on its usual terms)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011919000087"></a>The language in the Explanatory Notes seems clearer and would be more easily understood than the text in the Bill. It is only a small change of a word or two, but it would remove the ambiguity.</p>

I am not sure that I agree with the judgment of the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, on that point, but I will reserve my position, look at the matter carefully and act accordingly if he proves to be right.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09011919000018"></a>Several of the representations that have been made have been founded on a basis that is contrary to the Government&#146;s thinking on this clause. Although issues were raised on matters of detail, I am not too sure that we are not colliding on a matter of principle. The clause is being attacked because it is thought that it somehow compromises the independence of the valuer, which we were at pains to establish when we were discussing the earlier clause. That view has been translated into the belief that the valuer is bound to have his independence affected because of the role reserved for the Treasury in this clause. I just do not accept that. The independent valuer will be established on the criteria of independence that we discussed at length only a few moments ago, but he will work within a framework established in law, as indeed he should.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09011919000019"></a>Let me get this clear. Are noble Lords who have spoken about this critically suggesting that the independent valuer should approach the issue as if no public resources of any kind were at stake? We are talking about a situation in which a bank or financial institution is in such serious trouble that action has had to be taken. That action may have involved&#151;indeed, it is likely to have involved&#151;considerable resources of public money.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09011919000020"></a>The Government are concerned to ensure that the evaluation criteria take account not of the double negative that the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, suggested existed; there is no double negative, as it is absolutely clear what has to be taken into account. What the valuer cannot do is identify the value of the institution as if the authorities had not put in any resources to support that institution. That cannot be contended. In the evaluation procedure in this Bill, there were bound to be criteria relating to the safeguarding of public resources. I venture to say that if this Bill had been introduced by an opposition Member, opposition Back-Benchers would not be voicing criticism of this proposal, as they would be four-square with the necessity of having such safeguards.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09011919000021"></a>Of course the Treasury may specify valuation principles to which the independent valuer must have regard when conducting the exercise to assess the amount of compensation, if any, payable in respect of a transfer of powers. That is a cardinal principle behind the concept of the action that the Government are carrying out under special resolution procedures. The valuer must disregard,</p>
<ul><a name="09011919000093"></a>&#147;actual or potential financial assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011919000088"></a>to the failing bank, as to include that in the framework would make the bank look more valuable and more viable than it could possibly be if it were not for the public interest at stake because of the resources committed. That is the significant point that I want to establish with regard to these issues, although I recognise that noble Lords have made a number of additional points about the scheme.</p>

I am not at all sure that it is necessarily the case in every valuation that significant public resources will have been committed to the organisation; it is quite possible that a bank will not have received any financial assistance before being put into the special resolution regime. I said that I did not challenge subsection (3), although I accept that some of my noble friends have done so. The Minister said that some additional points had been raised. The only points that I raised were other than in relation to subsection (3), so I hope that he will respond to them.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09011919000024"></a>The Treasury may need to specify assumptions that the independent valuer must take into account in conducting the valuation exercise. These principles set out the parameters that the independent valuer must adhere to in making his determination. This in no way undermines the independence of the valuer. The European Convention on Human Rights recognises that such parameters may be established by the state in circumstances where compensation arrangements are being considered and where the state has been active in terms of public resources.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09011919000025"></a>I emphasise that I am seeking to defend properly, as I was seeking to do in relation to the earlier amendments, the independence of the valuer, while stating that Clause 57 accurately outlines the parameters within which the valuer is bound to work.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09011919000026"></a>Without the clause, the work of the independent valuer would have to take place with no principles or parameters. That would surely be open to the sharpest of criticism. I point out that the detail of the valuation principles, which will be set out in a compensation order made about a bank resolution, would be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny through the affirmative procedure. I reiterate the obvious point that parliamentary scrutiny is necessary for the order. That is an important part of the legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09011919000027"></a>I emphasise that the clause is a crucial part of the legislation. It is consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights. We have considered the provision with the greatest care. We are working within that framework. If we did not have parameters on which the independent valuer&#151;I hope that in our discussion on previous clauses we have established the independence of that valuer&#151;would act, the Bill would be severely deficient. I emphasise again how important that provision is to the Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness accepts that point.</p>

What need is there? The Minister said that valuations need parameters. Why do they need parameters?

We are talking about valuation in the context where the state has acted, and may have acted with a substantial commitment of public funds.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09011919000034"></a>In the past few months, our priorities have been, first, to prevent the collapse of the banking system; secondly, to support the economy; and, thirdly, to ensure we get lending going again. This is also a problem faced by Governments across the world&#151;and it is therefore necessary to achieve the maximum degree of international co-operation. We are taking steps not just to support the banking sector but, importantly, to safeguard the millions of jobs that could be put at risk by the continuing difficulties in the international financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09011919000035"></a>Restoring the banks&#146; ability to lend is an essential part of the economic recovery so today I am proposing further measures to meet two objectives: first, to begin  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1489"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to replace the lending capacity lost by the withdrawal of foreign banks and other institutions; and, secondly, to remove the barriers preventing UK banks expanding their own lending.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09011919000036"></a>I want to set out these new measures in the context of the strategy we have put in place to steer the country though the worst global economic crisis for generations. Over recent months, banks have faced increasingly difficult conditions, as we have seen everywhere around the world, with Bank of America rescued last week; Citigroup, one of the world&#146;s largest banks, broken up; Anglo-Irish nationalised; Commerzbank rescued in Germany and, today, the Royal Bank of Scotland reporting substantial write-offs.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09011919000037"></a>Last October, faced with the potential collapse of the banking system, we recapitalised the banks, strengthening their position. As a result, the Government took temporary stakes in two British banks but, as I said then, we have a clear view that British banks are best managed and owned commercially and not by the Government. That remains our position. As a result of the action we took, no savers in UK banks have lost money.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09011919000038"></a>In the Pre-Budget Report, I announced substantial extra help for people and for businesses&#151;lower income tax, more capital investment now and lower VAT&#151;which, hand in hand with interest rate cuts and lower inflation, will support the economy and jobs. There is a clear international consensus that putting money into the economy now to counter the recession and to help people is the right thing to do. The cost of doing nothing would be substantially greater.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09011919000039"></a>In almost every country, fiscal expansion policies have now been agreed&#151;including in Germany only last week. In the US, President-elect Obama has already signalled the scale of their fiscal expansion. But, as the President-elect said only yesterday,</p>
<ul><a name="09011919000094"></a>&#145;restoring the economy requires that we maintain the flow of credit to families and businesses&#146;.</ul>
<a name="90119-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09011919000040"></a>In the UK, the total amount of lending available still falls short of meeting the needs of the economy. Over the past 10 years, lending by foreign banks and non-bank institutions accounted for more than half of new corporate loans and 45 per cent of new mortgages here. A significant amount of lending capacity&#151;by these foreign-owned banks and specialist lenders for example&#151;has been withdrawn or has returned to their home markets, demonstrating again the need for co-ordinated international action.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09011919000041"></a>On top of that, in the past few weeks, the world economic downturn has intensified everywhere&#151;in the US, in the euroarea, and now spreading to Asia, including China&#151;all seeing weaker production, companies in trouble and fewer jobs. As we go into what will be a difficult year, dealing with this global financial crisis will need continuous effort.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09011919000042"></a>There is no single remedy; there is no instant solution. We will need a range of measures designed to support lending, help businesses and protect jobs. Together, my measures today remove uncertainty and accelerate a resumption of lending&#151;a necessary precondition for recovery here and around the world.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1490"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09011919000043"></a>There are three measures to address the capacity reduction in the banking sector. First, because of current conditions, companies are finding it harder to get loans. So the Government have today authorised the Bank of England to create, for the first time, a new &#163;50 billion fund, which will help increase the amount of funding available to companies by purchasing corporate assets from the banks, enabling them to invest. This will help large companies and complement the substantial measures announced last week by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to support small and medium businesses. This fund will buy assets from banks, financial institutions and financial markets, with finance provided by the Treasury. The Treasury is also supporting the fund with an indemnity. It will initially purchase high-quality private sector assets, like corporate bonds, commercial paper and syndicated loans, which companies use to finance their business. The assets purchased by the Bank of England will be good quality investments which will eventually be sold so that taxpayers&#146; interests are protected. This will enable larger companies to get the funding they need at a lower cost.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09011919000044"></a>The operating remit of this scheme will be set by the Government but it will be run on an independent basis by the Bank of England. When purchasing these assets, the Bank of England will ensure the total amount of money in the economy does not increase. In future, the Monetary Policy Committee will keep under review whether this facility could be used as an additional way for meeting the inflation target, in line with similar operations at the US Federal Reserve. In such circumstances, I will decide the overall scale of the scheme and I will also keep the House informed.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09011919000045"></a>Secondly, in order to maintain some of the capacity being lost in the mortgage market, I have decided that Northern Rock will no longer pursue a policy of rapidly reducing its mortgage book. In addition, looking at when the housing market recovers, I am considering whether&#151;and, if so, how&#151;Northern Rock or other UK lenders can best support prudent lending to creditworthy customers who will need mortgages but can only afford deposits less than 25 per cent.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09011919000046"></a>Thirdly, in order to ensure that RBS, which owns NatWest and a number of other banks, can continue to support lending, I am taking action to strengthen its position. When the Government purchased their stake in the bank in December, a new management team was put in place. The company have announced further losses today, many of which are associated with its investments in the US following their takeover of a Dutch bank, ABN, in 2007. So I have agreed to their request to convert the Government&#146;s stake of preference shares into ordinary shares. The Government could now own up to 70 per cent of RBS. In return for this, we have agreed with it an extension of lending commitments to large companies and an increase in lending of &#163;6 billion in the next 12 months.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09011919000047"></a>As well as taking action to maintain lending capacity, I want to remove some of the barriers and uncertainty preventing the existing banks lending further. In return for this, we intend to negotiate with each bank a lending agreement. These agreements will be specific, covering both the quantity and type of lending made  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1491"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>available to people and businesses across the country, just as we have done with RBS today. These commitments will be binding and externally audited.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09011919000048"></a>In return, banks will get access to support measures. First, under a new scheme the Treasury will insure certain bank assets for a commercial fee against losses on banks&#146; existing loans. The purpose of the protection is to allow the expansion of lending, so the pricing has to be fair and reflect all our objectives. The banks&#146; problems stem from uncertainty about the value of their assets. Faced with this uncertainty, individual banks are reluctant to lend to businesses and companies. This will reduce the banks&#146; exposure to risks and give them the room they need in order to lend more. We will insist on the highest international standards of public disclosure and transparency in the operation of the scheme. Countries all over the world are considering similar proposals. We will work with them to take action together.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09011919000049"></a>The second step towards removing barriers to lending is an expansion of the funding capacity of financial markets. The credit guarantee scheme I announced in October will be extended beyond its current end date of April this year. Instead, it will run until the end of 2009, subject to state aid approval. This scheme guarantees new unsecured borrowing. So far over &#163;100 billion of these guarantees have been taken up. These guarantees have been successful in helping bring down the interbank lending rate from 6 to 2.25 per cent. To complement this, the Bank of England will continue to provide similar types of liquidity support when the special liquidity scheme expires at the end of this month. Until recently, up to half of UK mortgages were funded from the wholesale markets. At the time of the Pre-Budget Report I accepted the recommendations in the Crosby report on mortgage finance markets. I have announced that the Government will provide up to &#163;50 billion of guarantees, initially on new mortgage lending and eventually on other assets. Overall, the liabilities taken on will be backed by financial assets and fees will be charged for guarantees and insurance, safeguarding the taxpayers&#146; interests.</p>

<a name="90119-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09011919000050"></a>Thirdly, the Financial Services Authority has today set out its policy on capital requirements. It has set out the level of capital that individual banks need to keep on their books to allow them to withstand the slowdown and maintain lending. It will be a key signal that banks should allow their capital to be used to absorb the losses from investments, while not unnecessarily restricting their lending.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09011919000051"></a>The regulation of capital is fundamentally an international matter and tomorrow I will present our plan to European Finance Ministers in Brussels. I hope we can agree similar proposals there. Because this financial crisis is affecting every country in the world, it is crucial that other countries also take steps to support their banking sectors. We cannot risk a damaging worldwide spiral of weakened confidence and national-only policy decisions. Stronger international collaboration will be strengthened with the arrival of the new US Administration. We must not give way to financial protectionism which could be every bit as damaging now as it was to trade in the 1930s. Instead, we must look at the causes of this international financial

We must strengthen the supervisory and regulatory system here and internationally. I shall publish proposals on the regulatory framework for the banks in the spring together with the FSA&#146;s own review. Internationally, we will be actively pursuing this as part of our presidency of the G20 through 2009. Our objectives in the G20 will be to continue to take action jointly to support the world economy, to act together to restore the flow of credit and to improve the international regulatory regime. This is a continuing effort. Countries all over the world are united in supporting their economies, maintaining lending and protecting jobs. We are ready to do whatever it takes&#148;.</p>

I also thank the Government for finally recognising, de facto if not in terms, that their action last October was far from sufficient to save the banks, let alone to save the economy or, to use the Prime Minister&#146;s memorable phrase, &#147;to save the world&#148;. The Government accompanied their October announcements with a lot of fierce words about banks resuming lending. The banks did not do so. The lack of credit in the economy is accelerating the depth and length of the recession in which we find ourselves after a decade of irresponsible and reckless economic management. Of course there is a global banking crisis but the way that it is hurting our economy is a direct result of economic management, or indeed mismanagement, of the last decade. So we start with an economy that is not well prepared for a downturn and this has been exacerbated by a lack of credit to support it. Instead of concentrating on credit, the Government embarked on futile gestures, such as the VAT reduction, which has had absolutely no impact. So we must be grateful that the Government are now focussing on the real issues.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09011919000054"></a>We support much of what has been announced today, though with some provisos. We have argued for a long time that the use of preference shares carrying a coupon of 12 per cent was counterproductive in the original package. It positively worked against increasing lending. At least the RBS will now be freed from that. The Minister said nothing about the similar millstone around the neck of Lloyds TSB/HBOS. Will he do so? Is it that Lloyds TSB does not want any more equity shares to be held by the Government, with which we could have some sympathy? If so, what will that mean for Lloyds TSB&#146;s lending?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09011919000055"></a>What impact will today&#146;s Statement have on government borrowing and debt figures, which are already at record levels? To put it another way, how much more taxpayers&#146; cash will be paid to the banks? The asset purchase facility appears to involve further borrowing of &#163;50 billion. How much else is involved? Related to that, will the Minister say more about the Bank of England asset purchase facility? We are told that this is to buy high-quality corporate debt, but investment-grade borrowers have access to finance at the moment; the problem is borrowing below investment grade. How will this affect the borrowing for corporates that are below investment grade?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09011919000056"></a>The first &#163;50 billion will be funded by Treasury bills, but this morning&#146;s announcement opens the way for the MPC to use asset purchases for monetary policy purposes. Will the Minister confirm that this means that the Government are opening the way for quantitative easing, or, in ordinary parlance, for printing money? We can see that, in extremis, quantitative easing may be necessary, but it will be the most damning indictment of the Government&#146;s handling of the economy if it comes to that.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09011919000057"></a>Secondly, how is the MPC involved in this? The committee has no control over the Bank&#146;s printing presses. Do the Government intend to change the monetary policy remit of the Bank of England? If so, how, and when will they do so? What mechanisms will be involved, and, more importantly, what involvement will there be for Parliament?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09011919000058"></a>On the contingent liabilities that will come with the Statement that the Minister has repeated, will he say how much is at stake for the taxpayers in a worst-case scenario? There are virtually no figures in the Statement. The Chancellor denied on the radio this morning that this was a blank cheque, but how do we know, because the Government will not give the figures? Is there any limit on the amount that will be exposed in the economy as a result of this Statement?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09011919000059"></a>We have concerns about the open nature of the plans that have been announced today. I have some detailed questions for the Minister on the asset protection scheme. The press release that was referred to this morning talked about information on the assets being made available to the Treasury, but no mention was made of such information being made available to Parliament, and since this is an open-ended commitment, it is important that proper information is set up. We have called for a full and independent audit of what the taxpayer is now being asked to ensure. What is being done to value assets before their risk passes to the taxpayer?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09011919000060"></a>The vehicle for the asset protection scheme may well be an entity that is established or designated by the Treasury. We have seen with UK Financial Investments how the use of a special vehicle that is set up by the Treasury lacks a specific statutory accountability framework, which means that what happens within that organisation can be very difficult for Parliament and others to track. Will the Minister commit to ensuring that full accountability of that body to Parliament is established? The Statement this morning was not stuffed full of detail; nor was the Minister&#146;s repetition of it. It is clear that much still remains to be decided. When will full details of this scheme be made available?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09011919000061"></a>The test of this package will be whether credit is restored to the economy, but it is important that lending is realistic and not of the reckless variety that helped the banks to get into the mess that they are in. Most commentators believe that the valuation of the housing market has not yet reached its trough. To what extent is it not reckless to encourage individuals to start borrowing again when values are still going down? The Statement referred to Northern Rock starting to lend again. I am not at all sure that using a state-owned bank that was not known for prudent lending practices is a particularly good vehicle for that, but will the  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1494"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister say what instructions the Government are giving to Northern Rock on its lending criteria and how much they will allow it to lend?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09011919000062"></a>More generally, allowing mortgage-backed borrowing by the banks, as recommended by Sir James Crosby, will be acceptable only if it means meeting the standards of transparency and quality that the Government set out today. The Minister said that &#163;50 billion will be available. How does that compare with former volumes of mortgage-backed securities? What impact will this have on the market? We would be concerned if this scheme were so large that it led to a return to the price inflation and lending criteria that got the banks into this mess in the first place.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09011919000063"></a>Lastly, the Statement referred to the FSA&#146;s separate statement on capital ratios. Will the Minister explain the reference in that statement to amending the variable scalar method of converting internal credit risk models? Will this allow the banks to reduce their risk-weighted asset requirements, as commentators have suggested, and hence to reduce the amount of capital that they are required to hold? Does that not leave the way open for our banks to become even riskier than they are already?</p>

It is, however, a very depressing Statement, because it makes it clear that the banking system is in even greater crisis than was apparent in the autumn, that it is creating a real economic crisis of alarming and growing proportions, and that the first bail-out was completely inadequate. We obviously hope very much that this bail-out is more successful. The Statement, however, gives rise to as many questions as have been answered, and I hope that the Minister will not mind if I ask him a few questions now.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09011919000065"></a>The Minister points out quite correctly that there has been a dramatic fall in the capacity of the banking system because the foreign banks have largely withdrawn their lending. Have the Government assessed the quantum of lending that has disappeared from the UK financial sector, and has that figure informed the amounts by which they are now asking the banks to increase their lending?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09011919000066"></a>Secondly, will the Minister confirm that the &#163;50 billion of net assets that are being available will be funded by an increase in government borrowing? As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, this is another &#163;50 billion to add to the ledger. When he says that the Monetary Policy Committee will keep under review whether this facility could be used as an additional way of meeting the inflation target, can he explain what on earth that means? Again, as the noble Baroness asked, can he explain whether we will need an amendment to the Bank of England Act to change the MPC&#146;s formal remit to do that?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09011919000067"></a>We welcome the fact that Northern Rock will no longer pursue a policy of rapidly reducing its mortgage book. Does that mean that it will carry on reducing its mortgage book, or will it seek to increase it, given that the Government will encourage it and other lenders, in a manner about which we are yet unclear, to make mortgages available to those who can afford deposits of less than 25 per cent?</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1495"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09011919000068"></a>The Government now own 70 per cent of the RBS. Does that not mean in effect that it is a nationalised bank, and would it not be more straightforward to turn it into a state bank so that the borrowing and lending policies that it pursues can explicitly follow public objectives? The RBS is in a slightly bizarre situation in that the Government are directing it to make specific policy changes to its lending while professing more generally, and certainly in the context of the Banking Bill, that when they take shares in banks&#151;and particularly when they take over a bank&#151;they will do so at arm&#146;s length. They profess this; yet we have a detailed proposal from them on how the RBS will extend its lending activities in the future.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09011919000069"></a>On the other banks covered in the Statement, the Government have undertaken to negotiate a lending agreement with each bank. Will all the banks agree to such a lending agreement? What will the sanction be if they do not? There is a problem in reaching these agreements and putting in place the new scheme to insure, as the Government coyly put it, &#147;certain bank assets&#148;. How do you value these bad assets? Values in, for example, commercial property are still plummeting. When the Government say that countries all over the world are considering similar proposals around bad assets and that we will work with them to take action together, are they seeking to find a common basis for valuation? Or are they just going to have a chat with all the countries doing similar things?</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09011919000070"></a>On capital adequacy, it seems that the FSA and the Government have accepted that the current capital adequacy rules are inadequate. Are they in effect tearing up the bar rules unilaterally, or is the Chancellor going to Brussels tomorrow to ask that they be revoked, set aside temporarily or replaced? It is not clear from the Statement.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09011919000071"></a>Finally, what in broad terms does it mean when the Government say they will publish proposals on the regulatory framework for the banks in the spring? Might they, for example, be contemplating a Glass-Steagall approach, or is this just a raft of technical issues?</p>

I will do my best. This is an important announcement, following the announcements made in October that were highly effective in reassuring customers and depositors of British banks of the strength of those banks and their ability to honour their commitments.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09011919000073"></a>Contrary to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, banks have continued to increase their lending in a number of important areas. In the various meetings I had over the weekend with most of the chairmen or chief executives of our British banks, a number expressed considerable confidence about the outlook for lending in the United Kingdom. This is in the light of action taken by the Government&#151;in both the Pre-Budget Report, as a consequence of lower interest rates and, importantly, because of the measures we announced this morning.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1496"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09011919000074"></a>The noble Baroness questioned whether we were in a strong enough position economically to cope with these extraordinary changes. I remind noble Lords that these are global challenges. As I and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have said, there is no economy in the developed world, or indeed in the major developing economies, which is not now experiencing significant contraction in output and demand. Yet in six of the past seven years the United Kingdom was either the strongest growing or second strongest growing economy in the G7. Over the past 10 years, we achieved the highest growth in GDP per capita in the G7. We approach these challenges from a position of considerable strength after the achievements of the past decade.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09011919000075"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the Lloyds Bank Group and the &#147;millstone&#148; of preference capital. The preference capital was agreed with the board of Lloyds. It may well reflect on changed circumstance and wish to talk to the Treasury and the UKFI. If it does, those representations will be received.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09011919000076"></a>On the impact of today&#146;s Statement and in particular the amount of cash that is going to the banks, the strong feature of this announcement made by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is that it involves little cash. The exchange of preference shares for ordinary shares is a non-cash item. The attachment of guarantees in accordance with Crosby is a non-cash item. The extension of the discount window facility at the Bank of England is a non-cash item. The extension of asset protection through an insurance scheme is a non-cash item at first. It may be a cash item in due course; that would depend on the experience of the insurance policy and would have to be offset against the premium received.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09011919000077"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether we are giving a blank cheque to the banks. That is not the case. On the contrary, establishing the asset protection scheme will take six to eight weeks. It will involve a huge amount of data analysis. I envisage well over a billion items of individual data reviewed for each bank that approached us in that connection. We will be drawing on the support of external advisers&#151;accountants, actuaries and lawyers. We will determine appropriate attachment points based on value-at-risk calculations and ensure that the premium reflects the risk, taking into account the lending commitments we would receive from the bank as a consequence.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09011919000078"></a>The Bank of England asset purchase facility will involve investment-grade bonds. The noble Baroness lives in a different world from me in her assertion that investment-grade corporations have no difficulty obtaining loans. That is simply not the case from the contact I regularly have with the finance directors and chief executives of major companies. The appetite for banks to lend to major corporations has deteriorated substantially. The measures we have taken will address that.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09011919000079"></a>This is not a prelude to quantitative easing, but it creates the architecture that would be needed for that. If the Bank of England and Monetary Policy Committee conclude that that is the right thing to do, an appropriate framework will be set in place. That would include an exchange of letters between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Monetary Policy Committee. The

There will not be a need to change the Bank of England Act.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09011919000080"></a>There were observations about the lamentable record of Northern Rock management, disregarding the fact that the management of Northern Rock has changed. The current instruction to the board of Northern Rock is that it should no longer regard its asset book as in run-off.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09011919000081"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked for data on the extent to which foreign banks&#146; withdrawal is impacting on the availability of credit. It is quite significant in particular sectors of the market. The withdrawal of the Icelandic and Irish banks, the ending of securitisation and a general retreat to home which tends to happen in these circumstances have meant a serious reduction in credit availability. This programme is designed to address that.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09011919000082"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether the Royal Bank of Scotland is now a nationalised bank. No discussions with the Royal Bank of Scotland have ever discussed nationalisation. The Chancellor was clear in his Statement to the other place that he regards our banks as best owned in the private sector. However, with the board of the Royal Bank of Scotland and other shareholders, we have commenced a programme to improve the quality of management and leadership there. Noble Lords will no doubt have seen the appointment of Sir Philip Hampton to join Mr Stephen Hester as respectively chairman and chief executive of that bank.</p>

<a name="90119-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09011919000083"></a>Questions were asked about the Crosby review and the guarantees. Again I remind noble Lords that the attachment of guarantees to residential mortgage securitisations does not involve a cash payment. It enhances the quality of the credit and is a non-cash cost. Crosby was very clear that he did not believe that this programme would create any costs for the Exchequer, but rather would be a source of income. We have also committed, as a part of this programme, to ensuring that London becomes a centre for a new form of securitisation that departs from the weaknesses and failures of the last, which did not have appropriate disclosure or risk sharing.</p>

Issues around asset valuation are primarily for boards of directors and external auditors to address. Nearly all our major banks have a December year-end, and they will now be going through the process of completing their accounts. The Royal Bank of Scotland made it clear that its announcement this morning of quite frightful losses was a consequence of that work. It is absolutely incumbent on boards of directors, particularly chairs of audit committees and external auditors, to be clear on the need to be honest about the state of the assets they own.</p>

The losses are so huge that frankly we do not know what they are, and indeed I am not sure that anyone knows. Certainly I am not sure that the directors of these banks, their auditors, Ministers, or anybody else can answer questions about values because we know what has happened in the past. Clean certificates were issued by auditors but, days or perhaps weeks later, billions were written off. The situation is so incredible that it is hard to believe. If we do not know the figures, is not there a real danger that guaranteeing the banks could be self-defeating in the sense that once the bad and slow payers know about it, they will become even slower so that situation is even worse, and we will see real bad debts, not possible bad debts?</p>

We assume that that is the end of it, although one begins to doubt if it will be. I appreciate their desire to leave the running of these banks to at least some bankers, although again, I am not sure which ones. Can the Minister tell us whether any of those bankers who decided to buy ABN AMRO and now have to write off God knows what&#151;&#163;10 billion or &#163;20 billion&#151;are still going to be allowed to run their banks at arm&#146;s length? Is it really the case that the running of banks in which the taxpayer has more than a 70 per cent interest as well as interests in the form of guarantees and insurance is going to be left to those self-same bankers? Is that really the Government&#146;s decision?</p>

I remind noble Lords that very significant changes have been made to the leadership of that bank. A new chairman is to be appointed and a new chief executive is in place. Two or possibly three of the executive directors have left, and there is a general agreement that the board needs to be further refreshed. Certainly, very serious questions need to be asked not only by the board of directors and the senior management of some of these businesses, but also by institutional investors who, from my recollection, voted&#151;inasmuch as they voted either for or against the acquisition of ABN AMRO&#151;by a margin of over 90 per cent in favour. Noble Lords will no doubt recall that a competition was held for the ownership of ABN AMRO. Barclays

Valuation is not a precise exercise, as we discussed very recently in the context of the Banking Bill, but there is no excuse for failing to address valuation. When it comes to providing insurance, we will form our own views on valuation; that is, we will take a bank&#146;s data and form our own views on how much of the risk we will take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09011933000007"></a>My noble friend&#146;s penultimate observation was on the danger that these policies will encourage people to be even slower in making payments. We will structure them so that we take what insurers refer to as the tail risk. The first or primary risk will rest with the banks, which will also take a proportion of the tail risk. They will continue to have an equity interest in ensuring that the existence of the insurance does not in itself lead to any moral turpitude.</p>

<a name="09011933000008"></a><b><a name="90119-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011933000132"></a>Lord Lamont of Lerwick:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the Statement and I hope that it will remove some of the uncertainty that prevents banks lending to each other. I want to ask the Minister about the insurance scheme for bad past investments made by banks. On the radio the Chancellor said that the objection to the bad bank solution has been rightly rejected because it requires evaluation of these bad debts, which would take too long. Yet here we are with a solution that is going to take time and requires the valuation of those bad assets.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09011933000009"></a>Secondly, while the insurance scheme is a lot cheaper than the horrifying costs of the bad bank solution, it is not quite a non-cash item as the Minister suggested. The costs will build up over time and could be very significant. If the Minister cannot respond to my noble friend Lady Noakes about giving a cost now, will a cap and a cost be given at the point when the insurance scheme is put in place?</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09011933000010"></a>Thirdly, how long might an insurance scheme last? I know that the &#147;bad bank&#148; solution has disadvantages, but one advantage would have been that it created certainty and got the assets off the balance sheet. The insurance scheme cannot last forever, so is it not the case that it has very considerable uncertainties attached and that, because we need full declaration and certainty, it may not do the trick?</p>

I did not hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the wireless, so I will not comment on what he said. The problem with the terminology &#147;good bank, bad bank&#148; is that it oversimplifies. The principal challenge in separating assets out into a new institution is that it would need separate funding, and there would need to be absolute agreement on the value of assets. If the Government paid too much for these assets it would be gifting value to the banks; if it paid too little, it would further diminish the capitalisation of the banks.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09011933000012"></a>The attraction of an insurance proposal, as opposed to the sale-and-purchase model of &#147;good bank, bad bank&#148; is that there is continued equity as far as the bank is concerned. To the extent that it does not need to call on the insurance and that the value of those assets improves, and they perform better than current expectation, it will continue to retain all the interest in those assets, less the premium it has paid for the insurance. I believe that I said clearly that the insurance was a non-cash item at first. It could be a cash item later, but might not be; that would depend on the efficacy of the insurance policy.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09011933000013"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Lord&#146;s best informed comment. The duration of the policy will be important, because we need a policy that will take financial markets through this economic downturn and beyond the next cycle, so we are probably talking about a policy duration of no fewer than five years and probably no longer than eight or nine years. In terms of the ultimate structure of the policy and the scale and value of assets covered, I imagine that matter will be disclosed publicly, not least by the banks, which will, in some cases, need shareholder approval to enter into the contracts. I commit that the Government will make available details of the broad nature, scale and coverage of those policies when they are entered into, should such policies be written.</p>

<p><a name="09011933000111"></a>I am somewhat puzzled by that, because there is widely felt concern about small businesses and the Royal Bank of Scotland has particularly portrayed itself as their supporter. Can the Minister clarify exactly what is meant by,</p>

I believe that although there is considerable concern about the availability of credit to smaller companies, the initiatives announced at the time of the pre-Budget review, which my noble friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform expanded upon, have considerably eased the anxiety among smaller companies about the availability of credit.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09011933000018"></a>As I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, there is concern about larger companies as well. That is why the Royal Bank of Scotland willingly volunteered this extension in our discussions on Sunday. I repeat my earlier comment: over the weekend a number of banks expressed a step change in their confidence toward the availability of credit and profitable lending opportunities, as a result of the steps that have been taken, here and globally.</p>

Is the Minister aware that I invested my modest savings in the national Bank of Ireland? There was then a series of takeovers, and I ended up with the Royal Bank of Scotland, which I had no desire to have any connection with whatsoever. In desperation, I then left the Royal Bank of Scotland and went to Coutts, which I thought was a safe haven. The next minute, I found that Coutts was taken over by the National Westminster which, after a short time, was taken over by the Royal Bank of Scotland, so I was back where I started.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09011933000020"></a>The gravamen of my question is: what will happen to those banks which, like Coutts, have hitherto had a proud record of independence? They have also had the great privilege of not only my membership but that of Her Majesty, whose interest is probably marginally larger than mine. What will happen now that Coutts bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland? What will the Minister do to safeguard the interests of the innocent who put their trust in financiers?</p>

I am not sure whether many of my noble friends on these Benches were directors there, but it shows what an open party Labour is when casting its net into the areas from which it captures its supporters. Coutts is one of a number of subsidiary banks of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank in Ireland being another, for example. I can reassure the noble Lord that Coutts is, in my experience, a fine bank to bank with. It enjoys the same protections that apply to any other bank in the United Kingdom. Regardless of whether it is a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, it has a good board of directors&#151;chaired by a Member of this House&#151;and has, I believed, always exhibited cautious and conservative lending policies. No doubt that was one of the things that attracted the noble Lord, Lord St John of Fawsley, to it.</p>

It is clear from the Statement that bank credit is contracting in the economy, both because, as the Minister said, foreign banks have disappeared from the economy and because UK banks are having to de-gear their balance sheets for both capital and liquidity reasons. Some of that decrease in lending may simply reflect the fall in the value of previously overvalued assets but we are all concerned about whether there is enough credit in the economy to support the genuine needs of business. As we look at these various packets of &#163;50 million, &#163;100 million, &#163;200 million and add them up, is there behind that a government view of what level of credit they are trying to achieve to support the economy and whether these measures will achieve that?</p>

We believe it will make a significant contribution. I wish I could give the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, a more precise answer but there are a number of variables. Just as my doctor keeps telling me that there are two types of cholesterol&#151;one of which it is all right to have and another which is not&#151;there are two types of users of credit. There are many users of credit, for instance, in the world of hedge funds and speculation where, quite frankly, a de-leveraging of that kind of credit does no economic damage; it is the credit availability to the real economy that matters. We also need to take into consideration the global factors and the extent to which the process of banks retreating into their home markets continues to be a significant factor. The extent of credit that would need to be supported by government programmes is, to some extent, a response to certain factors that we have to take into account. We believe that a serious, comprehensive, integrated proposal is right to support the British economy in this global challenge and to make credit available to hard working British families and to British business.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09011933000026"></a>&#147;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a further Statement to the House on Gaza.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09011933000027"></a>From the outset of the conflict, the UK has called and worked for an immediate ceasefire. I know from questions last week that the whole House will have felt enormous relief when on Saturday night Israel halted its military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday when Hamas stopped its rockets. Our relief at the ceasefire is matched by our distress that it has taken so long to be achieved. The respite has come too late for too many.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1503"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09011933000028"></a>A ceasefire, as Security Council Resolution 1860 made clear, was always going to be the essential first step. We urge Israel to complete the withdrawal of its troops from Gaza with all due speed. Hamas must put a definitive end to rocket fire at Israel. That is why the Prime Minister travelled to Sharm el-Sheikh and Israel yesterday to join other world leaders in starting to embed that ceasefire and ensure it becomes the durable and fully respected ceasefire that we&#151;and the Security Council&#151;have called for.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09011933000029"></a>In the 22 days of the Israeli offensive over 1,200 have died and we are yet to know the full extent of the destruction. But horrific accounts and images already fill our news bulletins and we can be sure that life for Gazans, already grim, has become desperate. Systems for power, sewerage and food distribution are broken or under acute strain.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09011933000030"></a>Meanwhile, rockets have reached further than ever from Gaza into Israel. Israel has lost nine soldiers.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09011933000031"></a>The Gaza crisis has reverberated around the world. There have been large demonstrations in the Middle East but also in the West. The conflict has also been used to whip up hatred, including in this country, and I am sure the whole House will want to send a very clear and cross-party message that we all denounce the anti-Semitic attacks that have taken place and vow to work for their elimination.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09011933000032"></a>We are faced with two immediate challenges: stopping the flow of arms and starting the flow of aid into Gaza. In respect of trafficking in arms, as the Prime Minister announced yesterday, we are ready to play our part. The immediate security responsibility lies with Egypt but the origin of these arms stretches way beyond the Egypt-Gaza border. This is where international help aimed at interdiction, using intelligence and a range of military assets, is important.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09011933000033"></a>But it is not just arms that are smuggled. The closure of the crossings has also created a thriving illegal trade in necessities, which has filled Hamas&#146;s coffers without providing Gazans with the basics they require. Hand in hand with closing of illegal traffic must go a vast increase in legal traffic. The immediate priority is to meet the desperate humanitarian needs. That means not simply food and medicine but, for example, sanitation equipment. Then there are all the supplies which are required to repair Gaza&#146;s ruined infrastructure and return power and water. The Government have pledged a further &#163;20 million on top of the &#163;6.8 million we pledged earlier in the conflict. British charities have raised millions more.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09011933000034"></a>The Prime Minister made clear in Egypt and in Israel that reopening the crossings will be vital. The 2005 movement and access agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority should provide the framework. We are ready to help, including by reinstating and, if necessary, extending the EU Border Assistance Mission at the Rafah crossing.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09011933000035"></a>Smuggling and the crossings will be at the heart of the discussions this Wednesday evening when all 27 EU Foreign Ministers meet with Foreign Minister Livni, and on Sunday evening when we meet our Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Turkish counterparts.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09011933000036"></a>However, the critical actors in securing progress, never mind peace, are the Palestinians themselves. Full humanitarian reconstruction will be impossible unless accompanied by political reconstruction. Unity in Palestinian politics is vital to so many things: to rebuilding Gaza, to holding elections, to delivering peace. It is for President Abbas to lead this process. The Arab League and Egyptian commitments of November last year point the way forward.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09011933000037"></a>At a time of enormous loss for Palestinians, one thing should not be forgotten: Palestinians on the West Bank did not respond to Hamas&#146;s call for a third intifada. In fact, the Government of Prime Minister Fayyad in the West Bank showed clearly in their management&#151;political, economic, security&#151;that, given half a chance, the Palestinian Government can be hugely effective and provide a real partner for peace.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09011933000038"></a>At the UN and last week in this House, I said the Gaza crisis was a symptom of political failure. To avoid its repetition we need a political process. The Arab League showed in its letter to President-elect Obama in December that it was serious about its ground-breaking offer of peace embodied in the Arab Peace Initiative: the creation of a Palestinian state in return for Arab normalisation of relations with Israel&#151;a genuine 23- state solution.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09011933000039"></a>The challenge is to ensure that this Gaza crisis does not simply provide another grim milestone in an endless conflict. As we help Gazans rebuild their lives, we must find a way to ensure that this is the last time they will have to do so. That means showing serious progress towards a Palestinian state alongside improved Israeli security. It means a peace process where closed door negotiations are buttressed by Israel and the Arab world taking steps to support rather than undermine the peace process.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09011933000040"></a>But anyone who doubts that peace in the Middle East requires the full, intense engagement of the international community only needs to look at the streets of Gaza today. International engagement that is full and intense includes the immediate engagement of the new American president and Administration. President-elect Obama and his Secretary of State designate, Hillary Clinton, have made clear that they understand the urgency and are committed to act. It will certainly be the first topic when I speak to the new Secretary of State this week.</p>

<a name="90119-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09011933000041"></a>Palestinians and Israelis will be asking themselves whether they are fated to permanent conflict. I know that I will have the support of the whole House in doing everything possible to avert this future&#148;.</p>

Clearly, this must involve mechanisms to prevent weapons-smuggling into Gaza. Will the Minister be more specific about how weapons-smuggling through tunnels will be prevented? As part of the ceasefire arrangements, the Prime Minister has apparently offered Royal Navy support. The nature of this support is unclear. Will the Minister be more specific about this? What impact will it have on the many competing priorities of the Royal Navy, which now has so few frigates and destroyers? The Falklands guard ship has just been taken away to east Africa, so there is only one frigate covering west Africa, the West Indies and the Falklands. How can a single ship shuttle between these places and have any effect? Much as the Royal Navy would like to take on this commitment, it is hard to see how the Prime Minister is in a position to offer it, certainly for any length of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09011933000046"></a>It is vital that we help to ensure that there is a quick and effective aid supply to the people of Gaza.

We welcome the announcement that Britain will make available an additional &#163;20 million in humanitarian aid. What steps will be taken to ensure that the severe constraints on the ability of humanitarian workers and supplies to reach the population are quickly addressed? In particular, what technical assistance will be needed to restore the basic infrastructure and prevent the spread of disease?</p>

<p><a name="09011933000113"></a>is far too limited. We have to get back to a much more active peace process that addresses not just Gaza, but the future of the whole of historic Palestine, or historic Israel, and which involves all interested parties, inside and outside the region, and therefore has to find some way of bringing in Hamas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09011933000052"></a>For Israel, this has been a tactical victory and a strategic defeat. We all recognise that Israel has lost the sympathy of public opinion across much of the western world, and has further undermined its claim to moral authority. I spent some time last week talking to a number of Israelis about what their preferred end game was for the Gaza conflict, and was frustrated to discover that nobody could tell me what the Israeli strategy was. Mr Netanyahu said that the aim had to be to destroy Hamas. However, if one does destroy Hamas, who runs Gaza? Does the Minister know how we can reconstitute Gaza without the engagement of the political wing of Hamas?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09011933000053"></a>Some Israelis would prefer to bring in Fatah again, under the approval of Israel&#151;disastrous for the future reputation of Fatah on the West Bank, and of Hamas, it seems to me. Others in Israel say, &#147;Gaza should be nothing to do with us in future. Open the Rafah crossing and push Gaza onto Egypt&#148;. The Mubarak regime is clear that that would threaten to destroy the Egyptian regime, with potentially disastrous results for Israel. Others accept that perhaps no one would end up running Gaza, and out of the chaos, an even more radical terrorist wing would emerge.</p>

They have been too close to the Bush Administration in their dying days, and too biased towards Israel after its disproportionate and self-defeating use of force. Having watched our Prime Minister at his press conference in Israel&#151;an image that undoubtedly has gone to Al-Jazeera and the whole of the Arab world&#151;one worries about the hatred issue. There is, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, real concern about encouraging anti-Semitism in this country. However, encouraging hatred of the West across the Arab world must be deeply against Britain&#146;s long-term interests, and we have to be concerned about that, as well.</p>

<p><a name="09011933000114"></a>&#147;A Palestinian state&#148;? We need the Palestinian state foreseen in the road map, within secure boundaries, which I suspect have to be close to the 1967 boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09011933000058"></a>It is the same situation with talk about stopping the flow of arms to one side. Those of us who remember the Bosnian conflict recall that an arms embargo disadvantaged one side in a deep and bitter conflict.

It talks about the contribution that we and others will make to rebuilding Gaza again. Who else will be asked to pay? Will the Israeli Government, as well as Arab Governments, be asked this time to contribute to the rebuilding of Gaza, which must be part of rebuilding a viable economy in the Palestinian land, one of the necessary bases for the negotiated settlement for which we all desperately wish but from which we are now further than we were three weeks ago?</p>

We on these Benches agree completely with that view&#151;this is a start, but no more than that. We must move quickly to bolster what is obviously a fragile ceasefire.</p>

<a name="90119-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09011933000061"></a>I shall take the points in order. The issue of the tunnels and the boats is a critical early step to get right because it is a confidence-building step for at least one side. I do not pretend that we yet have all the answers. Egypt has always maintained that as the sovereign power at one end of the tunnels it should be responsible for security in that regard and has never expressed much enthusiasm for an international force in that function. With regard to the boats&#151;there is a big debate about how many of the arms come in by land and how many come in by sea&#151;that is an area where the international community can make more of a contribution, hence the Prime Minister&#146;s offer. It is certainly his expectation that it would not just be the UK but that a group of countries would provide boats if that were useful. Again, though, a whole series of questions need to be thought through about the right of interdiction at sea, the legal basis on which the boats would be operating, and many other issues. These are spontaneous initial responses to the situation and offers made in great seriousness to try to move this thing forward, but an effective regime of controlling arms smuggling, either underground or by sea, must be urgently developed. We will play whatever useful role we can in that, within the limitations of our military and naval capacities, as was pointed to by the noble Lord, Lord Astor.</p>

<a name="90119-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09011933000062"></a>Both speakers said that we cannot stop there. Equally important in this first phase is ensuring that the crossings are opened. Here there may well ultimately be a role  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1508"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for an international monitoring force, under either the UN or some other international flag&#151;there is some experience of that already. It must involve all crossings in order to ensure that adequate humanitarian access is achieved and that the economy of Gaza can be restarted. The level of destruction, as we have started to see today in the footage from journalists who have been able to regain access to Gaza, is truly horrendous and goes well beyond easily moved supplies such as food, medicines and water to fundamental infrastructure materials, a large volume of which needs to be brought in over a considerable period of time.</p>

<a name="90119-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09011933000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, expressed concern that the Arab peace initiative will not be there for ever. It seems like a long time ago, but before this dreadful conflict in Gaza started the Foreign Secretary toured the region, trying to build support for the Arab peace initiative. That was the main thrust of David Miliband&#146;s Middle East visit, now six or seven weeks ago. He and the Government believe that it remains as important now as then, but it is right to say that it will not remain on the table for ever. A cost of this conflict is a polarisation and radicalisation of opinion in the Arab world as well as other places, which means that moderates have difficulty in holding on to their ground. If we are to move forward with the initiative, we must do so quickly.</p>

<a name="90119-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09011933000064"></a>That takes us to the question of who runs Gaza and the role of Hamas in the political process. It is primarily, as the Statement said, for Palestinians to determine who runs Gaza; there must be a political process that will resolve the differences between the two Palestinian groups, Fatah and Hamas. There remain several ways that the Palestinians could choose to move that forward. One is to reunite again under the banner of the Palestinian Authority, which recognises the state of Israel and has sought a peaceful means to resolve these conflicts. If the authority became a unifying Government for the two halves of the Palestinian community, that would be a way forward. There is speculation among Palestinians that it may be easier to move to elections and elect fresh leadership. Ultimately, though, the Palestinians must resolve how to come together in a united way and negotiate not just with Israel but with the international community as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09011933000065"></a>If I may, I shall defend the Government and our Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. Perhaps I am looking at this from the other end of the measuring stick, in a sense, but it seems that the Government have tried to show even-handedness in this conflict and we have not fallen into the trap of blind support for one side. The negotiation of the UN Security Council resolution, in which we played such a leading role, reflects that, and Israel&#146;s anger at that resolution demonstrates that if offending both sides is the measure of neutrality&#151;or if not neutrality, at least some balance&#151;then it was a much better performance than that of several years ago, when the charge that there was not balance quickly enough in British policy in 2006 perhaps had more truth to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09011933000066"></a>On the arms issue, we want to stop a conflict that began because the Israelis were reacting to rocket attacks on their cities. We therefore want to prevent a revival of those rocket attacks, so preventing the resupply

There is inequality in arms supply; there is no way around it. Israel has a large domestic arms industry of its own. As I have assured the House before, we have sought, in the limited arms exports that we allow to Israel, not to export material that we think can be used to kill civilians or indeed can be used for repressive means. We will continue to review that policy, which has subsequently been reviewed in a judicial process that confirmed that it was living within the objectives set for it. However, I do not mean to detract from the argument that these issues of military supply and balance are key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09011933000067"></a>I turn to the final point that was raised, the reconstruction and who will pay for it. I was pleased to hear today that the Saudi Government are contributing $1 billion to reconstruction, and I hope the Gulf countries will play a leading role in that. However, as I have said before in this House, and I think this is a widely shared sentiment, how many more times do we have to rebuild Gaza? There is an obligation on the parties to this conflict to bring this to an end and stop the shameless cycle of reconstruction and destruction.</p>

I have three brief points. First, will the Government make it clear that the taxpayers of the world cannot be expected to repair and replace the wanton damage caused by Israel to civilian and United Nations premises? Israel, surely, should initiate a worldwide Marshall plan for both Gaza and the West Bank. Secondly, given that the present ceasefire is not necessarily permanent, and that there is still no agreement about crossing points, will the Government insist on access by sea to Gaza for relief and emergency supplies? Ships carrying such supplies should, if necessary, be escorted by NATO and other allied navies. Finally, will the Government ensure that tankers carrying pure drinking water by sea to Gaza, to prevent widespread kidney disease and other diseases caused by polluted supplies, can get there?</p>

Israel, too, has a responsibility in this. That is absolutely correct. However, equally, we cannot make the reconstruction a political football when people are in need and their lives are at risk today. We have to start this and, once more, it will be those with a reputation for generosity in such humanitarian activities who, I fear, will get a large portion of the bill. It is worth it; lives that have been so deeply jeopardised by recent events will be saved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09011933000070"></a>As to access from the sea for humanitarian supplies, the UN Secretary-General has sent a humanitarian assessment mission to the region and a DfID Minister, Mike Foster, is also there looking at the humanitarian issues. We will need to wait and see what is the best way to achieve the supply that we all want to see on an urgent basis.</p>

Many of us want to put on record our appreciation of the very constructive part played by the Secretary of State and indeed by the Minister of State himself and other members of our Government. Does my noble friend accept that this is only a very fragile ceasefire? As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, has said so well, getting on with the job of renewing the peace process is urgent. If that peace process is to be meaningful and to have any chance of fulfilment, is it not essential from the outset that those involved are drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible, and that we avoid the mistake&#151;repeatedly made in the past&#151;of limiting negotiations to those with whom it is convenient to negotiate? Is it not essential to be prepared to talk to those with whom it may be very difficult to talk?

The peace process does need to be expanded. In the Statement the Foreign Secretary used the phrase &#147;23-state solution&#148;. That reflects the idea that we need to get the whole Arab world&#151;friends and not such friends alike&#151;involved if we are to get a durable peace that will hold for all. Equally, I confirm my noble friend&#146;s second point about the urgency of access.</p>

Clearly, immediate humanitarian aid should have priority. Does the Minister agree that rebuilding the economy of Gaza is vital and urgent? I do not only mean rebuilding it to its position before the bombardment, when around 50 per cent or more of Gazans were unemployed, but rebuilding it to a much more normal position. The Statement seemed to say that we will work for full political agreement before trying to rebuild the economy. That is almost the wrong way around. We need a Marshall plan of an enormous kind for the economy of Gaza. As the Minister said, Saudi Arabia is promising $1 billion and is hoping to raise another $1 billion from the other Arab states quite shortly. We should back them up to get the economy moving, almost regardless of politics. That means opening the crossings&#151;particularly into Egypt&#151;and sea wharves in full for trade, and, as soon as it can be arranged, the airport, to which the Minister referred the other day. Freeing the economy and allowing the people to work and earn will make the politics much easier. The effect of Israeli actions in beggaring its neighbour has made the situation infinitely more difficult.</p>

I must say that I have come to the reluctant conclusion not that the politics has to follow the economics, but that&#151;at

How does the Minister think that we can continue to keep the international spotlight on this? Does he not see this as a very dangerous moment? Is this not a much more dangerous conflict even than previous ones? If we do not keep that international spotlight on the Middle East, we will be in a very serious situation. Following what was said earlier, how do we ensure that the Gazans are not simply imprisoned again, that a port and an airport are open and that the Gazans are able to trade freely?

At the end of the Lebanon conflict in 2006 a Security Council resolution was adopted with a much fuller set of stages for building the peace than Resolution 1860. It laid out a whole series of territorial and disarmament objectives, which were meant to be reached in sequence. Most of that sequence has been honoured in the breach rather than the achievement because once a kind of peace settled back down, monitored by UN peacekeepers, the pressure on the two sides to resolve these difficult issues dissipated and fell away. We must make sure that the same does not happen to Gaza. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, is absolutely correct. We have to ensure that we push through and get these political arrangements locked in and agreed to as quickly as possible. I hope that a new American Administration will become part of dealing with that.</p>

The offer as regards interdiction at sea did not come out of the blue but emerged from discussions with a number of parties, including the Israelis, the Americans and others. I think that it will enjoy widespread support. I hope that it will happen under an international flag and that a number of us will combine to make it effective.</p>

If we talk to only one of these two parties, it begs the question whether they are both more or less representative in the West Bank and Gaza respectively. In so far as I understand where the Government are going, they both ought to be at any round table meeting and we cannot require prior agreement between them.

We have to find a way for the Palestinians to come together in a way that allows them to engage with the international community as well as to negotiate with Israel. I laid out two possibilities for that: to reunite under the flag of the Palestinian Authority and President Abbas in a way that created a united Government to whom the international community could talk and who met broadly the conditions of the quartet principles; or, as an alternative way of arriving at this point, to offer the potential prospect of elections. Both options are being discussed among the Palestinians. However, I cannot assure the House that it is as straightforward as my noble friend has suggested and that we shall instantly be able to sit down around a seminar table with the two Palestinian leaderships equally represented. That kind of statement would be highly inflammatory in this context. We have to understand that we need to work to arrive at a point where we can deal with the whole Palestinian community,

First, I agree very much with my noble friend Lord Cope that the economic aspect must come first, even before the political one, although I understand that the political discussions are ongoing. Secondly, does the Minister agree that if Hamas could be persuaded to drop from its charter the desire to destroy Israel completely, that would very much help the thinking of the Israeli public and Government? If and when the border crossings are opened, I should be very much in favour&#151;I hope that the Minister agrees with me&#151;of them being policed by a joint force to ensure that Israel acts properly and that the people coming out of Gaza, and goods going into Gaza, are properly handled.</p>

<a name="90119-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09011933000087"></a>My final point is slightly off the wall. We have been talking a lot about the tunnels and the arms smuggling. Is it not a worthwhile idea to sink a deep trench along the &#147;Philadelphia corridor&#148;, with the permission of Egypt, and flood all the tunnels from the Mediterranean Sea?</p>

I have already said that the economic and political aspects need to proceed in parallel, but we certainly need to accord enormous importance to the economic aspects. As regards Hamas dropping the destruction of Israel from its charter, the quartet principles, which also call for the renunciation of violence, are the principles we have always required of Hamas before it participates in negotiations, or we participate in negotiations with it. As has been discussed, we need to find a way to move forward and not fall back into the previous arid stand-off. We must find a way of bringing Hamas forward, ultimately as part of a united Palestinian delegation, into negotiations on a final peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09011933000089"></a>On the border crossings, it is clear that two issues require to be addressed. The first is the need for some kind of international presence to ensure access. There is also the issue of how the Palestinians manage their side of these border accesses.</p>

Does the Minister therefore agree that the British Government have a duty to warn Israel about the stage it has reached with this monumental mistake

This is the equivalent of Israel&#146;s Sharpeville. Gaza will now be remembered throughout Arabia as Israel&#146;s Sharpeville. The whole tone has now changed towards Israel in that whole area. This is tragic as it is unfair on the millions of moderate, decent Israelis who want a settlement and a two-state solution. Will the British Government remind the Israeli Ministers&#151;some of them inept and incompetent to a degree which understandably caused the fury and rage of Gerald Kaufman in another place in Thursday&#146;s debate, despite the histrionic language&#151;that they have a solemn duty to resume these negotiations with the Palestinians as quickly as possible, whatever the structure may be, to ensure that Hamas is included? It is absurd, is it not, to exclude Hamas from these processes to create that state as quickly as possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09011933000092"></a>The negotiations with President Abbas were going on far too long with no results at all, and no one lifted a finger in the EU part of the quartet or in Britain to protest to the Israeli Government about the lack of response on their part. Does the Minister agree that this must now surely be done as quickly as possible? That means accepting the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg&#151;we are both friends of Israel, but we have somewhat different views on the way to achieve outcomes&#151;insisting that Israel immediately opens all the crossings on the Israeli side into Gaza.</p>

The process had taken much too long, it was much too dilatory, and it was not getting anywhere. There could be no better lesson to all of us&#151;Israelis, Palestinians and all of us in the international community&#151;that this neglect of international negotiations does not lead to a static situation; it leads to one of potentially enormous, overwhelming tragedy and violence.

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="09011933000096"></a><b><a name="90119-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09011933000169"></a>Lord Harrison:</b> My Lords, the automotive industry is suffering acutely from the global downturn. Its precipitous decline in the past six months is charted in an excellent Commons research paper that was published at the end of last week. But bad news comes not as single spies but in battalions: Honda has just announced that it is standing down workers until the summer, illustrating the quickening pace of the decline. So tonight it is right that we debate why and how the Government might help this key industry. I start by asking my noble friend what today&#146;s timely announcement on banking means for the car industry, especially the &#163;50 billion set aside for businesses?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09011933000097"></a>Let us remind ourselves that this is an inherently successful industry on whose coat tails other suppliers, dealers, R&amp;D professionals and entrepreneurs thrive. It is an industry that is totemic of the best of British manufacturing. Those gainsayers who characterise the modern British automotive industry as unreformed as the lumbering American car industry, or as a head case left over from the 1970s, are simply wrong. Some 73 per cent of cars and vehicles made in Britain are sold abroad as exports, principally into Europe. They are so sold because they are first-rate products, competitively priced and supplying a real market, either as volume producers&#151;where Nissan in Sunderland has been Europe&#146;s most productive plant&#151;or as producers of executive or specialist vehicles. The recent history of Bentley at Crewe is one such unparalleled success. To fail to help an industry that is currently suffering a lack of customers, short on ready finance, would be to punish a reformed and thriving industry that is well placed to resume successful sales once the credit crunch is crushed.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09011933000098"></a>Professor Garel Rhys of the Cardiff Business School believes that the downturn will last until 2011. Does my noble friend accept this and agree that it would be madness to dissolve the industry&#146;s core of skills, knowledge and expertise, hobbling its resumption of successful sales when the downturn ends? Given that the market lacks customers, not products, does my noble friend agree that we need to stimulate the supply side rather than the demand side? Customers are there, but they lack access to reasonably-priced finance. In talking to the banks over the weekend, was the automotive industry specifically mentioned? What was decided about loan guarantee schemes and how they might be applied here? Given the banks&#146; reluctance to lend, but their apparent readiness to lend 8 per cent disbursals outside the UK, have the Government considered guaranteeing banks making loans direct to plants themselves, or indeed should the Government make direct loans themselves to the plants? Will my noble friend confirm that there has been a genuine difference of opinion on this issue between BERR and the Treasury on how to help?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09011933000099"></a>I am not advocating throwing good money after bad, but this dynamic industry needs help during the temporary drought of customers. Interestingly, venture capitalist Jon Moulton also believes that financial aid may be the wisest course, recognising the cost and misery of abandoning broken communities at the heart of industrial Britain. Of course, the Government must adopt a case-by-case approach for assessing claims on the public purse. Those cash-rich companies, such  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1516"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as Tata on Merseyside and Honda in Swindon, should shoulder the burden of interim funding themselves, and do so for their own very good and sound commercial reasons. Does my noble friend agree?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09011933000100"></a>The Government have already been active in dealing with the downturn, but the temporary reduction in VAT to 15 per cent is perhaps of marginal worth in respect of the domestic car market. After all, 86 per cent of automobiles sold on the domestic market in Britain are imported, and the net saving of 2.13 per cent on VAT&#151;not 2.5 per cent&#151;is not a compelling incentive; indeed the fact that CitroÃ"n dealers offer to pay the total VAT on sales to customers suggests just that. The VAT cut will, of course, help domestic sales of the 27 per cent of cars made here in the UK and, in turn, this will give some succour to hard-pressed car dealers.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09011933000101"></a>Europe is the principal market for Britain&#146;s automotive exports and imports. Can my noble friend report on the meeting in Brussels last Friday, which was convened by Commissioner Verheugen to co-ordinate a rational approach to shared problems? My noble friend Lord Mandelson has warned member states to avoid self-defeating protectionism. Nevertheless, France, Spain, Sweden and Germany have already devised national plans. Are HMG fully engaged in swapping innovative ideas with our partners? For instance, Germany&#146;s short-term Kurzarbeit initiative, where wages are being paid by the Government for up to 18 months to ensure that key workers remain in place ready for the upturn, is worthy of examination. Are we actively stealing such good ideas?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09011933000102"></a>Does the UK support the European Investment Bank&#146;s proposed &#163;40 billion facility available to the automotive industry? As I understand it, member states are permitted to give help to their domestic plants to facilitate government guarantees to maintain their liquidity and investment. However, the Finance and Leasing Association believes that such finance is restricted only to promoting new energy-efficient schemes. What is the truth? Are we fully on board? The EIB also proposes supporting skills updating, R&amp;D and so on. Are we sympathetic to those?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09011933000103"></a>In the longer-term, what is Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s view of membership of the single currency? How much better off we would now be inside the single currency, rather than exposing ourselves to the violent swings in exchange rates that so impair rational business planning for the automotive industry. Nor can we remain deaf to the criticism of bosses of our Japanese-owned plants, who are frustrated that Britain&#146;s absence from the eurozone weakens their access to the single European market.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09011933000104"></a>Half the jobs in the automotive industry are found in components firms. They, too, need tailored help. Does my noble friend acknowledge that many of them are small firms lacking the in-house personnel to tap into the current raft of excellent government schemes aimed at honing core skills, encouraging R&amp;D and promoting innovation, as well as repositioning the industry to face the challenges of producing low-carbon emission cars and the environmentally friendly vehicles of the future? Will my noble friend say how Government might improve knowledge and confidence for these

Selective assistance and finance for investment in England initiatives are complemented by many others, but do those firms for which those schemes are designed know of their existence? Can my noble friend report on the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team, the useful supply-chain group&#151;will its life be extended?&#151;and on the Foresight Vehicle group and the National Skills Academy for Manufacturing? These should be nurtured during the downturn.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09011933000105"></a>The influential SMMT called for government action, including special liquidity arrangements for manufacturers&#146; finance companies to access money through banks, scrapping plans for increased vehicle excise duty and a new first-year rate, increased capital allowances for fleet buyers, and the temporary shelving of plans to reform business car capital allowances. Are HMG sympathetic?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09011933000106"></a>Finally, the FLA is a body representing motor, asset and consumer finance providers working through independent non-bank lenders and subsidiaries of manufacturing companies. Am I right in believing that these companies do not have access to the Government&#146;s finance schemes announced last October? Will HMG extend the eligibility criteria of the Bank of England&#146;s special liquidity scheme and the Debt Management Office&#146;s credit guarantee scheme to such lenders?</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09011933000107"></a>In proposing this debate, I had hoped to touch on many important issues for the future, but tonight we must concentrate on the matters of the moment. We must address the problems and consequent opportunities of the moment; namely, the survival of a successful industry bringing pride and jobs to Britain. If we fail in our task, there will be no automotive industry to talk about, and we will all be the poorer.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09011933000109"></a>According to the noble Lord, 86 per cent of all cars are foreign imports. I would not argue with that. On the day that I joined the Ford Motor Company, the figure was 2 per cent, and that was nearly made up of top-end Mercedes. What went wrong in July 1964? The first Harold Wilson Government went wrong. They came in and decided that they had to cure the economy of what they perceived as a credit crisis&#151;we should all be so lucky today&#151;by imposing stringent controls on the purchase of cars. There was a maximum of 18 months to pay, with a 50 per cent deposit, and no one could sell a car for two years. Worse still, at the end of that two years, when the controls were taken off, there was no back-stock of vehicles that were ready and waiting to be bought. The only cars available were those coming from Japanese and Korean manufacturers which flooded the market. The British motor industry never recovered and was ruined from that day on. We owe it something now at this exceptional time to try to put it right.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09011933000110"></a>What could we do? One thing would fulfil a lot of what the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, was talking about, but would not actually require the extent of government subsidy and support he asked for. We could perhaps relieve a little of the Government&#146;s burden by repealing the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If this were to be done, you would immediately open up the way again for the banking community to provide secured lending for motor cars, and that would effectively remove the need for much of the guarantees that the banks had received and give them an incentive to become more aggressive in lending for cars, as opposed to anything else in the community. It would provide the necessary financial fuel to kick-start the motor industry again. If it takes one or two years for the whole crisis to be resolved, such a measure would have a profound effect by the end of that period. We could probably tweak it a little bit with some additional government support. Firms such as Tata could go down the path of olden times, whereby they could provide their own forms of credit plans. That would give them another profit incentive. It would be a really big initiative that would cost us nothing and would have a huge effect.</p>

That would cause already-constructed vehicles to be sold and credit to become available again to enable those sales to take place. Many people will have delayed purchasing during the commentator-enhanced start of the recession, and they will be anxious to require a replacement for their current vehicle, which they have held on to for rather longer than they had initially planned. Car manufacturers will need to slow down their rate of production&#151;several have taken breaks in production&#151;otherwise, there will be ever-increasing fields of unused cars, which it may be questionable to call new cars.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09011938000006"></a>So far, I suspect that the Minister will go along with me and give limited assistance. My preference would be for any government support to be prioritised on cleaner and smaller cars. To be really tough, we should only accept group A and group B engines that emit up to 120 grams per kilometre. We should refuse to allow car engines to exceed 2 litres in capacity. Moderation may allow for the inclusion of group C cars, which emit up to 150 grams, to obtain a good ratio of petrol engines to diesel engines and avoid overuse of either fuel, and to achieve a balance for the refineries.</p>

Britain and Germany should abandon their big-car, company-car culture. The Government can help by not assisting car builders that build larger cars. At the same time, work is required to improve batteries, to increase all-electric urban vehicles and hybrids, and to promote LPG vehicles, unless supplies of LPG and propane are being used up at an appropriate rate. The public can assist in this move to cleaner cars by being properly informed about the various rates of vehicle excise duty and, hence, fuel

I declare an interest as a former chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, when it and I were greatly involved in the strengthening of the automotive industry within Wales in particular and the UK in general.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09011938000010"></a>At the outset, I remind your Lordships that the link between the UK automobile product and the UK consumer is relatively weak. As noble Lords have heard, 75 per cent of total UK production is exported, while 85 per cent of total automobile purchases are imported. Therefore, stimulation for the purchaser alone could well aid overseas-based companies more than those here.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09011938000011"></a>I suggest that a more effective way to address the severe cash-flow and inventory problems confronting our manufacturers would be to provide loan guarantees to the individual corporations, rather than to provide guarantees to the banks. This course of action could be criticised for putting the Government or their agencies into a position of choosing winners, but so be it. I should prefer that to having the banks at this stage determine to whom they loan.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09011938000012"></a>As we have heard, the motor industry in the UK is of significant importance to the economy. The Ford engine plants at Bridgend and Dagenham are recognised by their global management as exemplars of best practice, and they produce 25 per cent of Ford&#146;s worldwide engine requirement&#151;a major export. However, as your Lordships have heard, Nissan and Toyota in the UK are consistently numbers one and two in the European productivity league, as measured in output per worker, and not far behind them on the pan-European scene is UK-based Honda. BMW Mini is outstanding, and in productivity terms the Ellesmere plant is one of General Motors&#146; best performers, if not the best, in Europe. At the other end of the market, the ex-works value of the output of Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin in 2007 was equivalent to some 250,000 Superminis. One can see here the impact of high value-added manufacturing.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09011938000013"></a>More than 50 per cent of manufacturing employment is in automotive components and systems, largely of course in SMEs, where greater job losses have already been recorded than in the main assemblers. As an example, Honda has announced a four-month shutdown at Swindon but continues to pay its employees basic rates. SMEs cannot afford such luxury and have to make redundancies, as they do not have that financial muscle.</p>

There should be such a solution, otherwise we will be in danger of attracting unfair competition in the industry. Above all, we have to retain our skills. We have heard of the Kurzarbeit in Germany. I hear that France is already talking of &#8364;1.5 billion of support and the Germans of &#8364;800 million. All these measures are designed to retain skills, and that is the most important thing that we can do in the next 18 months to two years. We must retain the skills of this significant industry so that we are ready for the recovery, when it comes.</p>

I declare an interest in that I work with the Sector Skills Council, about which I shall speak.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09011938000016"></a>The automotive sector in the UK makes a significant contribution to the economy. With an annual turnover of around &#163;50 billion, the sector directly employs 158,000 employees on around 3,300 sites and supports more than 700,000 jobs in the supply chain. Within that chain, 82 per cent of businesses employ fewer than 50 people. Annually, 1.7 million cars and commercial vehicles are built in the UK, together with more than 3 million engines. The biggest global players all have manufacturing sites in the UK. These companies&#151;the top-tier automotive supply chain companies&#151;along with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the trade unions, have come together under the umbrella of the Semta automotive sector strategy group to champion the development of skills and business improvement across the sector.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09011938000017"></a>Government have already pledged, under the sector compact, &#163;65 million of support for the companies within the Semta footprint in England. Forty-five automotive companies have already taken up this offer and the target of 200 companies is to be achieved in the first year. This funding is addressing the need for upskilling at levels 2 and 3 in particular, with first and second NVQs available, as well as leadership and management development, all-age apprenticeships and skills for life. The funding is clearly assisting companies to train and upskill in large numbers. For example, for Toyota, Honda and Jaguar/Land Rover, training in business improvement techniques is part of a drive to improve the bottom-line performance of those companies and, alongside that, to qualify their workforce. Furthermore, specific programmes are being developed by the National Skills Academy for Manufacturing so that the automotive sector can meet the current demand for the rapid deployment of world-class upskilling.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09011938000018"></a>However, during these difficult times, wider and deeper support is needed for the vehicle manufacturers and their supply chains. The number one assistance that the sector requires to save jobs is access to affordable business finance. This would greatly assist sales with more attractive loan rates for the consumer, the stocking of showrooms and, for the OEMs, more investment in new technologies and R&amp;D.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09011938000019"></a>In terms of incentives and assistance for the sector to keep people employed during the downturn, employers would like to see an urgent extension of sector compact and Train to Gain support in the following ways: management and leadership grants widened to cover all sizes of companies; 100 per cent funding for level 3 qualifications for all occupations; a broad range of level 4 qualifications to be supported, including, for example, design engineering skills where there is a shortage; wage subsidies also to be available to large companies to save jobs; and an extension of the SME &#147;bite-size chunks&#148; offer to large companies.</p>

<a name="90119-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09011938000020"></a>At my meeting last Friday with all the major motor manufacturers, it was clear that the focus that the Government have placed on the industry is much appreciated, but they are desperately anxious that this commitment is delivered &#147;like tomorrow&#148;. Semta and the SMMT have joined voices to ensure that all automotive employers know about and can easily access available support. Their next joint meeting will be on 28 January and more than 150 employers will be in attendance. This would be a great opportunity for the Government and their agencies to respond to the needs of the industry.</p>

I identify very much with his tribute to the importance of this industry and its excellent record in manufacturing in this country. I declare my interest, as listed in the register, as a non-executive director of the Vardy Group of Companies, which includes motor retailing among its many activities.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09011938000022"></a>Coming from the north-east of England, the main focus of my interest is the wonderful Nissan company. It came to the north-east of England in 1984, courtesy of the efforts of my noble friend Lady Thatcher. It has had a tremendous impact upon the north-east of England. It is the largest car plant in the United Kingdom and the most efficient in Europe. Last year it exported 75 per cent of its output through the port of Tyne to 45 countries, and Russia is its largest market. Its emphasis on lean manufacturing and continuous improvement has improved the competitiveness of more than 300 suppliers in the region. It is estimated that 56 per cent of manufacturing jobs in the north-east region are linked directly or indirectly to Nissan. The current lead model, Qashqai, has been Nissan&#146;s most successful model ever.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09011938000023"></a>This is borne out by the outstanding leadership team at Nissan who have taken some very tough decisions over recent weeks in securing the long-term competitiveness of the plant. It behoves the Government and all policy-makers to see what they can do as well. The proposals I want to put forward are not aimed at bailing out a failing manufacturer&#151;far from it. Nissan is an outstanding success story and is more than able to stand on its own two feet. My proposals are aimed, rather, at freeing up the market.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09011938000024"></a>Most vehicles are purchased from manufacturers by retailers using finance companies, such as Renault or Ford Finance, rather than banks. Trade finance from these sources, however, is drying up and desperately

I do not see that either the loan guarantee scheme announced last week, which is aimed at small business, or the special liquidity scheme announced today aimed at existing car loans will necessarily do this. In his Statement to the House on business support last week, the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, noted that this,</p>
<ul><a name="09011938000134"></a>&#147;is above all a credit crisis&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011938000123"></a>He said that it was impacting companies whose,</p>
<ul><a name="09011938000135"></a>&#147;business models are not flawed, but the credit crunch has drastically reduced the amount of capital available&#148;. [<I>Official Report</I>, 14/01/09; col. 1225.]</ul>
<a name="90119-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09011938000025"></a>I totally agree with that analysis. Why, therefore, are the Government persisting with the failed policy of the VAT reduction? The projected cost of the reduction was &#163;12.5 billion over a 13-month period. If it was scrapped now, that could release &#163;8 billion to go towards tackling the real problem of credit availability.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09011938000026"></a>Finally, the Government may care to consider the following idea. In Germany, Italy and Spain, scrapping incentives have been introduced for manufacturers. Under these schemes, high-polluting old cars qualify for a special grant of about &#8364;2,000 when they are traded in for new energy-efficient vehicles. That is good for the economy and good for the environment. Will the Government explore the feasibility of introducing such a scheme here?</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09011938000027"></a>The message is that Nissan was and is a world-class car manufacturer and through carefully targeted stimulus packages we will ensure that it continues to be so.</p>

He was foremost in supporting the industry, not least in Ellesmere Port, Wirral, the home of the General Motors Vauxhall Astra production. This plant is important, not only to the economy of north-west England, but to north-east Wales and to Deeside especially. We in Wales do not want the collapse of any work in neighbouring Wirral. There is immense travelling to work from north-east Wales to Wirral and vice versa.</p>

The Deeside engine plant was built to time and many hundreds of people now work there. Sadly, however, Toyota UK has declared this year that an &#163;88 million new engine development for Deeside in north-east Wales is to be postponed. Nobody in the company, in the workforce or in Deeside took pleasure in this announcement. It is a body blow to a most successful management team and workforce active in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09011938000030"></a>Toyota on Deeside has been superb in training employees, in supporting our county council of Flintshire and in helping dozens of local charities and voluntary organisations.

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09011938000033"></a>The House has heard a great deal about the current state of the car industry. The issues have been debated thoroughly in the press and here today. I concur with what other noble Lords have said and, in the brief time available, I shall not add to their analysis.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09011938000034"></a>We have fantastic inward investment companies producing cars in Britain. Toyota, Honda and Nissan are efficient companies that produce superb cars, which are usually designed in their home country. We are lucky to have their manufacturing facilities here and should support them. For these companies, the problem is one of consumer credit. If they cannot access credit, they cannot offer loans to consumers. If the consumers cannot get loans, they will not buy cars. If consumers do not buy cars, factories close or go on short time. We can and should break this logjam, but we must go further.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09011938000035"></a>For the last 20 years, we have heard about the importance of the service sector, the knowledge-based economy, sunrise industries et cetera. Less has been said about the need for a vibrant manufacturing industry. Much of this is the fault of manufacturing itself. The 1970s and 1980s were not a good advertisement for British manufacturing. Due to lack of investment, poor management and a weak skills base, the British car industry was virtually wiped out by competition from Japan. France and Germany faced the same foreign competition but were more successful in their response. They restructured their industries with state support and developed new products that appealed to consumers, using their local, indigenous companies. We find the same success at home. The aerospace industry received government support through launch aid and other channels. It used the opportunity to develop better products and became a very successful exporter.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09011938000036"></a>The car industry is facing huge challenges over the next decade, from emissions to safety regulations, and a new generation of high-tech but low-carbon cars will be required. The companies that best meet these global needs will grow as the world emerges from recession. We have a unique tactical opportunity. As our products are high quality, we exported over a million cars in 2007, an increase of more than 7 per cent. In fact, we exported &#163;170 billion-worth of manufactured goods, which was more than half of total British exports. With sterling at current levels, we have the chance to see our exports and European market share grow in the short term. However, for growth to continue beyond the narrow horizons of currency traders, short-term advantage must be supported by long-term investment. Investment for the future requires access to capital today. We need a level playing field with our competitors in Europe and the United States.</p>

However, it may not be able to sustain this investment if its access to capital is choked off by the banking crisis. We must act so that progress in our car industry is not endangered by failed speculation in the financial sector. British-based manufacturers should be offered loan guarantees so that they can secure finance to fund innovation and research. They must then invest here to develop new products with British suppliers, so that we have a vibrant British manufacturing base.</p>

I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, for calling this debate and particularly for referring to the importance of the small business sector. Of course the automotive industry is important as an exporter&#151;it accounts for 11 per cent of this country&#146;s exports&#151;but it is also important in that we are talking not only about big companies but about the small businesses that feed them. The success or failure of the automotive companies therefore impacts throughout the country. For example, Jaguar Land Rover employs some 15,000 people but reckons to support a further 60,000 jobs through suppliers and dealerships.</p>

That minibus has a number of components, such as a lift for a wheelchair, raised and lowered steps and so on. An automotive vehicle is made up of a number of components and provides jobs elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09011938000042"></a>In this connection, we have all been dismayed by some parts of the financial sector, but Jaguar Land Rover says that its managers will not receive any bonuses this year.

There is a possibility of increasing loans to carmakers, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, from the European Investment Bank, according to the European Union Industry Commissioner. Money should be used from that source and others for investment and restructuring rather than just for keeping the operation going. I hope that we may have a response and clarification from the Minister on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09011938000048"></a>The importance of the motor sector is so much greater than that of the manufacturers alone, because it extends to suppliers, to whom several noble Lords have referred, small businesses, in particular, to which the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, and others referred, as well as to the motor finance industry, to which my noble friend Lord James of Blackheath referred. This is not exclusively a credit-crunch phenomenon. Our trade deficit in motors has doubled over a dozen years. Jobs in the industry fell by nearly 40 per cent over 10 years from 1998.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09011938000049"></a>Last year, frustrated by lack of government support for UK industry, Rolls-Royce located a new testing facility in Germany, rather than Derby. An executive told the FT that the Germans value manufacturing, that there is better productivity and that they have a better education system. The Government have chosen not to be competitive. Britain has caused that industry to export its capabilities.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09011938000050"></a>The Government's response to current problems has been both to dither&#151;the Secretary of State was said to be considering what to do as long ago as November&#151;and to make life more difficult. The rise in excise duty bands, for example, will affect nearly three-quarters of cars, which will do nothing for demand.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09011938000051"></a>Ministers often try to paint this party as the one of inaction, but its dithering shows that it is Labour that is truly worthy of that title. What we need now, rather than ineffective VAT cuts or unconditional bail-outs of specific industries, is affordable credit for viable companies&#151;not just small companies, but all companies, including the motor companies.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09011938000052"></a>The scheme announced on Wednesday extends only to companies with turnover of up to &#163;500 million. I am sure the Minister will be able to tell us how many of the auto manufacturers I mentioned earlier that will help. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, asked what  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1526"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this week&#146;s announcements in the banking industry mean for the auto industry. It has been rumoured that, as we have been demanding from these Benches for two months, the loan guarantee scheme will be extended to larger companies. There is a specific onus on the Royal Bank of Scotland, but as my noble friend Lord Bates said, it is unclear if the whole scheme extends to larger companies, and if it does, whether it will be on a sufficient scale. When we proposed our loan guarantee scheme, the Chancellor said that it would be &#147;an empty promise&#148; and,</p>
<ul><a name="09011938000136"></a>&#147;would not help the British economy or the people of this country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/12/08; col. 1229.]</ul>
<a name="90119-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09011938000053"></a>Yet it was strongly supported by the leading trade bodies and commentators. All Ministers could do then was rubbish it, yet here they were on Wednesday proudly announcing a pale imitation of it.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09011938000054"></a>I join other noble Lords in asking the Minister most importantly if the loan guarantee scheme will be extended to all companies, including Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin and the others, and if so, on what scale. Secondly, while the extension of the special liquidities scheme to consumer car loans is welcome as far as it goes, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, asked, will the Government give the non-bank motor finance companies full access to the recently announced liquidity and guarantee schemes? And thirdly, when will the EIB money for R&amp;D, which their German and other competitors have already accessed, be released to our auto companies?</p>

I registered 14 specific questions in his informed intervention; I hope, therefore, that he will forgive me if I fail to capture all of them tonight. He can rest assured, as can others, that those that are missed verbally will be returned to in writing.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09011938000056"></a>I welcome this opportunity to respond to the comments made. I listened to the intensity of the debate and the strength of feeling, as well as the significance of the challenges. The House should be very clear that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is extremely focussed on all of these issues, on the importance of this sector and on its reach into the economy, both geographically and into other businesses. I apologise to noble Lords for being a pale imitation of my noble friend Lord Mandelson, of Hartlepool and Foy, who is currently on a trade mission to India. As I listened to this debate, I was rather wishing I had taken up his invitation to join him. However, I know the issues facing the sector are at the forefront of my noble friend&#146;s mind and his travel schedule. In addition, while he is in India, he is scheduled to meet many leading business women and men, including Ratan Tata, to discuss how industry, including the automotive industry, is faring during this difficult period.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09011938000057"></a>With the exception of the interventions from the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, most of the comments were around the vicious and unfortunate consequences of the triple  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1527"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>jeopardy of the lack of consumer credit&#151;the lack of availability of finance; the negative effect that has on demand&#151;the lack of availability of customers; and the negative effect that has on production and, thereafter, long-term and secure employment.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09011938000058"></a>The automotive sector is very important to UK manufacturing, as many speakers have made clear, with major inward investment from the global car companies that provided employment for 180,000 people in 2007, along with over 550,000 in the retail business and an estimated further 200,000-plus in the supply chain. It contributes &#163;10 billion of added value to the UK economy, exporting &#163;25 billion worth of vehicles and parts in 2007. The automotive sector was a significant part of the R&amp;D sector, spending over &#163;1.4 billion. Those numbers and many of the comments about how this industry has reformed and put itself into a position of international competitiveness challenge the final comments of the noble Lord about the failure of this Government to create an industry or support it into real health.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09011938000059"></a>The issues with which we are dealing are the issues of today and of today&#146;s markets. They are also the issues of simultaneous structural and cyclical change, which is a feature of many markets with which we are currently dealing. We are fortunate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, made clear, to have six of the top 10 vehicle makers and 19 of the top 20 automotive parts makers with a manufacturing presence in the UK, and&#151;we meet them daily and weekly&#151;companies that wish to stay in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09011938000060"></a>I recognise that the new car registration figures for 2008, which were published by the SMMT on 7 January, were disappointing, and that the trend seems likely to continue for the immediate future. I note the SMMT&#146;s anticipation of a drop in sales from approximately 2.4 million cars in 2007 to approximately 1.7 million in 2009, although I think it is generally recognised in the car industry that 2007 was, as it was described to us, a bumper year. The bar may be set higher. Nevertheless, that is a significant drop.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09011938000061"></a>This is not just a UK problem. While registrations in this country were 11 per cent lower than in 2007, they fell by 18 per cent in the United States of America and by 28 per cent in Spain. The shortfall in customers, in demand and perhaps in consumers&#146; views of the value and type of motor car that they wish to have is changing. It is very real and it is very widespread.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09011938000062"></a>The declining demand and the reaction to the current economic climate have necessitated action by employers, as many speakers have made clear this evening. We saw this recently in the job losses that were announced at Nissan. Further difficult decisions will be necessary to secure future success. As my noble friend Lord Mandelson said, while current demand for cars is hit by the recession, demand at its levels in 2007 is unlikely to return for some years, if ever; so the industry as a whole will have to adapt, not only in Britain but in Europe and worldwide, to a somewhat more constrained and perhaps differently configured market. That will have implications for the size of the industry and its individual companies and whether they restructure and consolidate.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1528"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-0013.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09011938000063"></a>This feature of excess capacity is not unique to the automotive sector, as noble Lords know; it is common across many sectors that are facing simultaneous structural and cyclical decline. None the less, this is a sector with a strong future, and here in Britain we are determined to ensure that the car sector remains a permanent and important part of our manufacturing base.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09011938000064"></a>We have been talking frequently and in much depth to the industry. My noble friend Lord Mandelson and Ian Pearson met the main automotive trade association and representatives of industry in late November to hear at first hand about the particular issues affecting the automotive sector. The key issue raised by the industry in meetings with us was the issue that was raised by most noble Lords this evening: namely, access to credit for companies for investment in new green products and greener manufacturing technologies for their supply chains and for consumers who wish to buy new types of cars.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09011938000065"></a>The industry provided a variety of suggestions and further information, which we have been considering carefully. What have we done so far? In addition to the measures announced today by my colleague in another place, which are designed to ease liquidity and reduce the downside risk of insurance, and to schemes relating to asset purchases, there will, in answer to questions asked this evening, be greater clarity about how those will operate, provided through an exchange of letters between the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England at the end of this month.</p>

<a name="90119-0013.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09011938000066"></a>Moreover, my noble friend Lord Mandelson unveiled &#163;22 billion of funding to unblock the credit markets, which will make it easier not only for small companies but for those with a turnover of up to &#163;500 million to access credit. In answer to the question asked by my noble friend Lord Harrison, we anticipate that the automotive supply chain will benefit in particular from the working capital guarantee scheme. We have successfully lobbied for the European Investment Bank to double to &#8364;8 billion the support for investment in greener cars and manufacturing processes, although I register that that is not the &#8364;40 billion that the car industry requested, and we are pushing for the bank to speed up its processes.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90119-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90119-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09011938000067"></a>We have undertaken a targeted communications campaign. My colleague the Business Minister Ian Pearson wrote to all the major car manufacturers outlining what support may be available to their suppliers. On the difference of scale and scope of smaller firms, we have tried to make it clear that the larger players in industry and trade associations have a real responsibility to ensure a necessary level of knowledge cascading through the industry. As we unveil new schemes we will ensure there are ongoing communications and that point of clarification is continued.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09011938000068"></a>Despite the scepticism voiced this evening by some noble Lords, we have scaled back the fees on vehicle excise duty and reduced VAT. There has been some criticism of the VAT measure, but a few hundred pounds off the price of car is significant even if the benefit does not apply to export models. As my noble friend Lady Wall knows, we have dedicated &#163;65 million to fund training in the automotive and related sectors, part of the &#163;1 billion allocated to Train to Gain that  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1529"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assists companies identifying appropriate training. I think only 45 of a possible 300 automotive companies have engaged with SEMTA, the sector skills council. If there is more we can do to help in training, design or simple communication&#151;with SEMTA or with SSCs in conjunction&#151;we are willing to do it. We are in constant communication with DIUS to see if there is more that can be done to make these schemes work effectively.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09011938000069"></a>My noble friend Lord Harrison and others asked for a report on the meeting last Friday convened by European Commissioner Verheugen. My noble friend Lord Mandelson attended the meeting&#151;arranged at his behest&#151;where Governments agreed to co-ordinate support for the industry and seek early engagement with the new US Administration to understand the transfer of their measures to companies working and operating in the European markets. In addition, the Czech presidency agreed to put the issue on the agenda of the spring Competitiveness Council and we made a specific request to accelerate the accessibility and delivery of the already allocated EIB funding, ensuring that all manufacturers were eligible for the funds available. My noble friend also asked about the Government&#146;s view of membership of the single currency. The Government&#146;s position on that has not changed.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09011938000070"></a>What further support is there? People say Government should do more. Many of you have said this evening that this is not enough. We understand this argument. Members of this House and others feel strongly about this issue. There has been much discussion about further support. My noble friend Lord Mandelson has made clear that if there is appropriate assistance that we can offer, we will consider it. We have also been urged to take action because other countries have already done so&#151;the argument made here this evening is that companies in the United Kingdom will be at a competitive disadvantage if other companies act first and we are slow to follow. This is something for us to consider and monitor&#151;we are doing both. We also need to be sure that any action we take will work in the United Kingdom and for the United Kingdom, given the structure of the UK&#146;s industry in this sector. The circumstances and needs of car manufacturers in other countries are different. It is right that each country responds, albeit in concert, according to what is best for them.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09011938000071"></a>My noble friend Lord Mandelson is meeting representatives from the industry for a second automotive summit at the end of the month&#151;my noble friend Lady Wall referred to that. I would not go as far as another noble friend in describing being a junior Minister as &#147;dehumanising&#148;&#151;though anyone who transfers from business to a ministerial portfolio recognises some of his analysis. I have learnt during my short time at BERR that it is inadvisable to pre-empt my Secretary of State and suggest what the outcomes from a future meeting he is chairing might be. Equally, on how we would choose to forecast the length of the challenges facing this sector, I have also learnt that forecasting the length of time current conditions will last is best done by forecasters not Ministers&#151;let alone junior ones. You will not be surprised that  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1530"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>BERR and Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury are as one in recognising the significance of the issues being faced by the automotive sector.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09011938000072"></a>We understand the urgency, but we will not and, I am afraid, cannot be rushed into taking action that might not be effective. Any assistance needs to be for the future and not for the past. This Government fully recognise the pain the sector is feeling&#151;we are not debating this reality, but rather how to handle it and not make false assumptions of what the industry may look like in the future. We also need to have an eye on what would best help to keep jobs and investment in the United Kingdom, and ensure that we are best placed to win new investment in the future.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09011938000073"></a>Noble Lords have asked about support for particular companies, but they would not expect me to comment on commercially sensitive discussions. However, to the specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, with respect to Nissan, it is fair to say that the 1,200 job losses announced recently are regrettable. We understand that this decision was reached specifically in response to the market. The view of the plant is that it is one of the most efficient in Europe. The regional development agency, One North East, which I am sure the noble Lord knows well, will lead a taskforce to help Nissan and its suppliers deal with the consequences of the decision, and we will help any employee through the suite of schemes available to find alternative opportunities as quickly as possible. As a Government, we remain committed to the Sunderland plant. We contributed &#163;6.2 million to it which did help to secure the model that the noble Lord referred to. We will continue to work with Nissan to secure new investment and, indeed, my noble friend Lord Mandelson plans to visit the plant as soon as possible to discuss plans to bring the manufacture of Nissan&#146;s new family of electric vehicles to the site, in line with our commitment to the development of low carbon vehicles as an integral part of the UK automotive industry for the future.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09011938000074"></a>On the specific point also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, on scrapping to stimulate demand&#151;which I assume is what lies behind the question&#151;we are aware of it and are considering it carefully. Some countries in Europe have looked at this, but as a number of speakers have already indicated, 86 per cent of the cars purchased in the United Kingdom are imports. In truth, scrappage is likely to be of greater benefit to other countries, although we recognise that it would be of some help to the retail sector.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09011938000075"></a>The Government are looking at the industry as a whole and not just at the automotive sector. Suffice it to say that any government intervention to help the biggest companies would be exceptional and should not get in the way of necessary restructuring. We have a responsibility to the taxpayer and a responsibility, when considering intervention in any market, that we do not harm the fittest when seeking to help the most challenged. Critically, when one is considering sectoral intervention, one needs to be very clear that one is not propping up business models, product lines, capacity and pricing structures from another time.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09011938000076"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Harrison and all the other speakers for their contributions to this critical set of issues, and confirm that we will return in writing to any questions that were not answered.</p>

The clause deals with resolution fund orders, and we have no fundamental problem with the concept. However, subsection (4) states that the resolution fund,</p>
<ul><a name="09011938000137"></a>&#147;may confer a discretionary function on&#151;</ul>(a) a Minister of the Crown,(b) the Treasury,(c) the Bank of England, or (d) any other specified person&#148;.
<p><a name="09011938000124"></a>My amendment would delete this to find out what it is really about.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09011938000078"></a>I cannot see that any other comparable provision has been made in the case of compensation orders or third-party compensation orders, and as usual the Explanatory Notes offer little or nothing about this subsection. When this was debated in another place, the Minister did reasonably well in explaining why the first three paragraphs were dealt with, although he did not explain why similar provisions were not necessary for the other kinds of order. I hope that today the Minister will be able to explain that. However, the Minister in another place ran out of steam when he came to explain why the phrase &#147;any other specified person&#148; was necessary. He started off by saying that it was to cover independent valuers, even though they are already mentioned specifically in the clause. He went on to talk about having an independent auditor of resolution costs, or a monitor of fees, although it is quite unclear why it is necessary to &#147;confer a discretionary function&#148; in order to purchase common or garden services.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09011938000079"></a>The Minister then took refuge in an argument along these lines: &#147;We don&#146;t really know what we might need to do, so we are legislating to give ourselves enough cover to do whatever we come across&#148;. That is the old excuse to cover up draft legislation that has not really been thought out in advance. I invite the Minister to place on the record a somewhat more convincing justification for subsection (4), particularly why it is contained in resolution fund orders but not compensation or third-party compensation orders. I beg to move.</p>

Let me summarise briefly the purpose of the bank resolution fund. It is to provide either the failing bank or its shareholders, depending on the nature of the transfer power exercised, with a contingent economic interest in the net proceeds of the resolution. The fund is thus a proxy for compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09011938000081"></a>A resolution fund order can provide for which parties will be entitled to a share of the proceeds, and how such proceeds will be calculated. Importantly, the proceeds may be calculated net of any resolution costs. Those costs could, for example, include any financial assistance including loans or guarantees provided from, or backed by, public funds or any other administrative expense incurred by the authorities during the course of the resolution. The provision is necessary to ensure the taxpayer receives a suitable return for public funds that have been invested, or put at risk in the bank, during that resolution.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09011938000082"></a>I understand that the purpose of Amendment 99 is to remove the ability of the Treasury to confer, in a bank resolution fund order, a discretionary function on a Minister, the Treasury, the Bank of England or any other specified person. In summary, I do not agree with the amendment, as it is essential that the Government should have the ability to confer functions on persons to ensure that the appropriate level of compensation is paid to appropriate persons. The bank resolution fund order may specify a role for a number of persons: an independent valuer, an independent auditor of the resolution costs, or a monitor of the fees could, for example, be appointed to perform certain roles. Therefore, instead of listing all persons that may have discretionary functions conferred on them, subsection (4)(d) allows the Treasury to,</p>
<ul><a name="09011938000138"></a>&#147;confer a discretionary function on ... any other specified person&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011938000125"></a>in the bank resolution fund order.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09011938000083"></a>I recognise that this discretion does not appear in the clauses on the compensation schemes or third-party compensation schemes order&#151;the noble Baroness is quite correct in that observation. This is because the bank resolution fund is a new device, specific to this Bill. It is possible, therefore, that we find that various individuals will be required to perform ad hoc functions. Clearly, those cannot all be specified in advance in the Bill. I hope my explanation of the importance of this power reassures the Committee and I therefore beg that this amendment be withdrawn.</p>

My question is: why is this permissive?</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09011938000086"></a>Is it not the case that, as property is being taken from the shareholders of the bank or the bank itself, the Bank or Treasury must seek to maximise the proceeds, subject to achieving the special resolution objectives? If it could ever be argued that proceeds maximisation was not a proper and essential objective, that makes the draconian powers in the Bill start to verge on the unacceptable. It may also cause conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09011938000087"></a>Apart from this basic challenge to the underlying premise in the two subsections that proceeds maximisation might not be appropriate, will the Minister explain how an order can both specify the maximisation of proceeds and, as in paragraphs (b) of the subsections, specify its extent? Surely maximisation is a little like pregnancy&#151;one cannot be a little bit pregnant and one cannot maximise a little bit either. I hope the Minister can shed some light on this. I beg to move.</p>

We find ourselves in a situation in which it is difficult to realise exactly what is going on because much of it is so radical that we have no previous experience of it. Effectively, we have had a situation where a huge percentage of the UK economy is dependent on financial services for its whole prosperity to a large extent. We are now moving into a situation where the returns from that will clearly be substantially less than they were before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09011938000090"></a>Much of the banking sector will be run, effectively, by the Government. That raises the question&#151;I shall be interested in the Minister&#146;s response&#151;that what we are really trying to do is to tie them down or even encourage them to maximise the proceeds available for distribution. There was a similar experience in the way in which conditions were imposed on some of the banks which have already been affected. It may be that one really wants to maximise the long-term prospects of the bank concerned, which is not the same as maximising the proceeds for distribution in accordance with the order. Is the Minister proposing at some stage to set out what the serious objectives should be of banks which suddenly find themselves either temporarily or in part under government control?</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09011938000092"></a>Dealing first with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I repeated the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s Statement in the other place earlier in which there was a clear statement that the Government&#146;s view is that banks are best in the private sector and best run on a commercial basis. We have no interest as a matter of policy in taking control of a bank for even the shortest period. However, the Bill contemplates circumstances in which that may, through force of what has happened, become necessary.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09011938000093"></a>The noble Lord made an interesting observation about the size of the financial services sector and whether there is a point at which it can be too large for an economy. Some of the work that I am doing in a group chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir Win Bischoff on the financial services market and its future addresses this, among a number of other issues. I believe that those are matters to which this House and the other place may wish to return. We were blessed in the past, because of the prudent and cautious management of our great financial institutions, our banks and insurance companies, to be a major provider of banking and other financial services to the world. That has been a source of strength. At the moment, it is not obviously clear that that remains the case.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09011938000094"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that there is no inconsistency between maximising the value of the business and maximising the proceeds. To put a bank in a safe, secure and commercially strong position is good not only for the customers, but for the owners of the bank before it was put into a resolution regime. I hope that there is no inconsistency here, but the noble Lord is right to draw attention to the inevitable challenges that will arise.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09011938000095"></a>The purpose of Amendments 100 and 102 would appear to be to remove the power of the Treasury to specify, in a bank resolution fund order, that the Bank of England or the Treasury must ensure that a bridge bank, or a bank in temporary public ownership, must be managed in a manner that maximises the proceeds available for distribution. The bank resolution fund provides those with a residual interest in a resolved bank&#151;either the residual bank in the case of a property transfer, or former shareholders in the case of a share transfer&#151;with a contingent economic interest in the proceeds of resolution. It is surely right that, in some circumstances, a management duty should be placed on either the Bank of England or the Treasury to maximise any proceeds in such a fund. The noble Baroness is right to say that, in the absence of this requirement, the draconian consequences of other measure in the Bill would have to be revisited. It is designed to ensure that the interests of the previous owners of the business or assets are not treated in a capricious or dismissive manner.</p>

<a name="90119-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09011938000096"></a>I stress that any management duty is subordinate to the SRR objectives and compliance with the code of practice. I also point out that the proceeds in a bank resolution fund may be calculated net of any public funds or other forms of financial assistance, including the costs of the resolution, as I explained when addressing the previous amendment. This measure was inserted specifically to protect public funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09011938000099"></a>The Minister said that &#147;in some circumstances&#148; there would be a duty to maximise. He went on to say that the subsection was designed to ensure that previous owners are not treated capriciously or dismissively. My point was: why was this only permissive? Why would a resolution fund order not always require the maximisation of proceeds, subject of course&#151;as I accepted&#151;to the special resolution objectives, specified in paragraph (a)? Why would a resolution fund order not require the Bank of England or the Treasury to maximise proceeds? The Minister did not say why that would be the case.</p>

The proceeds of resolution will be the product of a series of management decisions by a bridge bank&#146;s board of directors and the Bank of England as a shareholder&#151;for example, how the business should be managed, when and at what price to sell parts of the bridge bank and so on&#151;or, alternatively, the Treasury if the bank is brought into temporary public ownership in the light of prevailing market conditions. We consider that a duty is necessary in some circumstances in order to provide a specific protection for all the beneficiaries&#146; interests and to help to ensure that the proceeds of resolution will bear a reasonable relation to the value of the property expropriated from the failing bank, subject to the overriding need to act in a manner consistent with the SRR objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09011938000106"></a>The noble Baroness asks why the wording is permissive, and I fully understand why she should seek an explanation. In certain circumstances, such as the initial transfer to a bridge bank, disposals by the Bank of England days after the initial transfer or where there is no need for duty and no ongoing management decisions, the word &#147;may&#148; would be appropriate. However, I agree with the noble Baroness that in the majority of circumstances one would contemplate that the use of the word &#147;may&#148; was permissive. I should like to take away her comments. I assure her that we will reflect carefully on whether a modification of language would be helpful in addressing the point she has raised.

My spellchecker does not think so and the word appears in virtually no dictionaries, although we found it in the <I>Oxford </I><I>English D</I><I>ictionary</I>, which cites only two known uses of the word. We may conclude that it just about qualifies as part of the English language.

I was about to move the next amendment, which might have confused the Minister. Amendment 104 seeks to change &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148; in Clause 60(1), which deals with third party compensation arrangements in cases of partial transfers. This clause allows the Treasury to make an order which will give effect to the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard promised by the November consultation document. The industry has welcomed this and we support it, though as I mentioned in connection with the set-off and netting issue, the lack of certainty about outcome of the processes set out in the draft order&#151;and, indeed, in the clause&#151;means that it adds nothing to the legal certainty that is required for set-off and netting arrangements.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09011938000119"></a>We cannot understand why the Treasury should have the option to issue the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; order. It promised it as a safeguard and should be required to deliver it. Anything else would create uncertainty, which we have already debated in the context of partial transfers. I hope that the Minister can agree to this because it is a straightforward case of making an order and is not subject to the more complex provisions that we came across in the context of whether we should have &#147;may&#148; or &#147;shall&#148; in Clause 48. Clause 60 is very much more straightforward and I hope that the Government agree that this is a no-brainer. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09011938000133"></a>&#147;In making regulations the Treasury shall ensure that&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011938000128"></a>We have discussed &#147;have regard to&#148;, but this set of words also includes &#147;desirability&#148; so we have two uncertainties. The language is another example of &#147;now you see it, now you don&#146;t&#148;; that is to say, there is an intent but how far will the intent be translated into what happens? This is an area of great sensitivity and there is a need to achieve equity. I suggest that certainty is needed.</p>

The Government&#146;s current plan is to make regulations under Clause 60 to provide for the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard. I hope that the consultation document on safeguards, which included a draft of the regulations for the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard, makes this clear.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09011938000122"></a>The Government&#146;s continuing work with the expert liaison group should provide further evidence of the sincerity of the Government&#146;s intention to provide standing secondary legislation under this enabling power. Our intention is to ensure that these safeguards are in place at the same time that the powers to make partial transfers come into force.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09011944000001"></a>However, it does not necessarily follow that the Treasury should be required always to maintain secondary legislation under Clause 60 or any of the other powers that enable legislation to be made in relation to partial transfers. The Government should have the flexibility to develop and update the content of partial transfer safeguards should they, or stakeholders, believe that there are better ways to protect certain interests.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09011944000002"></a>For example, if the Government and the market agreed that compensation to pre-transfer creditors under Clause 60 was redundant because a better way to protect this category of person could be developed, the Government should be allowed to revoke the regulations that had been made under Clause 60; but the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness would not allow this. However, I emphasise the Government&#146;s commitment to making this secondary legislation and providing appropriate protection to creditors following a partial transfer. I hope that the noble Baroness respects the Government&#146;s commitment and sincerity in these terms and feels able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09011944000003"></a>On Amendment 104A, proposed by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, I will set out in a bit more detail how the safeguard will work. In some circumstances, in a partial transfer, the payment received by creditors of the residual bank after the winding up of the residual bank may be less than they would have received had the whole of the bank gone into an insolvency procedure.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09011944000004"></a>In these situations, this clause provides a compensation mechanism. This compensation would be calculated by an independent valuer and would involve an estimation of what realisations would have been made had the whole of the bank been wound up. I believe that the purpose of the noble Viscount&#146;s amendment is to  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1540"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 1540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require that the Treasury must ensure that pre-transfer creditors do not receive less favourable treatment than they would have received had the bank been wound up immediately before transfer.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09011944000005"></a>As drafted, the clause refers to having,</p>
<ul><a name="09011944000058"></a>&#147;regard to the desirability of ensuring&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011944000046"></a>that this is the case. The clause has been drafted with care and with purpose in this respect. The regulations made under this clause will put in place a procedure that includes a calculation of a hypothetical insolvency of the failing bank.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09011944000006"></a>Given that this calculation necessarily requires an assessment of a situation which has not in fact occurred, it would not be appropriate for the Government to commit in statute that this procedure will &#147;ensure&#148;&#151;which is what is envisaged in the amendment&#151;that creditors are no worse off than if the bank had been wound up. It is not possible to know definitively what this would mean. Therefore, the language has been drafted in less concrete terms than those suggested by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and appropriately so. We are dealing with areas of some uncertainty.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09011944000007"></a>I assure the noble Viscount that the Government are committed to providing adequate compensation to creditors to ensure that this is an effective safeguard that provides confidence to creditors dealing with banks. I believe that the Government&#146;s provision under this clause and the draft regulations that we are consulting on provide this confidence. I hope that the noble Viscount will consider that those are sufficient reassurances and will not press his amendment.</p>

They have said that they might find some other way, but they would then need some statutory cover that would give them the opportunity to remove Clause 60. Putting that on one side, even if we do get the secondary legislation, the issues raised by my noble friend suggest that the third-party compensation arrangements may well have been oversold, because the Government are saying that creditors may well not be put in a no-worse-off position.

Clause 61 deals with the sources of compensation for the various compensation orders, and lists in subsection (2) the Treasury, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and then &#147;any other specified person&#148;. It is this latter category that I am seeking to probe with my amendment. Will the Minister say who these other persons might be? The clause is drawn very widely. Will he say whether there are any limits on the categories of person who may be required to cough up for a compensation order?</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09011944000011"></a>In addition, Clause 5, which requires a code of practice, does not extend to compensation orders, and in view of the breadth of Clause 61(2), it seems odd that the code of practice will not cover this issue. I invite the Minister to reflect upon whether the code should in fact be the place where this is spelt out in more detail, so that people understand how this is expected to work in practice. That is what I understood the code of practice to be aimed at. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that she has received a proper reply. Clause 61 sets out the sources of any compensation and subsection (2)(c) refers to &#147;any other specified person&#148;. The noble Baroness has indicated that that gives rise to suspicion. I hope that we have sufficiently identified the Government&#146;s actions in these terms to be beyond suspicion. Nevertheless, I recognise the noble Baroness&#146;s obvious right to probe us on this.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09011944000013"></a>Let me provide an example of who are meant by &#147;any other specified person&#148;. I have not got a little list, a big list or even a microscopic list. I have a category, and if I can I shall provide more, or an illustration of the nature of the situation which has obliged us to set out the Bill in those terms. Where a price agreed between a private sector purchaser and the Bank of England was felt to reflect the market valuation of the failing bank at the time of the transfer, the Treasury could specify in the compensation scheme order that the price agreed was deemed to be the compensation to be paid.</p>

<a name="90119-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09011944000014"></a>The provision would facilitate this by making it clear that the compensation payment&#151;in this case, the price paid by the purchaser&#151;may originate from sources other than the norm&#151;either the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Treasury. All that we seek to do in this respect is identify that the norm is envisaged as certainly being those two, but it is possible that an agreement could be struck by the Bank of England which does not involve those. We are seeking to make provision for that eventuality in circumstances where, I hasten to add, yet again we are not in a position to envisage every possible significant development with regard to these negotiations and developments. However, we have to construct the legislation in such a way that it does not inhibit or prohibit action which might be very much in the interests of the parties concerned because it is drafted too rigidly. That is why the subsection is set out in those terms.</p>

This is not incidental; it is a central consequence of the measures that would follow the use of any of the three special provisions outlined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09011944000019"></a>I am strongly in favour of the majority of the provisions in the Bill and indeed of the announcements that my noble friends Lord Mandelson and the Minister have made in relation to loans to business. However, whichever way we look at it, it is inevitable that these prospective interventions will cause major changes in the structure of one of our most important industries. Essentially, it is an industry on which the rest of the economy is dependent. It is also a service or industry on which ordinary people and small businesses depend very heavily. If we use the part-nationalisation or temporary nationalisation provisions, we create new state-owned companies. If we use the provisions for transfer into merged companies, the state is intervening to create a large company. If we use the bridge proceedings&#151;at least, for a time&#151;again, the Bank of England is using its leverage to create a substantially large banking company.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09011944000020"></a>All these changes occur in an industry in which, so far as concerns most people who seek deposit facilities, mortgages, loans and other credit facilities, the range of options is already relatively small. It is already an oligopolistic industry, and that is why many of the regulations administered by the Bank of England and the FSA exist.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09011944000021"></a>I declare my interest as chair of Consumer Focus. Looking after the interests of those who rely every day on retail banking, mortgages and credit from the banking system for their livelihoods and their very quality of life must be an essential part of the Bill. Objective 3 refers to the interests of depositors. However, the issue goes wider than that because we all depend on the banking system to work efficiently.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09011944000022"></a>The service provided by the banking system benefits from competition, but the interventions under each of these three headings will almost inevitably restrict competition, at least temporarily. When we came to my noble friend Lord Mandelson&#146;s first debate in this House, on the issue of Lloyds/HBOS, I asked him whether there was an opportunity to revisit what effectively was the exemption under that order for the merger. We were creating a retail banker which has 30 per cent of the market and a mortgage provider which has 30 per cent of the market. In any other circumstances, there would have been a reference to the competition authorities to see whether this was operating in the interests of the consumer.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09011944000023"></a>This amendment says that, where any of the interventions creates the largest company in the particular sub-market which I suggest definitions for and has more than 25 per cent of the market, there is an a priori reason for referring that to the competition authorities within 18 months&#151;one may argue about the timescale&#151;if that structure still exists. The consumers,

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09011944000024"></a>I also suggest that, because we are creating either a state bank or a merger sponsored by the state, some institutional provisions should be provided. The suggestion here is that if such a dominant bank were created in any of the markets I identify then that bank&#151;which in many cases will be a state or part-state bank&#151;should create within its structure a small business panel and a consumer panel. That may not be enough to create an institutional form but it recognises that a banking system and those who control, manage and direct banks are in a relationship not only with the whole economy but with millions of individuals. Their interests need to be reflected within that structure.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09011944000025"></a>In earlier debates the Government by and large rejected the view that, although banking in some sense is special, the directors appointed by the state&#151;I do not want to reopen this argument&#151;or the Bank of England are no different from any other directors. We are not using the public interest at the director level to look after the wider interests of the consumer and of the taxpayer; I am suggesting we need some other measure so to do. The suggestion here is that we should establish two panels in consultation with those who represent small business and consumers. Those are the two measures: an automatic reference, or one that is more automatic after a certain time, to the competition authorities; and the creation of some structure which represents the key dependence of the banking system on small business and individual consumers.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09011944000026"></a>I do not expect the Government to accept this tonight&#151;maybe they will later on; I would be delighted if they did&#151;but at least the issues which underline this amendment need to be addressed by the Government in the interests of wider society and the wider economy. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09011944000029"></a>Would the Government consider suggesting to the Lloyds Banking Group and RBS that they now establish such panels, because the Lloyds Banking Group has a very large share of the market and RBS is a largely nationalised bank? For both banks there are real questions, among their consumers of ordinary retail deposits and their small business consumers, about the way they are behaving or have behaved. This would be a good use of government influence on those two banks, which are already de facto partly nationalised.</p>

I think that we all felt a touch uncomfortable at the market position created by the Lloyds/HBOS merger and the way in which that was dealt with. However, after such a position has been created, I have a problem with instigating what can be a lengthy and costly process both for the Office of Fair Trading and for the bank concerned if there is no evidence of abuse of dominant market position. If there is no abuse, I rather hesitate to impose an investigation on everybody and I am uncomfortable with trying to impose panels on to organisations that we hope will be operating on commercial lines as far as possible. Panels may be fine for organisations such as the FSA and other public bodies, but I think that they are less obviously beneficial for companies that are operating in markets and to commercial remits.</p>

To the extent that we will ever have to use the special resolution powers that the Bill creates, I sincerely hope that it will be in the case of the smallest deposit-taking institutions rather than the major banks. It would be wrong to assume that, because of the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, this legislation is framed solely to meet the needs of very large banks. That is where the competition issue arises, but it would be wrong to assume that every use of the special resolution powers would raise the type of competition issue to which my noble friend referred in his comments in support of this amendment. That leads me to find myself in a rather similar position to that of the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, which is to say that, where special resolution is under contemplation for a very large institution, this issue of competition is just one of many factors that would have a bearing.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09011944000032"></a>The amendment is designed to make provision for a situation where the exercise of one of the stabilisation options results in a company with a dominant market share. In such circumstances, as defined in the amendment, two provisions would come into force. The first provision is that, if the company is still a dominant market player, as defined in the proposed new clause, after 18 months, the case must be referred to the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09011944000033"></a>It is important to note that the OFT and the Competition Commission already have functions that can address competition issues. For example, they have an active role under Part 4 of the Enterprise Act 2002 in investigating markets that do not appear to be meeting the needs of consumers. This can have a variety of outcomes, including the OFT making recommendations to the Government or referring the market to the Competition Commission for a more detailed investigation. Therefore, we can be satisfied that the competition authorities will continue to keep the relevant markets under review in order to protect the interests of UK consumers and the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09011944000034"></a>An example of another safeguard can be provided. Part 6 of the Enterprise Act provides cartel offences, such as those relating to price fixing. Further to this, a

For this reason, while respecting my noble friend&#146;s intention, I do not believe that it is necessary for the Bill to include provisions on referrals to the OFT.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="09011944000035"></a>Furthermore, I am not convinced that this Bill is the appropriate place to provide legislation on such matters. It is for the Competition Act, the Enterprise Act and related legislation to cover, as they already do, the remit and powers of the OFT and the Competition Commission. On that basis, I do not, with all respect to my noble friend, agree with the first part of the amendment.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09011944000036"></a>I turn to the second part of the amendment, which would require certain panels to be set up to advise the dominant company following the exercise of a stabilisation power on matters important to consumers and small business. First, I agree with the broad thrust behind that part of the amendment. It is of course right that the policies of private sector companies should be informed by the needs of their consumers, including small businesses and individuals. However, I do not believe&#151;here I find myself on common ground with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes&#151;that it is the place of legislation to enforce on companies a structure such as the panels proposed in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09011944000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that we should draw the comments of my noble friend Lord Whitty and the thrust of the amendment to the attention of the chairmen of Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland. That I will definitely do, and I will copy my letter to my noble friend and to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and ensure that they also have copies of their reply. I absolutely find myself at one with the central thrust of the argument that successful organisations are aware of and responsive to the needs of their customers. One could argue that some of the failings that our banks have experienced have been because they became too distant and remote from their customers and too engaged in financial alchemy, as opposed to meeting consumer needs.</p>

<a name="90119-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="09011944000038"></a>I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he will take considerable comfort from the views expressed on all sides of the Committee about the importance of the consumer. I also pay great tribute to his great commitment to consumers through his energetic work as chair of Consumer Focus.</p>

In particular, I thank my noble friend for his commitment on Lloyds/HBOS and RBS. That is very welcome and I look forward to their response. Were the Government to commit themselves to using informal measures to ensure that dominant companies created as a result of one form or other of government intervention take account of the views of individual consumers and small businesses, we would not need to legislate. I remain slightly sceptical that they will in all circumstances so do, but I look forward to the response to my noble friend&#146;s letter to the chairmen of the two banks concerned. Therefore, I will not press that aspect tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="09011944000040"></a>On competition, this does not affect where we are rescuing small depositors; it exists only when, fairly dramatically, we are directly or indirectly creating a dominant company. In those circumstances, given the importance of the banking sector, and the fact that the state is forcing that restructuring, there are special reasons for asking the OFT to have a look at it. Eighteen months may be too soon in an emergency; perhaps we need to give it a little more time. Nevertheless, I say to the Government that it is dangerous to have lifted the normal provisions of competition assessment and therefore to allow something through that would at least have had a cursory OFT inspection. The OFT could look at it in a preliminary way to decide whether it refers it to the Government or to the Competition Commission or takes some further steps.</p>

That is where government intervention in this field disadvantages the consumer. The examples that he cited of RBS and Lloyds/HBOS are good ones, where the Government setting a 12 per cent rate on preference shares has meant that consumers have to pay more for their loans or, indeed, their loans may not be available because the banks clearly want to pay back the preference shares. That is an example where government intervention is acting against consumers&#146; immediate interest. Has the noble Lord thought about that?</p>

But there is the bigger picture, as the Minister has said. It was essential to rescue the banks and to intervene in order to restore a degree of confidence in the banking system. That, frankly, is the big picture for consumers at this point. The way the Government have done that can be argued about in terms of the effect on some consumers. This is why I started by saying I support the main thrust of this Bill. There are

This is, after all, the structure of the industry that they have created.</p>

The noble Lord knows that there is a very significant difference between the rate of interest on a deposit and the cost of risk capital. In the circumstances prevailing in the middle of October, we were advised by our own financial advisors at the Treasury that 12 per cent was an appropriate rate for the instrument that was being offered to and accepted by the banks. Clearly, that was the view of their directors and their financial advisors as well. One major bank chose not to use that route to securing more capital. I salute them for that because our interest was in ensuring that the banks were appropriately capitalised, rather than where they drew the capital from. That bank certainly had to pay more than 12 per cent when you take into account the dilution and the warrants and new instruments they created which gave them short capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="09011944000044"></a>We could debate this issue for some time. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, is no doubt aware that we announced this morning that the Royal Bank of Scotland is converting its preference shares into ordinary shares.

The first group of amendments removes the duty on local councils to promote understanding of their functions and democratic arrangements and those of connected bodies. Instead it replaces that duty with a responsibility to note the desirability of doing so. That may seem like a trivial drafting point, but I believe that it sums up what is wrong with the Bill and how the Government&#146;s approach differs from ours.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000004"></a>Chapter 1 is, at first glance, a fairly anodyne requirement to promote understanding and awareness of a local authority&#146;s function. I expect that the Minister will tell the Committee that those duties are required to enshrine good practice in statute, but I argue that it is emblematic of the way in which the Government seem to be operating. In the Bill we have new duties imposed by central government but they have no real practical meaning; there is nothing substantive in the provisions. I am sure that most, if not all, local authorities promote democracy in some way or another. It is in their interests to do so. Quite simply, there is no need for central government to get involved and to direct how local authorities communicate with their populaces. It suggests to me that the Government wish to be seen to be doing something&#151;anything&#151;but cannot really come up with anything fresh or new, so are resorting to tinkering and meddling.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000005"></a>The Minister may well have been taken aback by the sheer number of amendments which have been tabled to this part of the Bill, which perhaps indicates a feeling in the Committee that much of the Bill is unnecessary and unwarranted. I have tabled Amendments 1, 22, 59 and 60, to Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, as a means to get discussion going on this topic. The Minister will be glad to hear that I have not sought to strike out the clauses altogether. The sentiment that local authorities should promote understanding and awareness of their own arrangements and those of bodies which have an impact on the everyday lives of the people is not a difficult one to agree with. We on   


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these Benches agree that local people should be able to access information readily about the services which they use and the authorities which provide them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, summed up the position neatly at Second Reading when she said that failing to support the Bill should not be seen as a refusal to support democracy simply,</p>
<ul><a name="09011936000104"></a>&#147;because democracy is part of the Title&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/12/08; col. 862.]</ul>
<p><a name="09011936000097"></a>There is no reason for it to be a duty. That is simply government posturing, saying, &#147;Look, we&#146;re improving local services because it says so in this piece of legislation&#148;. Democratic engagement among local people will be boosted only when they feel that local democracy has a relevance to their lives. That means giving them a chance to exercise influence over, for example, planning law, waste management, the care they receive from local health boards or the quality of their children&#146;s education. Only when that point is reached, when decisions are not taken by unaccountable quangos and people feel that their local representatives can make a real difference to their lives, can the Government say that they have successfully promoted local democratic arrangements. Until the Government start to act on their rhetoric, the duties in the Bill remain little more than that. The only practical effect is likely to be a new set of leaflets, dutifully produced to fulfil the obligations in the clauses and left standing in the foyers of town halls across the country. Unless the Government are willing to trust local authorities to exercise control over their functions and those of connected authorities, the duties in Clauses 1 to 4 are pointless&#151;and pointless duties should not be enshrined in legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000007"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09011936000116"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I start with two declarations: first, to pass on the apologies of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who unfortunately is too ill to be here today&#151;which means that she must be very ill because she wants very much to take part in the Bill. Secondly, I declare once again my interest as having served continuously as a councillor in the London Borough of Sutton for nearly 35 years. We made clear our position on the Bill during the Second Reading debate&#151;I am grateful to the noble Baroness for quoting a very good summary of it given then by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. It is not that we are against the promotion of democracy; exactly the opposite is true. It is rather, as I said at Second Reading, that we see it as being properly the role of local authorities. It is for them to decide best how to do it in terms of their local circumstances, the nature of the local area and so on. It really is not the business of central government to prescribe, even to the extent and detail that is being done here, how local authorities should do it. As we go on through Committee, and particularly as we delve into the many amendments to be moved by my noble friend Lord Greaves, who has much experience of these matters, we will see just how difficult it becomes when you get into the detail of promoting local democracy, petition schemes and so on.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000008"></a>I turn to the four amendments in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. The first three, Amendments 2, 23 and 61, would insert the words &#147;to use reasonable endeavours&#148;. They retain the promotion  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of democracy as a duty, but not as an absolute duty. That is qualified by Amendment 21, which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09011936000105"></a>&#147;an assessment of the extent to which it is reasonable to incur expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011936000098"></a>That is an extremely important consideration these days for any local authority. If they are to meet these duties, they must have regard to the amount of expenditure that it is reasonable to incur in doing so. It is a necessary qualification that should appear in the Bill. The Explanatory Notes give some indication of government estimates of expenditure. I am unclear as to how that estimate is to be translated into increased grant to local authorities to meet costs, especially for those London boroughs which are floor authorities, as most of them are, and receive no increase in grant for any and all purposes.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000009"></a>The purpose of our series of amendments is to make the promotion of democracy not an absolute but a qualified duty&#151;&#147;to use reasonable endeavours&#148;. It is entirely right that local authorities should promote democracy&#151;rather less right that government should insist on it&#151;but, as always, it must be balanced by the need to assess the expenditure necessary to achieve the purpose desired.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000010"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09011936000117"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I shall speak to the Conservative amendments in this group. I am likely to support them. Since this is the first time I have spoken in this Committee, I declare my interest as an elected member of Pendle Borough Council and, as a consequence of that, of various other bodies. I am not terribly excited by the wording of the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi,</p>
<ul><a name="09011936000106"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of promoting&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011936000099"></a>which sounds as though it was written by civil servants rather than politicians. However, I understand what she is getting at. Throughout Part 1, I am going to be very critical, particularly of this chapter about promoting democratic involvement in various things and of the petitions section.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000011"></a>Since these things get written down, I ought to make it clear that I am not against public involvement in local government. I have been promoting it for the past 40 years, particularly when members of the Minister&#146;s party were denouncing it as being entirely wrong in principle and in practice, and liable to undermine the whole fabric of local government, indeed, the whole fabric of society. It is excellent that the Government are now converted to the cause, but it is bad that they think that the way to promote local involvement is by detailed, top-down edicts of the kind that appear in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000012"></a>If anybody doubts what I am saying, I shall call my noble friend Lord Tope in evidence. A very long time ago, just after he had been elected as the Member of Parliament for Sutton and Cheam at a famous by-election in 1972, a pamphlet was issued, purportedly written by him, called <I>Liberals and the Community.</I> It was written by three of us who were promoting the cause at that stage and because my noble friend had become an MP, we thought it was sensible to put his name on the cover. Many other Members of the Committee can testify that I have been campaigning on these matters

I was hoping that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, would be here. He said he would be. Perhaps I shall call him in evidence when he appears.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000013"></a>What is Chapter 1 about? The Government want to give local authorities a duty to promote. My noble friend suggests they should &#147;use reasonable endeavours&#148; and the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, suggests they should,</p>
<ul><a name="09011936000107"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of promoting&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011936000100"></a>There are five pages of detailed legislation on the promotion of democracy. They are about telling people how the system of local government in their area works in the hope that that will get them more involved. They are about producing a map of the local structures. I have no objection to that; it is a sensible idea. In most places nowadays, everything is so complex that very few people have the slightest idea about who is responsible for what. In two-tier areas, it is even worse. There is a plethora of local quangos, partnerships, forums, local authority companies and all kinds of bodies, all of which have something to do and form part of the system of local government. If you asked me to write down the system in my own area, I do not think that I could; I certainly could not get an A grade in an examination on it, because it is so complex. Some parts of it I deliberately keep well away from, because there is a limit to what you can do.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000014"></a>I have no objection to the Government putting a duty on a local authority to write it all down, but that does not require five pages of detailed legislation or the extraordinary procedures set down here for how a district will relate to a county and how everybody else will relate to each other. The Government must understand that simply writing it down and saying what the structure is does not create local democratic involvement, which is fundamentally a &#147;small p&#148; political process. It is about people campaigning and people caring for their area and getting involved. It is about active involvement.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000015"></a>There was an item yesterday on the &#147;Politics Show&#148; in the northwest, which most Members of the Committee will not have seen because it was on the northwest bit that nobody sees. The item was about what is going on in the Wirral. They interviewed people who are agitating, running huge campaigns and really getting involved in a big way, because it appears&#151;according to the television programme&#151;that Wirral council is setting about taking a hatchet to a lot of local community facilities. It is closing community centres, libraries and swimming pools; that is what the programme said, anyhow. I have no detailed knowledge of that. So lots of articulate local residents, who are not particularly middle class, are all getting involved, all expressing their anger and all organising campaigns&#151;all very worked up, agitated and involved.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000016"></a>The way to really get people involved is to close down things that they value. Then you get public involvement on a big scale. Of course, that is not what the Government think and want&#151;but what should we do about this? What I would really like to do, as I think would the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and my noble friend, is to kick out this part of the Bill and at the very least put it into the review and consultation  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Government are undertaking on community empowerment and citizen involvement, or whatever the latest buzz phrases are. I think that it is citizen empowerment, but I do not know. A lot of this was going to be in a community empowerment Bill, which is no longer coming to us. That is why we have the dregs of it in front of us now. They should take them back, put them into that, look at it all as a whole and reflect on what the proper role is for central government here.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000017"></a>If central government promotes ideas and puts out useful advice rather than statutory guidance, encouraging local government to spread best practice, we will get a large amount of this happening voluntarily, and we will get it happening in a much better way than if we simply laid down national rules and regulations. One reason why it will be much better is that it will vary from area to area and from authority to authority. Varying what is happening is the real way in which to find out what is best. You do not find out what is best by laying down national blueprints that everyone has to carry out. You find out what is best by letting people do their own thing on the ground, once you have laid down the basic principle.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000018"></a>I do not think that we have any real chance of getting this kicked out. I hope that the Government are listening and will take it back, but if they will not we will have to try to improve it, accepting all the risks but at least making sure&#151;</p>

Surely they are basically different, because the Conservative proposal is to take away a duty to do anything and simply have regard to desirability, whereas the Liberal amendment maintains a duty but says that the authority should use &#147;reasonable endeavours&#148;. Surely they are fundamentally different approaches.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000020"></a>The noble Lord cannot support both the Conservative and the Liberal amendment. Which does he actually support?</p>

Both are probing ways in which it could be made less prescriptive and more flexible.</p>

It occurred to me as the debate moved on that the constructive amendment of the Liberal Democrats is quite reasonable. I am not sure that it is really useful, but it is certainly constructive to insert &#147;reasonable endeavours&#148; before &#147;duty to promote&#148;. However, the Conservative amendment is completely destructive and not positive at all. I quite agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, that it is not a drafting amendment: it is not. It is a destructive amendment because it would remove completely the duty to promote and would insert words that may as well not be there at all. It states that the local authority &#147;must have regard to the desirability of promoting&#148;, which means  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that anyone can do anything they like. You might as well suggest that the whole clause should go&#151;not just Clause 1 but all the other clauses to which amendments in this group apply.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000023"></a>Neither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats have admitted in this debate or at Second Reading that at the moment, local government and local democracy are at a pretty low ebb in terms of public regard. It is not as if there is tremendous public regard for local government and tremendous participation, other than in the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. When something is being closed down, everybody turns up at a meeting so long as it is reasonably well arranged, but in the normal course of things, the peoples&#146; vote at local elections is lamentable. I would have thought that other Governments&#151;when in power as distinct from being merely potential Governments&#151;would realise that something needed to be done in the form of legislation. There should be a duty to promote local democracy and a duty to do various other detailed things. I would not go so far as the Government in laying things down in such detail in the Bill&#151;a point of criticism which I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;but there should be a duty to promote local democracy. Increasing the ways and means of public participation in local affairs is wholly desirable. I do not see why any of the amendments in this first group should be passed.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000024"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09011936000121"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Will the noble Lord comment on an interesting situation? The amount of involvement by people in local government and in local councils in particular is greater now than it has ever been. That is true in almost every local authority, yet people&#146;s regard for local authorities is, as far as we can tell, at a pretty low ebb and possibly lower than it has ever been. How does the noble Lord square those two facts?</p>

<p><a name="09011936000025"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09011936000122"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I find it difficult to believe what the noble Lord said. I dare say that if you choose two particular dates you could argue that interest in local democracy has increased, but in general that does not seem to be so at all. I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to establish more clearly the point that he seeks to make.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000026"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09011936000123"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The number of local initiatives that councils carry out nowadays&#151;to hold meetings and set up forums and action groups&#151;is higher than it has ever been and there is no doubt that more people than ever are taking part in them. In many places, there is so much consultation going on that people are suffering from consultation fatigue.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000027"></a>Finally, I do not know what proportion of local authorities not only allow but actively encourage people to go along to committee or authority meetings and take part in agenda items that interest them, but I guess that it would be a third. It used to be zero. The amount of and facilities for involvement are rightly higher than they have ever been, partly because people like us have been campaigning for them. The more people take part, the less regard they have for what they see when they do.</p>

However, they are only examples. They cannot apply across the country as a whole. There is no legislation that requires all local authorities to do that. It is surely desirable, however, that the example of some local authorities should be followed. I come back to my basic point that participation in the vital matter of local elections is lamentably low.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000030"></a>I am afraid that I find it difficult to believe that the legislation will make a huge difference to what we are talking about. We want to see more people involved and local government held in higher esteem. Oh, that it were that simple. It is honestly naive to believe that all that is written here will make that happen. It will not. I therefore hope that when the Minister responds to our discussions this afternoon she can explain to us where is the evidence base that the Government have used to bring forward this legislation that they think will make a difference to what happens in local democracy. We are going to spend a lot of time here and, at the end, it will be difficult to see a huge difference.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000031"></a>I would also like to hear from the Minister how the Government will monitor whether this will work. I see a problem with the Government repeatedly coming forward with legislation. We have an amendment to this Bill that amends an Act that was passed only in the last Session of Parliament. Something is wrong somewhere if we have to do this all the time. Nothing makes local government life more difficult than the continuous legislation and guidance that authorities must deal with. I say that from the heart as someone who has been a councillor for a borough that represents only 26,000 people and therefore has few officers to deal with the amount of legislation coming out. I would be interested to hear if the Minister has compelling evidence that this will make a difference.</p>

The Minister is entitled to feel somewhat aggrieved that the Government and the Bill are attempting to tackle a problem that we all know exists. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, says about there being more opportunities and more initiatives to engage. He may well have evidence that, as a result, local democracy is now better or stronger, but it is not.</p>

I have a high regard and respect for both his work and that of the county council. I am sure that there will be good illustrations of when people do not need to rely on the weapons in this group of amendments, but, sadly, there will be others. Some people have a vested interest in democracy being asleep more than it being lively. Some people have sat on a council for a long time. I wonder how long the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has been on his council.</p>

The Government should be commended for saying that, in 2009, there needs to be a stimulus. People may rearranged words and put emphasis on different words, but we are all about the same. Some people want to do something, while others want to do nothing. Doing nothing might be the answer, but the Government are entitled to say that, based on the evidence, there is a need to do something.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000037"></a>My noble friend has pointed out that the test of democracy may be the number of people who vote. I would be surprised if evidence can be produced to show that, consistently, uniformly, throughout the country, there has been a steady rise in the number of people who vote, and we should forget the outcome of the voting. An aspect of the Bill that I applaud is that it may encourage people in the communities we represent to wonder what they can do to make their democracy more vibrant.</p>

I do not think a claim can be made that any one part of the country which is dominated by one political party is better off than another. During the past 40 years, the Government of the day would have been entitled to come forward with legislation to remedy the problem. There is a problem and it will not go away. The Government are entitled not just to defend their stance, but also to have the endorsement of this Committee and the House to do what they can.</p>

I believe that all sides honestly are saying that there are problems about local democracy. Members of the Committee on the opposite Benches have referred to two ways in which people can get involved. One is participation, which can mean two things. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right. The opportunity for people to get

Never in my 31 years have we been involved in more local committees and local activities to give people an opportunity to have a say on things. Unfortunately, those people who get really involved are a minority. Probably, the same people who get interested in one issue then get involved in other aspects of consultation. So there is a need to drive up those numbers and, again, we would want to share best practice.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000040"></a>My noble friend mentioned voting, which is a problem both locally and nationally. Whatever we do locally, we need to bear that in mind. In the case mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, there may be higher participation. But, inevitably, that is the nature of making decisions in local government. People have to make tough decisions.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000041"></a>As many Members of the Committee may know, recently, I was involved in running a referendum in Greater Manchester on improvements in public transport, but it became a referendum just on whether there should be a congestion charge. There was a 55 per cent turnout. In particular, young people, who do not normally take part in local elections, voted. Whereas the average turnout in Greater Manchester probably is about 30 per cent, for this it was almost twice that figure. On an issue about which people really feel involved and feel that they can influence, we can get participation in terms of voting. But I am not a great advocate of referendums, particularly after that experience.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to the complexities of local governance. We are not talking about only local government, but about getting involved in partnerships and other agencies, and about collaborating with other authorities, which is probably for the better. This Bill includes something on that. I wonder whether it makes sense to do things beyond local boundaries for the good of the people who we are elected to represent. These things are complicated, but we need to explain them in ordinary language that people can understand and not in the language of the Bill. Members of the Committee have mentioned the great danger of the Government trying to be too specific. But let us be honest and acknowledge that there is a problem which we must try to tackle.</p>

To some extent, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and I am not too depressed about the desire of people to get involved in local government, local institutions and so on. If anything, there is a growing desire to get involved, which is not least helped by the internet and the ease of two-way communication. In a sense, we could be on the verge of a step change in involvement.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000044"></a>I agree with the Government on the sheer number of bodies which operate at a local level. That is due to the enormous decentralisation of a lot of decisions, which is to be welcomed. The number of things done by national government many years ago has reduced enormously. Clauses 2, 3 and 4 list many of those  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bodies. I will not read them all because it would take too long, but they include national parks, police authorities, waste disposal bodies, primary care trusts, joint waste authorities, magistrates, various monitoring boards, court boards, youth offending boards, and so on.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000045"></a>One of the problems that people face is, oddly, with the sheer complexity of all those organisations, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said. The Government are right in seeking to find a way in which some coherence is offered to people in local communities to explain what all these bodies are and how people who want to can get involved, in a common approach. If 20 or 30 bodies are all putting material out, all in a quite different way, from completely different angles and with completely different levels of professionalism and different degrees of intent, then you get one thing. If a local council or local authority is charged with ensuring that a cohesive approach is presented to people, so they know what all the bodies are and know, in a common language, what they do and how people can get involved, that will be a step forward.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000046"></a>Like noble Lords opposite, I agree that there is no panacea in that; it does not necessarily guarantee anything. But the current lack of coherence and the disparate way in which these things are presented or not presented creates a very confusing picture. What tends to happen is that a lot of people get involved in an issue because it happens to be very important to them at that time, but they do not get involved in other things. I suspect that many people get onto local authorities in that way&#151;they used to, in my time. People would get involved in a local action group, become motivated and then get onto a local authority. I suspect that the same thing happens in many other ways.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000047"></a>The Government are on to something here. There is a problem and it would make a lot of sense to try to improve on the situation. I suspect that, if local authorities are given the duty to set matters out coherently, in a single manner, on a single website or a related website and have to present to people in a meaningful way, using a common language, how all these bodies are, how they all relate, what they do, how people could get involved and how it affects them, it would lead to a more coherent monitoring of what those bodies do. There would be a lot more comparison; people would notice that one body was getting a lot more people involved than another body, and ask why that was happening. At the moment, nobody sits down and reflects on that. If you are really concerned with magistrates&#146; courts, you are greatly interested in how they operate, but you do not really ask too much about what is happening with local primary care trusts or other bodies.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000048"></a>There is more behind the Government&#146;s objective, as long as one is not carried away by what it can achieve in itself. As I understand the Liberal Democrats concerns, they are that we should not raise people&#146;s hopes too much about what an organisational or institutional change can bring about. The Government are on to something; there is an issue here, and it is best addressed in a coherent way. I, for one, applaud the Government&#146;s efforts to do so in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000049"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09011936000131"></a>Lord Best:</b> I declare my interest as president of the Local Government Association. It may be worth reminding ourselves what the representative bodies of local authority government say about this&#151;the LGA and the LGIU, to which some of us are indebted, because it services the All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group. These bodies representing local government are fairly clear on their position; they are not opposed to, and in principle support, a new duty on local authorities of a kind envisaged by this Bill. However, they are very anxious about this becoming prescriptive and about the already good examples of local authorities doing their own thing very well being hampered by central government having clear ideas that it must be done in particular ways.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000050"></a>The response to the question, &#147;Why bother?&#148;&#151;why bother that central government has put a duty of this kind into a Bill?&#151;can be both negative and positive. The positive response is that it sends out a signal to local authorities that this is a more than respectable thing to spend your time and your ratepayers&#146; money on. It is important that local government takes seriously the issue of empowering local people and promoting democracy. It gives a licence to people to get on with it and to fend off objection from those who ask, &#147;Why are they spending our money, telling us how we should be better represented locally? What&#146;s all this publicity and campaigning on behalf of empowerment?&#148;.</p>
<h5><a name="09011936000051"></a><I>4.15 pm</I></h5>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000052"></a>The Bill places a duty on local authorities, giving them a positive backdrop in taking the matter seriously and spending money on it. It also says to them, &#147;If you are not sure of the ways in which this may happen, listen to the Improvement and Development Agency and to organisations such as the LGA which is producing good advice and trying to share good experience across councils. Listen, and take notice and an interest in this whole issue. The negative side is that you may need fall-back powers for that tiny minority who always let the side down&#148;.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000053"></a>Whatever it is one wants local government to do, the majority get on with it sometimes more speedily and in a more exciting way, but one or two laggards are left behind. By giving local authorities a duty to get on with something that a handful will never get around to merely puts power into the hands of central government when needed. The overarching message is that if there is acceptance in principle from the local authority representative bodies, so also is there a fear that central government may take a good thing too far and get immersed in some of the detail, which would be very counterproductive.</p>

I welcome a new cast in the shape of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. It is very nice to see him on the Front Bench alongside the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi. I am sorry that we do not have the pleasure of seeing the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, today, and I hope that she is better by Wednesday.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000055"></a>I thank all Members of the Committee who took part in that debate. The range of contributions was wide and it was important to expose complex issues, such as what we mean by &#147;participation&#148; and &#147;influence&#148;. I will not apologise for the fact that my speaking note is rather long, because I, too, want to expose some of those issues.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000056"></a>I am very grateful for the support of my noble friends and for their challenging questions on what was said by both opposition parties. I was grateful for the contribution of my noble friend Lord Best on where local government organisations stand. It was salutary to hear that. However, I am disappointed because I know that the accumulated weight of experience and wisdom around the Committee, particularly on the opposition Benches, does not make for great understanding of the intentions behind the Bill, which we have tried to express. There is a definite consensus around the Committee that these provisions are worth making but that it is a question of how we make them and how we balance the generally enabling framework that we want to create with the concern about some of the detail.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000057"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie was right to call the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to account for his response to the two sets of amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said that this is not a trivial drafting point, and indeed it is not. Amendments 2, 23 and 6 and Amendments 1, 22, 59 and 60 are different. The latter group in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is destructive. The noble Baroness said that she would be convinced when local people felt local government to be relevant. I would argue that that is exactly the point of this clause and this Bill. However, in order to perceive something as relevant, you have to have the information that enables you to understand how those decisions that affect your lives are made and what you can do about them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000058"></a>Ultimately, we are not only about enabling people to engage more directly and influentially with local government, but about revitalising the base of local democracy and the services on which people depend. This is not an emblematic Bill as the noble Baroness suggests. It is not insubstantial. It addresses serious issues and ways of doing things. We have the balance right. The degree of detail&#151;the how&#151;will be left to local authorities. This clause and subsequent clauses create the framework to build on the best and let local authorities decide how they can make this work effectively in their local community for local people.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000059"></a>We do not agree that there is no need for a duty on local authorities to promote democracy, that it is unnecessary and onerous or that they are already able to do so. I shall explain why on the basis of the evidence. I have been grateful for this early discussion of the complexity that has emerged in local government in response to the many different challenges over the past decade, not least in the ways of doing things and emerging issues such as climate change and how to work with the third sector in the delivery of services. We have created a much more complex and dynamic landscape. The most telling point in this debate was made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, when he said that he does not understand and cannot draw a map of his own local authority&#146;s decision-making structures.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

I said that I cannot draw a map of the system of local governance. I can draw a map of the system of the local authority of which I am a member, but I doubt whether I can do that for the county council and everything else. That was the point that the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, was making.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000061"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09011936000134"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I do not think that undermines my point because the Bill addresses the relationships and the flow of information between partner authorities. That is why it is so important.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000062"></a>I return to the question of why we need a duty and whether the form of words &#147;to have regard&#148; would be sufficient. It would not be sufficient. I return to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, about evidence. Why did the Councillors Commission think it was vital to have a duty? The noble Lord, Lord Best, said that the duty to promote democracy should be recognised as a core function of local authorities. The LGA supports the duty on the basis that it is not overly prescriptive and does not add to a council&#146;s administrative and bureaucratic burden. I shall need to be able to reinforce that in what I say and put certain things on the record.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000063"></a>Commenting on the commitment to take the duty forward in response to the Councillors Commission report, the LGA stated that the duty to promote democracy recognises and reinforces councillors&#146; community leadership and is welcome, and that it would ensure that the duty would not be overly prescriptive and would be based on council best practice. We concur with that, and I hope that we will be able to demonstrate that that is the approach we have adopted.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggested that we should put&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09011936000065"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09011936000135"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> The Minister is emphasising that the Government are not going to be overprescriptive, yet later we come to the clause where they have the right to give as much guidance as they like to local authorities about what they do.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000066"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09011936000136"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> When we come to that clause, we will discuss the nature of that guidance, what might go into it, why it is important to have that power and why local government will be helped by it. We can debate that when we come to it.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggested that we should throw all these back to the process in the community engagement White Paper. This grew out of that White Paper because the Councillors Commission formed the basis of it and what we took forward. In addition, the Local Government Information Unit, which is not shy about challenging our proposals, welcomes the duty to promote democracy and recognises the influence on these duties of two independent reviews: the All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group&#146;s inquiry into the role of local councillors and the Councillors Commission.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000068"></a>What is the accumulated evidence that all those inquiries and bodies have unveiled? The Councillors Commission review recognised the importance of awareness of what councillors do. The evidence for action, presented to us by Jane Roberts, was overwhelming.  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>An Ipsos MORI survey for the Local Government Association shows that only 32 per cent of people know, or know a fair amount about, what their council does. The two-tier authorities are in a more complex position. Research by Hands in 2007 showed a lack of awareness of the role of the councillor and confusion with the almighty &#147;counsellor&#148;. Struggling with that confusion is at heart of this proposal. My noble friend Lord Borrie spoke about the accumulated evidence of voter turn-out, about which we are all deeply concerned. The All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group, in its March 2007 inquiry into of the role of councillors, identified a lack of awareness of the councillor&#146;s role as a key barrier to attracting potential councillors and proposed greater action from local authorities in attracting people to stand as local councillors. Perhaps I may sum this up with a quote from Jane Roberts&#146; report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011936000103"></a>&#147;People are unlikely to feel a sense of engagement with something they do not understand. The starting point for facilitating engagement locally is through communication&#148;.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000069"></a>In response, the commission&#146;s primary recommendation was that there should be a statutory duty on all principal authorities to facilitate democratic engagement by proactively disseminating clear and accessible information on how local governance works and what councils and councillors do; by facilitating more active civic participation; and by raising interest in and promoting the role of councillor, how to become a councillor and the activities of elected members.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000070"></a>We have specified some duties, but local authorities are able to determine the most appropriate ways to fulfil them for their local area. I am sure that they will build on the embedded work that already takes place to promote elections and community empowerment, using the techniques that they have already established. They will work with different partners in different ways.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000071"></a>We have made specific effort to keep the amount of detail in the legislation to a minimum. We have not specified, other than very broadly, the information that needs to be provided. However, we have had to build in safeguards. Much of the detail is about protecting local authorities rather than getting them to follow some strict, detailed prescription. We are very much aware of this.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000072"></a>My noble friend Lord Woolmer said that people grasp single issues because they either do not want to, or cannot, wrestle with the complex interrelationships of what the local authority does. Often, some of the solutions to those single issues can be achieved only if one understands the context in which the decision or situation concerned is being worked out.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000073"></a>Taking all this together, we want to encourage local government to be more confident and ensure that people know about local government processes and how to get involved. We want it to be available across the country. We have some outstanding local authorities which do excellent work. I know at first hand the work that is done in Essex, for example, which is the patch of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. It is an example to many parts of the country. However, as my noble friends have said, many local councils do not do this work very well and some not at all. That is the principal

We must have a genuinely fair way for people to access information and, therefore, democracy.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000074"></a>The Government are very cautious about imposing new duties on local government because we know the consequences. We have seen a huge improvement in services due to investment and changing practices. That is to the great credit of local government. There has been a massive increase in the quality of service, but, as my noble friend Lord Borrie pointed out, paradoxically, this has not been followed by a corresponding rise in the reputation of local government or the respect in which it is held. These are serious and debilitating difficulties if we look forward to what local government has to achieve in the next 50 years.</p>
<h5><a name="09011936000112"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000075"></a>Among other things, that obviously means that local government cannot recruit new members easily. It is neither young enough nor diverse enough to represent the full community and is more likely to be criticised than celebrated for what it is doing. That divergence between what the community thinks it needs and what it thinks that local government is doing is growing. That is not only of concern to this party or this Government. It is a serious issue which we must address.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000076"></a>We have moved away from swathes of targets for local authorities and towards local area agreements and local determination. We have moved from ring-fencing to flexible budgets. We can see the result in better relationships between central and local government. All that is excellent, and this is a complementary step to it. We want to make it transparent and clear, and enable councillors to do so, that the council is intent on working with the local community in terms of informing people about the actual processes as well as the likely outcomes: the work of councillors and how local people can get a grip on what is going on.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, asked how we could guarantee that there will be a difference. Well, one difference is that we ought to be able to guarantee that people in Pendle will have a map, a central point of information, an access point that will enable them to understand more about these relationships and how a democratic opportunity exists not just in the local authority but in the partnerships and partner authorities&#151;to which we will come in later amendments&#151;to influence change and get involved.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000078"></a>It may take some time, but we will know if the ultimate goal is working when we start to see a greater number and diversity of people getting involved and standing for civic roles; not just councillors but a different sort of person standing for the local PCT or PTA. We must challenge the sort of usual suspects who are likely to come forward.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000079"></a>The IDeA&#146;s biannual national census of local authorities and councils will help to track the effect. The quarterly citizenship survey includes questions on civic participation and activism. We can use that for measuring achievement against PSA15, which is about citizenship involvement. We will track it through the comprehensive areas assessment, where local authorities have responded. This will not completely disappear into the ether.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000080"></a>The duties set out in Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 are therefore placed on the local authorities. We are talking about a genuine culture change, but it is not a new concept. Local government has responded positively to the duty to involve in the 2007 Act, which comes into force in April. In the Bill we are taking the next step to ensure that people not only have the opportunity to be involved, but to act on that because they know how to. As I said, it is about building on the best work and creating opportunities. Essentially, however, it means that, as the Councillors Commission recognised, the duty itself requires a duty rather than an aspiration. That will means that it is explicit and clear in its requirements, fair to all, consistently and effectively applied, and affordable. That is why we have framed the duties as we have, and why we are providing funding to all local authorities to allow them to discharge these duties properly.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000081"></a>In place of that, Members of the Committee opposite have reached for a much weaker formula in Amendment 21 that gives a get-out clause to councils so that they can argue that the costs of this new role are simply too expensive. Well, I have ensured that the Bill allocates a reasonable sum, which has been worked out in conjunction with the advice of local authorities themselves, so that the councils can meet this new duty. They will receive the sum in their settlements once the duty is in place. Much of the work will be embedded in, and build on, what is already happening. It will be up to local authorities to use that money in the most effective way possible, so an additional measure in the Bill to determine whether costs are reasonable is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000082"></a>I turn finally to Amendments 1, 22, 59 and 60. Both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord are suggesting that we do not require a local authority to do anything but have,</p>
<ul><a name="09011936000108"></a>&#147;regard to the desirability of promoting&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011936000101"></a>understanding. This undermines the intention of the duties and the power of what we are trying to do. It would not impose any duty on the local authorities to do anything. I imagine that the noble Lords have in mind a duty for local authorities to have regard to the desirability of promoting democracy, but this is not an adequate substitute for a clear and unambiguous duty, as my noble friends have said, to take specific actions. In any event, there are many functions of the authority which do not obviously lend themselves to the promotion of democracy, such as rubbish collection. We cannot accept these clauses, which would render the duty nugatory.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000083"></a>Amendments 2, 21, 23 and 61 on our requirement on local authorities seek to qualify the duty by adding that local authorities must use &#147;reasonable endeavours&#148;. We have been purposely silent on how local authorities will fulfil their duties in relation to promotion of democracy. That is right and responsive to local government itself. We want it to be as flexible as possible. The duties as drafted leave it to the local authority to judge how best to discharge this duty without incurring unreasonable cost. We have not prescribed how they will promote democratic understanding, or later&#151;when we turn to Clauses 3 and 4&#151;promote the roles of lay justices, members of

We trust local authorities to make sensible and proportionate decisions about how best to promote democratic understanding in their areas. We are seeking a power to issue guidance, because it will help local authorities to proceed in a logical and supported fashion. This will be flexible in approach to the duty and will encourage the imaginative and innovative responses based on best practice.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000084"></a>I apologise for speaking at such length but, as this matter is so fundamental to the Bill, it is worth having the debate. I quite understand that this is new territory and absolutely appropriate to raise&#151;</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000087"></a>It is absolutely appropriate for a duty on the new landscape in which we are working, across boundaries and in relation to the extension of local government autonomy that has been achieved and the huge and growing responsibilities that it undertakes. All that impacts on how local people are served, the range and type of services they can expect and how the place they live in is being shaped and changed. Indeed, it feeds the new appetite for influence. Members of the Committee are right when they say that people want to become involved. In my home town, which is a transition town, the community is alive to the sorts of decisions that local government must make if we are move to a low-carbon economy. People are looking for influence. This is about giving them some new choice and access. It is a proportionate approach. The duty plus the local discretion will achieve the right balance.</p>

First, I respond to the challenge of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, who suggested that because I had been a councillor for rather a long time, I am perhaps a little resistant to change. The record will not show that he said that with a smile on his face, and I hope that he was not too serious.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000089"></a>There is nothing in this part of the Bill that represents a challenge either to me or to the local authority on which I sit. Certainly, my authority has been undertaking all the significant measures in here since shortly after the Liberal Democrats won control of it in 1986. Most of what we implemented in the 1980s we probably took from a handbook written by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in a previous incarnation. There is no challenge here, and neither I nor my colleagues are in any way resistant to what is in it. Our resistance, if resistance it is, is to the fact that it is in a Bill, not to the suggestions of what we should do.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000090"></a>All good authorities, of all political persuasions and none, have, I hope, been promoting local democracy for many years. For many years, we have had increasingly better schemes for receiving petitions, as my noble friend Lord Greaves made clear. Certainly, over my time in local government, the opportunities for involvement in local democracy have increased hugely and people have taken advantage of that. We have had

I wish that I had brought my book of London election results with me. I looked before the Second Reading debate and turnouts now are not much different&#151;in fact they are slightly higher&#151;from the 1960s and 1970s in London. My noble friend Lord Greaves tells me that it is very similar in the rest of the country. They rose to a peak in 1990. Polling day in 1990 was a sunny day and there was also a change to local government finance at that time which was causing a degree of controversy.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000091"></a>In all of this, my noble friends and I hope that we are not giving any impression of complacency or the feeling that we do not think there is a problem. I acknowledged at Second Reading and I will do so again now that there is a problem. My noble friends and I have spent most of our adult lives trying to promote active and participatory democracy. I certainly do not feel that I have succeeded yet&#151;far from it. It happens much less than it ought to. In part, our difficulty is not in acknowledging the problem, which is widely recognised in the debate that we have had in Committee, but in identifying the best solutions. I am far from convinced, frankly, that doing what is in the Bill, which many good authorities have been doing in one way or another for years, sadly without enough effect, is actually the right solution.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011936000092"></a>Perhaps this is not the time and place for a long debate about the right solution, but our problem is not what is in the Bill but the fact that it is in a Bill. It is much better left to local authorities to continue to develop their own schemes for local participation and to strive for that end as all good local authorities do. I acknowledge that there are poor local authorities, probably under the control of all parties and they are as much condemned by the good authorities that they are letting down as by any Minister, civil servant or Member of either House of Parliament. We will continue this debate for many hours to come in some detail, but I hope that I have set out our position a little more clearly. I am pleased to see that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, is nodding in assent. I have achieved one objective, at least.</p>

It has been an extremely informative start. We heard about the number of years that various members of the Committee had served&#151;35 years by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and 31 years by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh. Indeed, there was reference to papers being written by the noble Lords, Lord Tope and Lord Greaves, although we did not quite get to the bottom of who wrote which paper and who put their name to it. What interests and intrigues me is that papers were being written while I was still in nappies.</p>

<p><a name="09011936000095"></a>There was also reference to the wording of the amendments drafted by us. I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that I do not think that there is a civil servant in me. I may have an inner lawyer in the way that I have drafted these particular amendments. However, I would say to the Minister that there may be an inner conflict in her comments. On the one

However, Clauses 1 and 2 are quite prescriptive and detailed about what that duty should be. Therefore, the &#147;how&#148; is not being left to local authorities. There was some suggestion that the way in which Amendment 1 had been drafted was effectively destructive and destroyed the original clause. Well that is an idea. We may bring it back in another form at Report. However, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

If Clause 1 is to be in the Bill, there is a striking omission: the role and duties of a local authority councillor. It was said in the previous debate that that is still little understood. In my experience, that is so in all sorts of ways. Good councils of all persuasions are now operating shadow councillor schemes. I have been shadowed myself by a number of people who are not necessarily interested in becoming a councillor but who are interested in knowing more about what is involved and how the system works. It seems to me, and to my noble friend in whose name the amendment stands, that a very important part of the duties here should be the duty to promote a better understanding of the work and role of a councillor, which is inherent in understanding the democratic functioning of local government. I believe that the Bill would benefit from an explicit reference to that.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000002"></a>Amendment 7 requires local authorities to set out, as part of this instructive process, their arrangements for consultation. I would make a distinction between consultation, conducted under a number of options, any one of which might be adopted, and public information, which is sometimes called consultation, but which is much more about explaining to people why something has to happen, whether they are wholly in favour of it or not. It is setting out arrangements, explaining to people how a local authority takes its decisions, who takes the decisions and how the public may express their views and influence decisions. That is the purpose of Amendments 3 and 7. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000003"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09011945000056"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Apart from Amendment 77, which is slightly different, I have Amendments 4, 6, 13, 26 and 28 in this group. Effectively, they are all the same but relate to different parts of Chapter 1. I shall deal with Amendment 77 first, which I tabled because there appears to be some duplication in the Bill. In Clause 9  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at the end of Chapter 1 there are definitions of &#147;principal local authority&#148;, &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; and &#147;local people&#148;, which, according to the clause, all have,</p>
<ul><a name="09011945000046"></a>&#147;the meaning given by section 1&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011945000039"></a>I imagined that the definitions refer to Clause 1, but they do not. The definitions in Clause 1 refer to the full definitions of &#147;principal local authority&#148;, &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; and &#147;local people&#148; and apply to the whole chapter, so the definitions of those three phrases appear twice in the same chapter. To encourage the Government to make the Bill three lines shorter, I have tabled Amendment 77. The Government could make my day and accept it, although it would not make any difference to anything because it is there already.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000004"></a>The other amendments relate to adding the words &#147;and decision making&#148; to wherever the phrase &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; occurs in Chapter 1 to make it mean what the Minister has said it means. Clause 1(3) defines &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; as being,</p>
<ul><a name="09011945000047"></a>&#147;arrangements for members of the public to participate in, or influence, the making of decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011945000040"></a>There is a wide range of agreement in the Committee that we want to see the promotion of those arrangements, which in general terms is very good, but it is a slightly odd definition of democracy. There is no doubt in my mind that encouraging people to take part in local governance in all sorts of ways&#151;going to council meetings and taking part, going to public meetings and going to the kind of meetings which the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, was talking about&#151;is all part and parcel of democracy. But it is only part of democracy. The real bases for the structure of local democracy are elected local councils, as my noble friend just said. Without elected local councils, there would be no democratic structure for anyone to take part in. It is an odd definition of democratic arrangements, but I will not quibble because what is being put forward is a good thing.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000005"></a>However, it is clear from discussion on the previous group of amendments that what is being proposed here is a duty on local authorities to set out the map for the structure of local governance in the area. The decision-making systems have to be set out and explained and people have to understand them before they can sensibly take part in them. That is the noble Baroness&#146;s argument. But it does not say that here. It says that there is a duty to promote arrangements for members of the public to participate in the making of decisions. All that I am doing is adding the structure of the decision-making system to this part of the Bill that has to be explained and put forward to promote understanding of it.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000006"></a>People first need to know how decisions are made and who makes them. When people know that, they can settle to and try to influence those decisions. If they do not know how the decisions are made and who makes them, they just fire off letters to the local press attacking everybody regardless of who does what. The week before last, I went to a meeting of a body called Lancashire Local&#151;Pendle&#151;I do not understand why Lancashire County Council puts adjectives and nouns the wrong way round these days, but it is a bit like Team GB, I suppose. Lancashire Local&#151;Pendle is a six-weekly meeting that Lancashire County Council  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>holds for the district of Pendle. It holds one for each of the 12 districts in the county at which local things are discussed. Anything that the county is doing can be discussed and a few things have been devolved to these meetings to be decided. It is a joint committee consisting of all the county councillors representing the borough and the same number of borough councillors in each county. It is a step forward towards devolution in a very widespread county.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000007"></a>At this meeting, a gentleman made a vitriolic attack on Pendle Borough Council and Pendle councillors for the appalling mess that we had made, he said, of clearing the snow and ice in the bad weather we had before Christmas. The service that was put forward in Pendle was appalling&#151;far worse than it has ever been in the past&#151;but it was the responsibility of Lancashire County Council. It used to be run by Pendle. Two years ago, the county took the service back despite vigorous opposition from people including me&#151;the whole of Pendle Borough Council, in fact. Nevertheless, we had it taken from us. The county said &#147;No, we&#146;ll do it. We&#146;ll do a much better job&#148;, and they made a complete botch of it. But the person who stood up and the various people who complained to the paper attacked Pendle Borough Council. Unless you know who does what, you do not know where, as the Government would say, to engage with the system. The purpose of the amendments is entirely constructive. It is an attempt to make this part of the Bill say what I understand the Government mean it to say.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000008"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09011945000057"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I have one amendment in this group, Amendment 25, by which I simply seek to build on my earlier comments and those of the noble Lords, Lord Tope and Lord Greaves. Clause 2 places a duty on the local authority to promote understanding of the functions of connected authorities. The Bill then goes on to list a great number of bodies, organisations, agencies, authorities and, perhaps I may say, quangos. My Amendment 25 is designed to emphasise the tenuous democratic nature of all those organisations because they do not enjoy democratic arrangements at all. The nature of these bodies is that someone else controls them. Someone else appoints their members, and someone else controls their budgets and priorities. That someone else may be the Secretary of State, but it is certainly not local voters. If the Government wish local authorities to promote understanding of these bodies, it is not unreasonable to ask them to put an extra paragraph on the Explanatory Notes pointing out that neither they nor the voters have very much to say on what goes on in these authorities. Indeed, I was almost minded to champion this clause, rather than seek to amend it, because if an understanding of the true democratic nature of these bodies was enthusiastically and honestly promoted, a backlash would surely arise when voters were made fully aware of just how impotent they actually are.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000009"></a>We have consistently argued against the creation of new quangos and criticised their lack of accountability. If the Government are serious about engaging local voters, boosting local democracy and encouraging people to participate, this lack of accountability will have to be properly addressed. Until they are ready to address that real issue, we might as well be honest about the current reality.</p>

May I say how pleased I am to see that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has joined us, and how much I appreciated working with him for so long? I am sure he will enjoy his Back-Bench career, being able to get involved in some of the things he was not able to before. It is very nice to see him taking part in the Committee.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000011"></a>This group of amendments focuses on the scope of the duties in Clauses 1 and 2. They seek to probe exactly what kinds of information councils should be providing. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore some of those issues, which have been very well raised for their salience.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000012"></a>The intent behind the amendments is, clearly, to ensure that the scope of the clauses is as comprehensive as is appropriate. I am happy to explain how I think the existing clauses already cover what noble Lords want to see. I shall do that very briefly, as I do not want to repeat anything that I said in the long debate that we have just had.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000013"></a>The intent behind Clauses 1 and 2, and the text, make it clear that, based on all the evidence that I have brought forward, we believe it is important for people to be genuinely and not just nominally involved in decision-making. That is why we have been so intent in our community empowerment White Paper on the need to shift power, influence and responsibility, and give communities more purchase on that. There is a long history behind that; the Councillors Commission showed that there is a fundamental failure of communication between most local councils in explaining how their councils work and what they are responsible for&#151;and I thought that the example of Pendle was extremely telling&#151;as well as who takes the decisions, at what level and how they are taken. What are the processes? Is it a committee structure or a small sub-group, and is it possible to get into these meetings? How can decisions be changed? Those are clearly among the most insuperable barriers to people becoming more involved.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000014"></a>We know that people want to know these things and think that there should be involvement. I saw some extremely interesting new polling from Ipsos MORI just last week, demonstrating the sheer enthusiasm that people have for getting involved. I do not think that it has been published yet, but it was extremely graphic about the real interest there is in local issues and involvement. That is not something that we are struggling with alone in Britain. The Councillors Commission reviewed international evidence. I was in Australia over Christmas and spent a morning&#151;which I did not expect&#151;talking to councillors in New South Wales about their attempt to try to re-engage better with local communities.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000015"></a>The only people who can make this happen are councillors. They have new forms of access to information that have completely revolutionised the way in which they communicate with local people. But where access is denied, people are being left out of the loop. Increasing and improving information on what they do, how and why is the business of this Bill and of local councillors.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000016"></a>Let us begin with the information that can and should be made available. I pay tribute to the many excellent councillors who are doing their best, but we need to ensure that in &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; we have all the elements necessary to make the difference as regards what people know and how they can use the information. On Amendment 77, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right that it is not essential to have the provision in lines 23 to 25. It was merely intended to be helpful and to put all the definitions together in the same place. If he will leave the matter with me, I will see whether there is a point to be addressed. I can assure him that I am game for anything that can shorten the Bill.</p>
<h5><a name="09011945000052"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000017"></a>I sympathise with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, wanted to achieve in Amendments 4, 6, 13, 26 and 28. I assure him that the scope of the definition in subsection (3), which defines &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; as,</p>
<ul><a name="09011945000048"></a>&#147;arrangements for members of the public to participate in, or influence, the making of decisions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09011945000041"></a>already meets his intentions. It will certainly mean that councils have to act to increase public knowledge and understanding of how public bodies approach and make decisions; to make it clear who is making which decisions on behalf of the public; and the way in which people can get involved. By requiring councillors to explain how people can get involved in the decision-making process, it must necessarily involve an explanation of what the processes are and who takes which type of decision. The provisions also specifically require councillors to explain their role&#151;what is involved in being a councillor&#151;and the functions of the council. Departing from my brief, I think that subsection (1)(b), relates also to the decisions taken by a principal local authority and the way in which it takes them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000018"></a>Amendments 26 and 28 seek to ensure that councillors explain what kind of decision-making arrangements a connected authority has. That, too, is covered by the general set of definitions, but I shall say more about that on Amendment 25. I have to advise the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that some of the amendments may have the unintended consequence of widening the duty of explanation for areas which are inappropriate. The amendment seems to suggest that the council will have to explain its mechanisms for all types of decision-making, not just those of a policy nature which affect the public. Our policy is limited to the types of decision that, under Clause 1(3), fit under the definition,</p>
<ul><a name="09011945000049"></a>&#147;arrangements for members of the public to participate in, or influence, the making of decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011945000042"></a>When you broaden those types, you can bring in decisions which may be commercially sensitive or deal with disciplinary actions. We must therefore be extremely careful to draw that provision as specifically as possible. We do not want to catch a vast number of everyday decisions; for example, when to send out the gritting lorries.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000019"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09011945000059"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am sorry, but that is exactly the kind of decision that gets people most worked up. In the previous debate, the noble Baroness said that the  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>duties do not lend themselves to democratic involvement in rubbish collection. I must point out that rubbish collection and all the related issues of recycling attract the greatest democratic involvement. I therefore think that the noble Baroness is wrong on some of these issues.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000020"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09011945000060"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I must confess that as soon as I heard myself saying that, I realised that it was a very bad example, as most probably was gritting lorries. Members of the Committee have already urged me to think about the matter, and I have said that the balance we are trying to achieve relates to it. We are not going to go into detail about the decisions, the areas of policy and so forth; we are making general requirements about the process. Clearly, the way in which it impacts on the different types of services and decisions will vary, but we are dealing with the way in which the decisions are taken. We must therefore be careful that we do not broaden the clause inappropriately and accidentally.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000021"></a>Amendment 3, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, extends the argument into the detail of the councillors&#146; work to add to the main duty in Clause 1 the requirement to promote the understanding of the duty of members of the authority as democratically elected representatives. He is right that it is important that that is understood. I believe that any duty to promote democracy worth its salt would include a requirement to explain to people about this role. We have already included it in Clause 1(2)(b) which requires councillors to promote the understanding of what councillors do. I believe that that is properly encompassed there and will include an explanation of their formal responsibilities and duties.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90119-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000022"></a>Amendment 7 ensures that the clause will enable people to contribute their views and requires councillors to explain how they do that. We agree that the intention behind this amendment is absolutely right. It is essential that people understand how their council will consult them and take their views seriously not only so that challenges can be taken up more easily but so that it is transparent if a councillor is not doing enough in this area. Clause 1(3)(d) covers consultation because our definition of democratic arrangements is the arrangements for members of the public to participate in or influence the making of decisions. &#147;Influencing&#148; clearly includes doing that via the consultation processes. I am very sympathetic to the spirit of these amendments, so I am happy to put on the record that these clauses encompass what noble Lords want to achieve. I am also determined that there should not be any doubt about that.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000023"></a>However, for all the reasons noble Lords have already given, we do not want to overload the Bill with detail, so we will set out in guidance the scope and the processes that will be covered in relation to the amendments. That will be useful. We will make it clear that we would like councillors to explain how councils and connected authorities work to involve the public and the different ways in which they do so.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000024"></a>In response to Amendment 25, I shall elaborate on what I have briefly stressed. I am not sure whether respectable and important democratic bodies, such as the Broads Authority, parish councils or strategic health authorities, would want to be dismissed as undemocratic

If she believes they are so undemocratic, it is important that the point of the Bill is to open up these processes so that people know who is on them representing the community, how they can be most effective and how they can be expanded. It is something that the bodies in question are sympathetic to. We have liaised with the relevant bodies to ensure that the connected authorities are signed up to carrying out their role. When we come on to those amendments, I will explain why the list is as it is. These bodies are keen to promote their work and their civic roles to a wider audience. Why should they not be when so much of their work can be made more effective if the local community knows what they do and supports them in it?</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000025"></a>We have no reason to believe that they will not co-operate fully to explain the nature of their democratic arrangements. Should such a conflict arise, we have kept a reserve power for the Secretary of State to use if absolutely necessary, which appears in Clause 5(3), but we fully expect the information they provide to be information they already have to hand and want to disseminate to a wider audience. We are happy for councils to use website links and other technological solutions to ensure that there is no duplication. We will use the guidance to make sure that connected authorities&#146; functions and decisions are explained in an accessible way.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000026"></a>In conclusion, the provisions in Clauses 1 and 2 work together to ensure that the way in which councils and the connected authorities make decisions, what they do, which of those decisions are made by those in civic roles and which by employees, will all be encompassed by this duty. I hope noble Lords are persuaded of that because these are important issues. We are happy to try to meet the intent of the amendments in that way.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000027"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011945000061"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I listened with care to what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said&#151;I enjoyed his example about snow clearing&#151;and I listened with care to what the Minister said. Some time ago, the Minister and I both sat in a Committee on a Bill when I challenged the optimism with which the Government were reviewing the immediate future of the economy. One day, I shall look at precisely what the Minister said, but she implied that I had totally the wrong end of the stick and that the economy was in extraordinarily good shape. Events, on the whole, have betrayed her. She is exercising the same degree of optimism about what will happen as a result of this legislation.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000028"></a>I may be suffering from an experience similar to that described by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the responsibility for snow clearing changing hands. I live in an authority which is undergoing the transition into a unitary authority, instead of a series of district councils, a decision which was not reached democratically on the ground, but which was imposed from elsewhere. I would not say that people where I live could answer an examination question on who is responsible for what now, but I am absolutely clear that the consequence of change is that it will be a long time before they work out who is responsible for what under the new system. I am hesitant about how well all this will work.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000029"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09011945000062"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I have two main points. Early in her reply, whether to my amendments or not, the Minister said that if people do not know who makes the decisions or how the system works that is an insuperable barrier to getting involved. I do not think that is so. It may be the case, but in many instances people do not decide they want to get involved over a particular issue or under some initiative to encourage them to get involved and then say what they are interested in or concerned about. Sometimes they do that in quite an inappropriate place, having regard to the way in which the system works technically, but they are pointed in the right direction or their concerns are pursued in the right channels, although initially they do not have a clue who does what. It is not true to say that getting involved is impossible if you do not know who is responsible for the recycling or gritting or the allocation of funds to schools or whatever. Once you start to get involved, you find your way around the system and there are plenty of people to help you.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000030"></a>It is important not to deny that the central part of Chapter 1, the idea of providing people with the information about who does what in their area, is a good idea. I want to be quite clear about that. I am not in any way saying that that should not be done, but I just think that five pages of detailed primary legislation is not the way to do it.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000031"></a>My second point relates to my amendments and decision-making. I thank the Minister for looking at the duplication issue. This is a crucial definition. It is the definition which forms the keystone to this chapter because the whole chapter is about promoting understanding in these democratic arrangements. The definition, as set out here, is not satisfactory. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09011945000050"></a>&#147;&#145;democratic arrangements&#146; means arrangements for members of the public to participate in, or influence, the making of decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011945000043"></a>It does not say that it includes an explanation of the decision-making system in which they can get involved. If you want to get involved in things, you cannot necessarily turn up to a meeting and have your say because the decision may be delegated to an officer in the authority, or to another body, or to a private-sector body which may be doing it on behalf of the council. However, there are almost always ways in which you can, if you wish, have an influence, if only by writing a letter to the person who makes the decision or by getting some other body which does not actually have responsibility for making the decision to agree with you and pass on your views as part of the process of influencing the decision. What is in the Bill is therefore unsatisfactory as a crucial, central definition.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000032"></a>It occurred to me when the Minister was talking that I had put down the wrong amendment. I should not have attempted to write &#147;decision-making&#148; everywhere, but simply have changed the definition of &#147;democratic arrangements&#148;. The Minister said that she did not want to broaden it accidentally to include, for example, disciplinary procedures, appointing the caretaker, matters of commercial confidentiality et cetera. However, the advice that she is getting is contrary to normal practice and experience in local government. Local government is so at ease with the system that it operates that there some matters that, if they come to committee, are usually called &#147;part 2 items&#148;; that is, decisions that are  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not made in the glare of publicity, and are not open to the press and public because they may be commercially sensitive or to do with individuals and their circumstances, be they personnel matters or otherwise. That applies right the way through. The distinction is very well understood in local government and at officer level. If I as a councillor try to put influence on an officer who has to take one of those decisions, I may well be out of order&#151;although I may be able to put in some influence in other cases. That distinction is therefore is very clearly understood in local government. Setting out the decision-making system in no way broadens the ability of people to interfere in matters which are by their very nature inappropriate for general public debate.</p>
<h5><a name="09011945000053"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000033"></a>Even where there are issues such as that&#151;for example, those which are commercially confidential or related to personnel, it does not stop the authority writing that down as part of the definition of the decision-making system. If part of the decision-making system is inaccessible to the general public for very good reasons, that is information that they should have, not least because they will then know that they cannot turn up and talk about the matter at a meeting and that, if they try to do so, they will, one hopes, be prevented by the chairman.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000034"></a>I do not think that I am pushing the matter too far with the amendment. The definition in the Bill is not appropriate for what the Government are trying to do. I am trying to be helpful to the Government; I am not trying to be destructive. I would ask the Minister to look specifically at that decision to see whether it can encompass what we all want to see; namely, the map produced.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000035"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09011945000063"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I am pleased that the Minister has recognised, albeit slightly too late for her own good, the huge political significance of refuse collection and gritting schedules. No councillor of any experience would ever change a refuse collection schedule shortly before an election; those who have done it have learned why they should not have. I see lots of nods of assent around the Room. I am afraid that it is reality.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000036"></a>My noble friend Lord Greaves explained the position very well. I simply endorse what he said about what, as far as I am aware, is certainly common practice throughout local government. We may need to give a little more attention to it. On the amendments in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Hamwee to which I spoke, particularly those relating to the role of councillors, I understand that it is the intention they are covered by other subsections. By normal interpretation, they probably are, but what councillors do is so little understood&#151;sometimes by councillors themselves&#151;that we need to give more attention to it. Councillors generally&#151;I am getting into difficult ground&#151;are getting older and it is becoming more difficult, for various reasons, including pressures of everyday life, to attract younger people from different communities, so that we have a much more diverse representation among councillors. A number of authorities are trying hard to address those problems with limited success. In the context of this Bill and what we seek to achieve, we

In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09011945000037"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09011945000065"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> This amendment focuses for the first time in this Committee on local partnerships, which are extremely important as part of local governance. They hardly existed 20 years ago. All the signs are that they will not go away, but will become more important. It is impossible to draw a sensible map of the system of local governance without including all the partnership arrangements and partnership bodies, some of which exist as statutory bodies and some of which do not. Some just exist and have come about on a voluntary basis. The Government may say that they exist on a voluntary basis but local strategic partnerships are not really voluntary bodies. The Government say that we have to have them, but they have no basis in local government law. They play a different part in different areas, but they are important pretty well everywhere. Amendment 5 refers to local strategic partnerships and to crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Crime and disorder reduction partnerships are statutory bodies, but they are still partnerships of local bodies.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011945000038"></a>A few years ago, as these bodies were burgeoning, my noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland, while he was still a councillor, asked the chief executive of Calderdale Council in west Yorkshire to draw up a list of all the partnerships, local trusts and similar bodies on which that council had representation, and there were more than 100 bodies. How local decisions are made cannot be described without including them. Some of us would call it the local &#147;quangocracy&#148; and we may think that they have gone too far. However, following the previous legislation that we discussed in the Moses Room, changes to LSPs and local area agreements have probably improved matters and have put the council more at the centre of what is going on than it was.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000004"></a>Nevertheless, it is complex and, for the purpose of the amendment, it exists. There are very often opportunities within these partnerships for people to go along and take part. Some of them are distinctly unfriendly and secretive in how they take decisions, while others&#151;LSPs, for example&#151;may have sub-committees, working groups or local forums set up under the auspices of the LSP, which are specifically  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there to involve people. So it is ludicrous to leave them out. Crime reduction partnerships are there to involve people, and people can go along and take part in them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000005"></a>So there are opportunities, although LSPs exist in a sort of vacuum. They remind me of the old rhyme:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011947000147"></a>&#147;Yesterday upon the stair,</p>
I met a man who wasn't there.He wasn't there again todayI wish that man would go away&#148;.
<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000006"></a>LSPs are a bit like that&#151;they are there, even when they are not there, in the legislation&#151;and they are important.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000007"></a>Amendment 20 simply attempts to define a partnership for this purpose. I am not at all sure that it is the right definition, but I could not find the definition of a partnership in relation to local government in any legislation. The Minister may be able to tell me where it is, but I could not find it. So I am suggesting that a partnership means,</p>
<ul><a name="09011947000148"></a>&#147;a non-corporate body or trust whose membership includes the principal local authority and in whose democratic and decision-making structures the authority is represented whether by members or officer or both&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011947000139"></a>I am quite sure that it should be there, however the Government feel that it should be defined. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000008"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09011947000175"></a>Lord Smith of Leigh:</b> The first partnership that I got involved with in my career was the City Challenge Board, which the Conservative Government insisted that we set up to get some money. We were always a very pragmatic authority. If there was any money involved and we were asked to set up a partnership, we would do that if we could get the money.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000009"></a>The noble Lord makes a point about the distinction between voluntary and statutory bodies, because that is not as clear as it might be. LSPs are now major players in monitoring local area agreements, so they do have a role. However, I did not understand what he said about partnerships within an authority area. If we try to map governance, in a sense there are partnerships beyond an authority&#146;s area&#151;sometimes in collaboration, formal or informal, with other local authorities, and sometimes with other bodies and private sector organisations within a wider field.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000010"></a>If we are trying to do something that people understand and which means something, my only concern is that we need to ensure we are talking about significant rather than marginal things. Otherwise, there will just be a complex geography map that no one will understand, not least those of us who are actively involved in local government. We need to bear in mind that, if we want something that will mean something and will help people get round the difficulties within local government, it has to be reasonably simple.</p>

It includes the memorable moment in Waziristan when a group of officers who are planning an attack on a rebel leader meet to discuss the plan. The father of the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, produces the memorable sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011947000149"></a>&#147;The British army is always required to fight uphill and at the juncture of the two or more maps&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000140"></a>The problem of the two or more maps is one which all of us who have had to deal with these things is familiar.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000013"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on the basis of another analogy. I was once responsible for securing the appointment of the chief executive of a Great British company to the board of another Great British company, but one which was in a technical field outside his own direct experience. At the end of his first board meeting, he told the secretary that the board&#146;s agenda contained 89 acronyms that meant something to people in the company and that unless he was provided with a lexicon for them before the next meeting he would not bother to attend. In producing the lexicon, the secretary apologised because he had had to make inquiries about 55 of the 89 acronyms about which the chief executive had complained. There is an argument in favour of this sort of information being available. We cannot expect councillors to pass it on unless they have the information in the first place.</p>
<h5><a name="09011947000166"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09011947000014"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09011947000178"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> We have touched on a fertile seam about partnerships, which will return in later groups&#151;for example, when we look at Amendments 47, 48 and 57. I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, made about the acronyms that now clutter the important partnerships. The range of partnerships has evolved over the past few years to deliver services that may previously have been delivered separately and to bring people together who may have been doing much the same job with different sorts of funding in different parts of the local authority. This growth in partnership has been necessary and evolutionary, and is a progressive way forward. It is a factor to be reckoned with and, in the context of what we want to achieve in Clauses 1 and 2, we have to be sure that people are aware of the range of mechanisms that shape, influence and deliver local services. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was right to bring this forward.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000015"></a>Many of them are done through partnerships, and the LSP is critical to that. We encouraged that in the local government White Paper, <I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>, and in the report of the Lyons inquiry into the future of local government. They are a fundamental part of the way in which councils, the police and other bodies make joint decisions about services that affect people and they play a key role in identifying local authority and policy responses through the LSP. LSPs are challenging organisations that have a uniquely important role because they bring so many statutory and voluntary agencies together. When they work, they work extremely effectively. As well as the  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>LSPs, there is a range of specific partnerships to co-ordinate services for children or older people, or to regenerate an area within the local authority, as well as the crime and disorder partnerships that the noble Lord has already identified.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000016"></a>I am in sympathy with what he is addressing. However, we do not need additions to the duties to bring them within scope. Before I go on with that, in the past two debates I have been struck by the fact that noble Lords opposite are wrestling with what we wrestled with in framing the Bill. They want more detail and definition and for things to be clearer, but, at the same time, they do not want to expand the Bill. That would be the effect of putting some of this detail in it. In the first debate, the noble Lord was scathing about having eight or whatever pages on this, but in exploring these issues, we are exploring the necessity for the sort of detail that will enable people to get on and do the job without being hampered by confusions and ambiguities, and without overloading them by being overprescriptive.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000017"></a>While other partnerships and bodies may or may not be part of the formal decision-making mechanisms of the council, they fall within the definition of arrangements that the council has made to enable people to influence its decisions. For example, although LSP decision-making arrangements may not be the same as the council's decision-making process, the council will clearly be involved in what the LSP decides and therefore, so far as there are any arrangements for people to get involved in LSP decision-making, they would be covered by our duty.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000018"></a>That is the same answer that I gave to the previous set of amendments. They are covered by the duty, although not explicitly. The noble Lord is dissatisfied with that definition; I have listened to what he said. Essentially, it is part of the general values which we put on this activity and it is what we wanted to encompass. As such, when we ask local authorities to provide information on their functions and democratic arrangements, we consider that, and when we ask them to provide information on the functions and democratic arrangements of health, the police and the other connected authorities, we are asking them to include information on the partnerships in which they are involved.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000019"></a>On the final element of Amendment 5, the noble Lord proposes that local authorities should provide information on the democratic arrangements for other bodies in which the authority takes part and to which it has voluntarily devolved functions or in which it voluntarily shares functions with other participating bodies. We are not sure exactly what he means. If he is referring to delegated functions then that is not necessary as an authority has no power to delegate functions to any partnership. Where functions are delegated within the structure of the authority to officers, committees and members, the decisions made in this official capacity would already be covered by our definition of democratic arrangements.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000020"></a>So where local authorities have decided to contract out services to other providers, we would expect that the decisions made by the council about delivery of those services here&#151;say, bin collection&#151;would be

I am afraid to say &#147;bin collection&#148; in any context now, so I shall have to find a substitute. On the other hand, the service providers themselves are independent, possibly commercial, entities which do not have public functions and would not have democratic arrangements in which to be involved.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000021"></a>The noble Lord seeks to ensure that partnerships are included both within the requirement on local authorities set out in Clause 1(1) and by adding to the list of connected authorities. As I have said, we have covered that. We would expect local authorities to be sensible in how they interpret this so that if the decision-making of each individual participant is within our provisions, they would also include information about how they go about making decisions within the partnership itself.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000022"></a>That is why we think that guidance will be a help. It will allow us to provide a clear steer to local authorities about the scope of information we expect them to provide, which will include partnership working. It makes better sense to do that in guidance than to put that kind of detail in the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord agrees with me.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000023"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09011947000179"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that long reply. I am not sure I understood it all. I shall read it and the Bill again. My initial reaction is that her basic premise that it is all covered by the duty has not convinced me and I think it is probably wrong. I shall have another think and take further advice.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000024"></a>The first point made by the Minister was that we want more detail in a Bill which, as we have said, has too much detail. That is a theme through many of the amendments in this and the next chapter, which is about petitions. We would prefer that the Government did not legislate on either of these matters, but persuaded councils to do them in other ways. If you legislate, there is a choice: one is to have genuine, in-principle framework legislation. It is our view that each of these points could be reduced to half a page: we could get it down on the petitions one but not on this one, because we want to probe more on exactly what Chapter 1 means. Our view is that you can cut it down to half a page and say to councils, &#147;Get on with it and do it sensibly&#148;. They will do it in different ways, in different places, but it will be in line with local circumstances and in line with local democracy.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000025"></a>Some councils will do it a lot better than others, but that is what local democracy is all about. Some will want to spend a lot more money on it and do it really well. Others will want to spend the minimum amount of money to fulfil their legal obligations and no more. There will be very different ways of doing it. That seems to us to be the diversity that comes from genuine local democracy and the way it should be done. There is a genuine ideological difference between us on this. The Government want to legislate and tie everyone down more and more to a uniform system for everything in every detail. That seems to be what is going on. We are against that and the principle behind it.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000026"></a>However, if the Government are going to legislate in this kind of detail, we must cover all the eventualities and make it comprehensive. You must make it work so that people cannot come along and say, &#147;It does not

In particular, you must make sure that it will not get in the way of current good practice. Therefore, you have to make it longer. You cannot get away from that. At the moment we have a very unsatisfactory halfway house.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000027"></a>As far as partnerships are concerned, the Minister said that because a service is contracted out, there will therefore be no involvement in the service delivery, but that may not be the case at all. The contracting out of the service might include the involvement of some people who receive that service or some of the local people in the delivery of that service. It may involve consultation with local area committees or even town and parish councils in the delivery of that service. It is not automatically the case that, just because something is contracted out to the private or third sector, there is no public involvement. That is wrong.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000028"></a>The second part of the amendment was kite flying and probing, as the Minister understood. There are further discussions to be had. To return to the basic principle of partnerships, we feel that partnerships, although perhaps not in this wording or in quite so much detail, ought to be in the Bill. Just because a council is a member of a partnership that does not mean that everything that partnership does will necessarily be covered by this duty. Some things the partnership does may have nothing to do with the council. Nevertheless, because the partnership itself is a public body, it ought to be included in this duty. I would ask the Minister to think about that.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000029"></a>My final point is that some partnerships, as the Minister pointed out, are statutory partnerships. They have a freestanding existence in their own right. They are not part of the council. The council is one of the partners in that statutory partnership. In those circumstances, I am not sure that the duty given to the council will automatically fall on that partnership, because the council will have lots of other duties, in all sorts of ways, that do not fall on the partnership. Statutory partnerships, such as the crime and disorder partnerships, will be governed by the legislation setting them up, so this is also something that the Minister should think again about. We do not think that it is a difficult thing to include so we do not understand the reluctance. Having said that, there is scope for further discussion and debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000031"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09011947000182"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Amendment 8 is partly probing and partly in order to make an important point and to bring some of the discussions into the real world about how things actually happen on the ground. Amendment 8 refers to Clause 1(2) which includes a duty to promote understanding of how to become a member of an authority&#151;or councillor as it is more normally called&#151;of what councillors do and of what support is provided to councillors.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000032"></a>Amendment 8 is about the real world, in which most people, although by no means all, who stand for election to a council do so on behalf of a registered political party. It may be a national or purely local political party, a community group or a group set up to achieve certain local aims, such as when Boston Borough Council was taken over by the Boston Bypass Party, which was for the bypass, not against it. That was despite the fact that Boston Borough Council does not have the power to build a bypass because that is a county council function and Boston is in a two-tier area in Lincolnshire. Nevertheless, in order to have its name on the ballot paper and to promote itself in that way, it had to be registered as a political party. There are now many hundreds of political parties registered with the Electoral Commission. Most people stand for the main national political parties through their local branches.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000033"></a>Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1986 includes a prohibition on political publicity by local authorities:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011947000153"></a>&#147;A local authority shall not publish any material which, in whole or in part, appears to be designed to affect public support for a political party&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000141"></a>I am probing whether including basic information about local political parties that put up candidates for the council, such as their contact details or names of officials, in material that is given to people about how to get on the council would contravene this section of that Act. The following subsection modifies that in great detail, and I am not clear at all whether it is covered or not by this prohibition. We must be absolutely clear that it is not. If it is, the local authority is prevented from giving sensible information to people who genuinely want to stand for the council. The most sensible thing you can do is to ask people whether they want to stand as an independent or for one of the registered political parties that fields candidates in this area. If they want to stand for the Labour Party&#151;I am told that there are still a few who do, daft though some of us may think it&#151;the local authority ought to be able to point them in the direction of the Labour Party, or any other political party, as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000034"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe whether the Government think that political parties are a part of the process, and whether the council should give real-world advice about how to get on it, not just how to get a nomination paper, get 10 signatures and hand it in. That would not do much good in most cases. Secondly, I am probing whether that would be allowed, given the prohibition in the Local Government Act 1985. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="09011947000169"></a>6 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09011947000035"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09011947000183"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I understand why the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has suggested the amendment. It is quite plain that a key element of local democracy is the hard work and time given up by local councillors. They are the real grassroots politicians. It is vital that members of the public should freely and easily be able to make representations to them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000036"></a>It also goes without saying that the vast majority of local councillors will be sponsored by political parties&#151;in all likelihood by one of the parties represented in this Committee. To that extent, I can see the case for the noble Lord wanting to provide contact information. If you can get in touch with the local party, you should be able to get your message across to your local representatives. It would not be the only route, but I understand the argument that this is another strand of getting the flow of communication between voters and elected representatives.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000037"></a>However, I am not convinced by the argument put forward by the noble Lord that this is a necessary or even desirable provision to have in statute. Apart from the arguments deployed elsewhere that this is not the sort of detailed instruction we wish to see being given to local authorities in primary legislation, there is a deeper point. The noble Lord has made his case for providing simply contact information for political parties, to which I shall return. I am concerned by the words, &#147;and other relevant information&#148;, in his amendment. Who will decide what is relevant? How widely could that phrase be interpreted? I fear that political parties from across the spectrum may use that provision, however much in good faith they think they are acting, to use public bodies to promote their own aims. Promoting their own ideas is the right of any and every party. It should not be the responsibility of the local authority. It would be better to keep that distinction absolutely clear and not to allow any blurring of those boundaries.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000038"></a>I cannot see the need for providing even bare contact details of political parties. I agree that the contact details of elected councillors should be available in order for people to get in touch with those who represent them. However, any political party worth its salt should be able to publicise its own contact details. If a party wishes to promote itself, it should use its own resources and efforts. I and other Members of the Committee have campaigned for our parties and we know that, if a party is sponsoring a candidate for election, as well as publicising its goals and ideas, it should have no difficulty doing the same with its contact details.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000039"></a>I fear too that this amendment could have the unfortunate, although I am sure wholly unintended, effect of disadvantaging independent councillors or

For those reasons, we on these Benches cannot support this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000040"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09011947000184"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I am disappointed to hear the response from the noble Baroness. My noble friend made it very clear that at this stage this is a probing amendment which raises an important point. We all share the wish to encourage people to become councillors. If an individual approaches the local authority and asks, &#147;How do I do it?&#148;, should the response simply be, as my noble friend said, to send them the nomination form and papers, let them go off to find 10 people to sign them and then send them in? That is what one needs to do to become a councillor. Or is it more helpful to recognise the reality in the vast majority of areas in this country? Most candidates are sponsored by the political parties and the reality is that on most councils most councillors belong to those political parties. There is nothing in this amendment to suggest that councils should promote any or all of the political parties. This is not about the promotion of the parties at all. It is simply to explain the reality that if a person wants to become elected in an area, they should at least consider going through a political party of their choice or understand the implications if they choose not to. It is a free choice.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000041"></a>The second part of the amendment raises an important point, which I come up against quite often, although not in this connection. How restricted does one have to be as a local authority in dealing with any matters that could be held to be party political? Certainly, I understood this amendment to be seeking clarification. It will be on record in <I>Hansard</I>. We may have to return to it. The position will be clear, whatever the Minister may say. Let me be clear&#151;I am sure that my noble friend does not need me to say this&#151;this is not about asking local authorities to promote political parties or to say to people, &#147;If you want to be a councillor in this area, you will have to join the Labour Party&#148;. It is simply for the local authority to say that most candidates will be sponsored by a political party. That is the reality. If a person wants to consider that, these are the contact details that we would ask each of the registered parties to supply. It is simply about relaying information. Of course, the political parties should do that, as I am sure they do, and will indeed seek candidates, but we are talking in this context about the role of the local authority as distinct from the political parties. Somebody who wants to respond to the local authority fulfilling this duty needs to know the reality of the situation. At this stage, local authorities need the reassurance that if they supply the contact details of their local political parties, they will not fall foul of this provision.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000042"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09011947000185"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, rightly pointed out that Clause 1(2) focuses on the council&#146;s role so that members of public are clear about what their elected representatives do and, should they be interested in taking the next step, how they might go about becoming a councillor and what support will be available to them should they be elected.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000043"></a>Amendment 8, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, takes this further by allowing councils to point citizens towards local political parties by providing the contact details and other relevant information. I reinforce what the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said, about relevant information. It was a point well made. I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is trying to plug what he perceives to be a gap in the information that members of the public will need to be given if they are to find out what councillors do and how to become one. The amendment would add an unnecessary level of prescriptive detail to the Bill. The Bill places councils under a duty to promote understanding of how to become a councillor. We expect this to include an explanation of the political party selection process as well as of the fact that people can stand as independents. In the region of 6 per cent of councillors do so.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000044"></a>In discharging this duty, some councils may wish to provide contact details for local political parties in a non-partisan way and in accordance with relevant legislation. We will set out in guidance that this is a route that some councils may wish to consider. I again reinforce what the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said; while Clause 1 places a duty on local authorities, let us not forget that there is an important role for the political parties in promoting democracy and encouraging local people to stand for office. It is open to all political parties to publicise their activities in an authority&#146;s area, the work of their members who serve on the council and how people may become members of that party.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000045"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, rightly pointed to Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1986, which prohibits publicity designed to affect public support for a political party. Local authorities are also required under that section to have regard to the provisions of the <I>Code of recommended practice on local authority publicity</I> before coming to any decision on publicity. As noble Lords will know, the code is commonly known as the publicity code. It was introduced in 1988 and last amended in 2001. It seeks among things to assist local authorities when making decisions about publicity to ensure that resources are not used to publish material that could be perceived as having a party-political purpose.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000046"></a>My department is consulting the local government sector and stakeholders on the future of the publicity code. The consultation seeks views on its effectiveness as an instrument for protecting public money while allowing councils to issue effective publicity to keep their communities informed of the services that they provide and encourage greater participation in local democracy. It would be premature to make changes to the rules relating to local authority publicity without considering carefully the responses received to our consultation exercise. The consultation was launched on 12 December; it is not yet clear in which direction the responses will send us. However, responses received will inform the guidance that the department issues to local authorities to support them in their new duty to promote democracy. The guidance will make direct reference to how the publicity code impacts on councils in their new role and will clarify what it does and does not prevent them doing. We will ensure that comments made by noble Lords during this debate are fully

The consultation ends on 12 March 2009. We hope that a wide range of people will contribute their views. It is usual for public consultations of this nature to generate more than 1,000 responses.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000047"></a>Given what I have outlined, I hope that the noble Lord will be more reassured and will understand where our proposals are coming from.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000048"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09011947000186"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I think I have the answer to my basic question, but I shall come to that in a minute.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000049"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, that the words &#147;and other relevant functions&#148; is vague and kite-flying. It was put in precisely to generate a probing debate, and she was quite right to pick it up.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000050"></a>This comes back to the role of the council in promoting candidates to itself in any way. That is something that I have always been uneasy about; to put a duty on an authority to go out and get certain kinds of people or minorities or achieve diversity is an awkward duty because you are asking the authority to determine its own composition when it is meant to be a democratic authority elected by the people. That is a tangential question, but it is part of the problem.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000051"></a>If councils and other public bodies are to spend quite a lot of resources of different sorts in getting more women, ethnic minorities, young people&#151;more Welsh people in Wales, perhaps, or more English people in Wales, or whatever the underrepresented minority is in a particular part of Wales&#151;they are inevitably going to get involved in a political question. Some of those groups of people will be oriented more to some political parties than to others. The whole area causes me some unease. If it is going to happen, we need to be clear about it.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000052"></a>The Bill says that the council has to tell people who might want to be members what members of the principal local authority do. I can tell them what they do a lot of the time. They go to political party group meetings and take part in the local political party as part of their involvement in the community. That is what they do. If you say to people that they can be councillors on a council with three political parties, that there is not much chance of anyone else getting elected in the near future and that if they want to be councillors but do not want to go to local ward meetings or party meetings, take part in party campaigns in the area or go to the party group meetings, when they go to council meetings, unless they are very brave and have very strong views on things, they will very often vote how they are told to vote by their political party. In a more democratic party such as ours, of course, people go to the meetings where it is decided how to vote and take part in that process, then vote voluntarily with the majority. However, it works, they are working within a political context, which is what people will have to be told.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000053"></a>People who want to be councillors could also be told that, while they might be elected as an independent, with a lot of work and a lot of effort, if they were they would be on a council where everything was run through the political parties. They would not be part

That is the truth; it is the real world, and there is no point in not telling people about the real world.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000054"></a>The provision says that people must be told what support is available. If the political groups and parties are any use they will be a source of great support to the councillor. If you are not a member of a political party, you would not have that support and resource. Particularly if it was a big council, you would be on your own, in the wilderness. You might have the strength of personality to make some impact, but it would be much more difficult than if you are a member of a political party, unless you joined a dreadful, highly authoritarian political party and were just treated as muck as a Back Bencher, told what to do and not given any influence at all. That exists in all parties. It is the real world.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000055"></a>My question was whether Section 2 of the 1985 Act applies to giving sensible advice on the role of political parties in a particular area. Is that banned? I think that the answer from the Minister was that it is not banned. If that is a sensible thing to do in that area, within the reasonable limits of providing factual information, it would be possible. Both Ministers are nodding their heads; I shall put that on the record. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Through these amendments I seek to specify that the duty in Clause 1(1) to promote an understanding of an authority&#146;s functions, its democratic arrangements and how members of the public can take part in them, includes a duty to provide that information in formats accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000057"></a>Through these amendments, I am seeking to address a major democratic deficit in British society. No one can be in any doubt that we live in the information society today, if by that we mean an age in which we are bombarded by information from all sides as never before. The ability to handle this information effectively is critical to being able to participate effectively in society, avail oneself of its opportunities, fulfil one&#146;s responsibilities and negotiate one&#146;s way around the various institutions of society and the services it offers. Yet, for blind and partially sighted people, or those who are print handicapped in any way, the ability to do that is largely denied by the fact that the great bulk of that information is completely inaccessible to them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000058"></a>Article 21 of the recently adopted UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, on freedom of expression, opinion and access to information, says  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that state parties should provide information intended for the general public to persons with disabilities in accessible formats and technologies appropriate to different kinds of disabilities, in a timely manner and without additional cost. Yet, in health services alone, a recent survey of blind and partially sighted people in the UK showed that 95 per cent of respondents had never received health advice leaflets or information from their local surgery in their preferred format; 96 per cent had never received letters from their GP, results of tests or other correspondence in their preferred format; 95 per cent had never received medicines labelled in large print; and the NHS is apparently unable to send out appointments in an accessible format.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000059"></a>The Benefits Agency sends out benefit letters to blind people in standard print. A DWP survey of public bodies, including government, education, health and emergency services, found that only one quarter of all organisations offered information in large-print sizes; 8 per cent offered it on disc or CD; and as few as 4 per cent advertised the availability of Braille or audio. Although some of these materials were available on request, the survey found that approximately 40 per cent of bodies surveyed did not provide information in an accessible format at all. Even this Bill, an important piece of legislation, is printed in an inaccessible format&#151;a nice irony. It may be said that it is available on the internet, which is definitely something, but it should not be supposed that that makes it problem free.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000060"></a>Coming right to the areas with which the Bill is concerned, RNIB&#151;I declare my interest as its chair&#151;through its &#147;Information is Power&#148; campaign has identified several areas of local authority responsibility, from council tax bills to community newsletters to recycling and refuse collection times, that remain out of the reach of persons with disabilities on account of their inaccessibility, despite the requirements of the disability equality duty to make sure that services take account of the needs of disabled people. I recently heard a story of a local authority that stated that it was not possible to produce a council tax bill and explanatory booklet in large print, despite the fact that telephone and utility companies have been producing accessible bills for years. Not unreasonably, the taxpayer refused to pay a bill he could not read. He subsequently received two red letters and a court summons from the council, again all inaccessible, but no accessible bill.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000061"></a>The fundamentals of a democratic and participative society require us all to be active citizens. No group of people is more anxious to play its full part, collectively and as individuals, than the disabled. The Bill aims to promote democracy, encourage civic engagement and improve understanding of the role and functions of local authorities. My amendments ensure that it does that effectively for blind, partially sighted and other disabled people. The Government have been instrumental in pushing for more equal treatment of disabled people and in attempting to identify ways in which they can be more involved in decision-making. Yet there is still a dramatic deficit in the engagement and interaction of disabled people with local government structures. Information is power, but only if it can be accessed and understood. Thousands of disabled people across the country are excluded from society, their local authorities and democracy by the simple fact that  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information and documents are produced in formats that they cannot read. At one time, it might have been thought unreasonable to demand that information be produced in a form in which a blind person could read it, but in the 21st century, making documents accessible is not rocket science.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000062"></a>The importance of local government for all our lives should not be underestimated. Local authorities are in the front line of service provision. They are responsible for the provision of decent schools, better roads, leisure facilities, the emergency services, waste management and recycling, and they administer council tax. Disabled people arguably have more contact with local authorities through social services than their non-disabled peers. We all bemoan the growth of apathy in our society. The purpose of these amendments is simple. They ensure that public bodies have to take active steps to ensure that the 2 million blind and partially sighted people who live in the UK are able to participate effectively in public life. They also provide a powerful tool to enable local government to empower individuals to have a say in the running of their communities and the delivery of services and create opportunities for disabled people to become active and included members of civil society. The new clause in Amendment 73, which probably ought to apply to connected as well as principal authorities, provides a light-touch method of monitoring how far authorities are complying with the duty I am seeking to have inserted in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000063"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011947000189"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Low. He has worked tirelessly in this area, and I agree that if the Government are going to insist on this duty, information ought to be available in formats accessible to disabled people. I am sure that the Minister can assure us that this practice will be followed by local authorities across the country.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000064"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09011947000190"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> I, too, wish to support the amendments, not only because I agree with them in principle, but because the person who, many years ago, signed me up to a political party on my doorstep was herself partially sighted. When we were both elected to the local authority, we spent a lot of time trying to ensure that partially sighted people got the access to which we believed they were entitled and the kinds of things about which the noble Lord, Lord Low, has been speaking. We did not have to persuade very hard. We were Liberal Democrats, but although we were not running the council&#151;it was a Labour-controlled authority&#151;all the councillors were very co-operative in providing all sorts of assistance to enable my friend to deal with council agendas. We were all aware of the script that partially sighted people need if they are to read things. Council agendas were produced in large type so that my friend could deal with them. That takes me back to my early days on the council, in 1984, when we dealt with those matters.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000065"></a>Some councils have done that, but the noble Lord is quite right to say that people do not think about it. Very often, when one explains the situation to people, they are very happy to do it, as the council in Southampton  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC90"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was, but no one had thought about it. One of the reasons we managed to get ourselves elected was because we were campaigning as Liberal Democrats and we produced such things as <I>F</I><I>ocus</I> newsletters. My friend produced a talking version of the <I>F</I><I>ocus</I> newsletter in our ward.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000066"></a>I am very happy to support the noble Lord, Lord Low. I am sorry that in 2009 we are still dealing with this, considering we first tried to deal with it in 1984.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000067"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09011947000191"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I fully concur with the spirit of the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low. As always, he puts his case very powerfully.<b></b>A fundamental principle behind the duty to promote democracy is to ensure that information is made available to those who seek it and promoted to sections of the community who are less engaged and under represented in the democratic process. We know that disabled people are under represented and it is important to address that deficit.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000068"></a>Amendments 9 and 30 seek to include a specific reference in the provision of accessible information to disabled people. The noble Lord has already raised the issue and although he is not as satisfied as he could be, he will be well aware that the Disability Discrimination Act already requires public authorities, including local authorities, to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people when providing services and delivering their functions. These duties include the requirement to provide &#147;auxiliary aids and services&#148;; for example, information in accessible formats, where it is reasonable to do so, such as Braille, large print or audio tape.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000069"></a>The expectation of this duty is that local authorities will, through their promotional work, target all local people, with an extra focus on under-represented and/or hard-to-reach groups such as disabled people. To strengthen this focus, we will be specifying this in the guidance, as well as explaining how the duties fit with other equality duties. Part of this promotional activity will necessitate that arrangements and information are made available in a form that best meets the requirements of a particular individual or group.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000070"></a>The amendments require that disabled persons are referred to in the legislation. Of course, disabled people are only one of a number of under-represented or hard-to-reach groups as regards local democratic arrangements. The Government believe that it would not be practical or helpful to list what they believe to be under-represented groups. This may vary from area to area or service provision to service provision. For example, a minority ethnic group may be under-represented in one local area but not in another. We would expect local services specifically for disabled people to have good involvement from that group in its decision-making processes. The Government believe that local authorities are best placed to understand the nature and circumstances of their community and the needs of local people.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000071"></a>The duty is currently drafted to require local authorities to provide information to local people. &#147;Local people&#148; are defined as people who live, work or study in the area. This means all such people including disabled people.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000072"></a>The statutory guidance which will support the Bill, to which local authorities must under Clause 6 have regard, ensures that the provision of information to hard-to-reach groups including disabled people is addressed. The guidance will be explicit in that there is an expectation on local authorities to make arrangements and provide information in a way that best meets the needs of specific groups; for example, the hearing impaired and people with learning disabilities. The noble Lord raises a crucial point. We would be happy to have his direct involvement, his experience and expertise in the drafting of the guidance for this area, as well as the expertise of key stakeholders with whom we will consult.</p>
<h5><a name="09011947000171"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000073"></a>Amendment 73 will require local authorities to produce annual reports on the information which has been made public or available, but which was not made available in alternative formats. I understand that the noble Lord sees this as a discipline on local authorities, but our reading is that it would impose an unnecessary bureaucratic process and therefore an additional burden on local authorities without necessarily making more information more accessible to disabled people in alternative formats.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000074"></a>We have to trust local authorities and their track record. In practice, they will proactively make alternative formats available and alternative arrangements for access as a matter of course. It is important that any alternative arrangements are proportionate and reasonable. Therefore, the Government believe that local authorities are best placed to determine what is appropriate for local circumstances and what arrangements will best meet their objectives. The Disability Discrimination Act recognises that there is a balance to be struck between the requirements of disabled people and the interests of the service provider. Therefore, service providers are required only to make adjustments that are reasonable given all the circumstances.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000075"></a>I hope that the noble Lord is more reassured that our intention is that the guidance will ensure that disabled people, along with other hard-to-reach groups, are equally and properly served by this new legislation. I hope therefore that he is willing to withdraw his amendment and to take up the offer, alongside others, to be involved with the guidance on this area.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000076"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09011947000192"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply and to the noble Baronesses who have spoken in support of the amendment. I am more than a little reassured by the Minister&#146;s response. His reference to the department&#146;s intention to produce guidance to support the duty under subsection (1)&#151;that is, to provide information to the public generally&#151;is important and welcome. I would be very happy to be involved with the department in developing that guidance.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000077"></a>I also agree that it is probably not a good idea to spell out in legislation all the groups who might be covered by the duty to provide information. I recognise that, although I referred principally to blind and partially sighted people whose needs I know best, there are other groups, such as those with hearing impairments or learning difficulties, to which the Minister has rightly referred, to whose needs we need to pay attention.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000078"></a>Welcome as all of that is, I would have liked the Minister to go further. I thought that he would refer to the Disability Discrimination Act and the duty to make reasonable adjustments. The problem is that that legislation has been in place for some time, but there is still the democratic deficit to which I referred in moving the amendment. The legislation is in place, but it by no means does all that it was intended to do in this area. We need to do more to encourage it to have the effect that it was always intended to have.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000079"></a>The guidance on which the Minister has rested his case principally will certainly go some way, but I am inclined still to feel that it would help the guidance to bite if we had the duty, which I am seeking to insert, in the legislation. I will read carefully what the Minister has said and will reflect on it. Perhaps we could have a discussion before Report in the hope of reaching a form of words with which everyone is happy.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000083"></a>This is a long-standing minor grudge of mine that the Minister will remember from the passage of the Planning Act. The Government have an insistence on grouping counties and districts together, with the word &#147;or&#148;, when it is really a list of this &#147;and&#148; that, all being principal councils. However, I discover that in Clause 10(3) of the Bill there is another list of councils and types of council which says,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011947000157"></a>&#147;(a) a county council in England;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09011947000158"></a>(b) a district council in England&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09011947000143"></a>with the implication of &#147;and&#148; throughout the list. All I am asking for is some consistency. Of course, the Government may change Clause 10(3) to what I do not want to see, but I would rather that they changed this one, subject to the amendment, to what I do want to see. Whichever it is, they ought to do the same thing in different parts of the same Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I am sure that, as we debate the substance of what the districts and counties do, we will go into the important relativities between them.

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000086"></a>I was going to say that this is simply standard drafting. Members of the Committee will understand that this argument has been cut away by this reference in Clause 10, which I must confess that I had not spotted. In the light of this, I ask the noble Lord what difference it will make if we separate them out. Does he think that something substantial will follow? However, I take the point that we need to be consistent within the Bill, and I shall harass our officials to come up with an explanation of why they cannot be the same. I shall discuss this with the noble Lord before Report. I would, however, like an answer to my question about why he thinks it would make a difference.</p>

Legislation should say what it means. The word &#147;or&#148; is inappropriate here because, as the Minister said, it is both county and district councils. &#147;Or&#148; does not mean &#147;and&#148;; &#147;or&#148; means &#147;one or the other&#148;; &#147;and&#148; means &#147;both&#148;. The implication of a list with neither &#147;all&#148; nor &#147;and&#148; in it is that it is all &#147;and&#148;. I hope that I have not dug a hole I shall fall into on Clause 10(3).</p>

I notice the reference to Wales in the alternative. I am not quite sure why that is so. Consistency with the excellent point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would suggest that perhaps in this clause, subsection (3)(d) would be better separated out&#151;and the same applies in Clause 10, which has the same wording,</p>

<p><a name="09011947000093"></a>I hope that I have explained how they feel about this, and I hope that the Government can understand that perhaps they do not have the emphasis quite right on where the GLA should be.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000094"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09011947000203"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I am interested to hear why the Greater London Authority is to be treated as a connected authority for the purposes of this Bill, rather than a principal authority. The GLA has a very large direct electoral mandate; it has a very large budget and a great deal of influence on how London does its day-to-day business. It has responsibility for the strategic administration of greater London, which it carries out through the work of four bodies&#151;Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the London Fire Authority and the London Development Agency&#151;which might in the terminology of this Bill be described as connected authorities. All this would suggest that the GLA is much better placed in the principal authority&#146;s category.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000095"></a>The GLA is not an agency of the London boroughs, or a remote quango. It shares local government powers with the boroughs; indeed, it was created to improve co-ordination between those boroughs. It seems odd to describe it in this context as a mere connected authority. Why does the Minister think that the GLA lacks the wherewithal to fulfil the duty to promote understanding of democracy yet that the borough councils are better placed on its behalf?</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000096"></a>The noble Baroness has probed the meaning of local people quite extensively with these amendments. I agree that it is curious to have made the definition as it is made in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000097"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09011947000204"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for moving the amendment. With Amendment 12, noble Lords are trying to address what they perceive to be an omission from the list of bodies to which the duties to promote democracy apply. I understand the intent, and I certainly echo what the noble Baroness said about the experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and their understanding of the assembly and how it responds to its constituency. I am sure that they have seen that it might have a lot to say about democracy and how public input into its decision-making could benefit us all.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000098"></a>Let me explain clearly why the Government have explicitly excluded the GLA from the duty to promote democracy in Clause 1. The duty is primarily aimed at encouraging greater understanding of the opportunities that exist for members of the public to get involved in, and influence, the work of local public bodies. The GLA, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said, is a strategic body. It is important, on these grounds, that Londoners understand the democratic arrangements for the GLA and how they can engage with the work of the authority. City Hall has become central to the political life of London, with the Mayor having a national profile and considerable influence over the strategic direction of the capital and the assembly having a vital role to play in holding him to account on behalf of Londoners.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000099"></a>We have provided for that in a way that we think will be more effective, because the provision ensures that information about the GLA is provided to local people at the most appropriate level. Under Clause 2, London boroughs will be required to provide information on the GLA&#146;s functions and democratic arrangements, and we expect the GLA will be happy to provide the necessary information to all boroughs.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000100"></a>Amendment 40 is consequential on Amendment 12, but it has the unfortunate effect of releasing the London borough councils from a duty to promote understanding of how the GLA works, how it reaches decisions and what its functions are. That would leave a worrying information gap which would leave Londoners at a disadvantage compared with the rest of the country. The point is that we have placed a duty on the London boroughs because they are in the front line, and they could and should be the first port of call for local people who want to find out about local decision-making. The information they give should provide a comprehensive picture of the democratic landscape, and how the work of councils at different tiers fit together, and that would be impossible without featuring the GLA.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000101"></a>Although some people may still go to the GLA for information, we believe that most will go to their local council as the body nearest to their local community. The new duties will allow people to consider their local council as their local &#145;hub&#146; of information about how to participate in and influence democracy.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000102"></a>There is another complication. To have the GLA as a principal authority under Clause 1 would mean that it would be under the duty in Clause 2 to promote the functions and democratic arrangements of a wide range of local bodies in London. That would duplicate  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the work of boroughs which under this duty will be doing the same and would be complicated and confusing without necessarily enlightening or enabling the local community. I hope that I can persuade noble Lords of this and that they will agree that we should retain the GLA as a &#147;connected authority&#148; rather than a &#147;principal authority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000103"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011947000205"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> I thank for Minister for his explanation. I am afraid that he has not really convinced me and I am not sure whether he will convince my noble friends either. The people who can best explain how a local authority works are those people actually running it. Certainly, the GLA is important to London, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said. The various things that it does and the way that it operates are completely different. The role of the councillors is completely different. Therefore, you are expecting the London boroughs to be able to explain in detail how the GLA works, and I suspect that they may not be able to explain that as well as the people who actually sit on the GLA.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000104"></a>I hear what the Minister says and I recognise that there is a difficulty because the GLA does not fit the parameters of any other authority, but I believe that my noble friends have a good point. I have a feeling that they will read what the Minister has said and may return to this on Report. The Minister certainly has not convinced me and I have a sneaking suspicion that he will not have convinced my noble friends. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Why is it essential that Wales be included? Could the National Assembly for Wales and its Government not be given these responsibilities and be able to fulfil them more effectively in Cardiff than we do in this capital city? The Bill tries to involve more people and communities in their local affairs. To put Wales and its responsibilities in the Bill is a backwards step. The amendment gives the people of Wales full authority on the matters in this measure: devolution. If we accept these amendments&#151;I am sure that the Minister looks favourably on them&#151;it will be a step forward in the devolution process for Wales. Do we trust the National Assembly for Wales and its Government? Are we going to help them move forward? By withdrawing the references to Wales, we would be doing that. We would be trusting the National Assembly for Wales Government, which was set up by the Labour Government 10 years ago. Why not move forward a little more? England has enough problems of its own.</p>

I ask the Government to embrace these new opportunities not reluctantly, but wholeheartedly. I am certain that the Minister, with her Welsh background, will feel favourably inclined towards the amendment.</p>

Does he feel that, left alone, the National Assembly for Wales would, of its own volition, have taken some of the steps that could be initiated by the Bill? He may have point that there is a better place for the people of Wales to be as well served by legislation. It is government once removed if the initiative has to be taken here. However, we do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is no good simply deleting Wales and leaving it unencumbered by any responsibility to do the kind of things that the Bill requires. I am intrigued by what the Minister might say. In his reply, will the noble Lord indicate to us that he has in mind, or even knows, that there are moves afoot in Cardiff to do for the people of Wales precisely that which would have been done for them if Wales had been left in the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="09011947000109"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09011947000211"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Graham, does not seem to understand what devolution is all about. We may think that it is a good thing for the National Assembly for Wales or Welsh authorities to do this or that, but the principle of devolution is that it is for them to decide within those areas where, by and large, the National Assembly for Wales has competence. Local government is one of those areas. It does not have complete competence over local government in the way that the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government have over local government in Scotland, but it has substantial competence over local government. When Bills go through the Westminster Parliament, it is normal for the references to Wales to be permissive. Wales may be excluded completely, so that the Welsh Assembly makes the decisions. For example, we have the Planning Act, the Housing and Regeneration Act and a whole series of Acts under which Wales is graciously allowed to make its own decisions.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000110"></a>That is not happening here. In this legislation, it is being prescribed under Chapters 1 and 2 that Wales will have a system. The Bill says that it will apply in Wales unless the Welsh Ministers vary it. If they wish to vary it, they can, but they cannot not do it. We are not saying that the Bill should not apply to Wales, but that the powers of the Welsh Ministers and, therefore, the Welsh Assembly, should be completely permissive. In other words, the Bill says, &#147;This will happen in England&#148;. We are saying that it should say in relation to Wales, &#147;This may happen, and it may happen in this form or it may happen in a different form as agreed by the Welsh Minister and the Welsh Assembly&#148;. That is what is normally done nowadays in Wales. We do not understand why on these detailed provisions about the duty to provide this information and petitions, this Bill is different to what is now pretty well customary practice.</p>

He knows that I always do my best by Wales, which is why I am in complete agreement with everything that he said. But I assure him that the answer lies in what I am about to say.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000112"></a>The amendments seek to disapply the provisions of the Bill so that the duty will not apply to county or county borough councils or connected bodies, or to community councils, in Wales; to achieve this by changing the process so that Welsh Ministers can make subordinate legislation in respect of the duty and to modify those provisions as they see fit; and to ensure that the petition will be equally valid irrespective of language. These provisions would give Welsh Ministers greater flexibility to make different provisions in relation to promoting democracy and to petition schemes.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000113"></a>There is absolutely no difference in principle in recognising that, in Wales as much as in England, local communities should have a greater understanding of the role of local government and public bodies, and that there should be a requirement on local government to do that. My experience in Wales is that people are more involved in local government in many ways because it is nearer the ground.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000114"></a>Why have we done this in this way? The answer is that Welsh Ministers asked us to. They requested that these provisions are applied equally to England and Wales. We trust the Welsh Government. We listened to what the Ministers asked for and we have provided it. So my response is predictable: Welsh Ministers are content with the provisions set out in the Bill. They have not sought changes or further flexibility. That is partly because they also appreciate that we are leaving the detail and the process to local authorities themselves to determine what is best for their local communities and relationships. We were in very close contact with the Welsh Assembly Government throughout this process.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000115"></a>I know that the amendments are there to provoke debate. However, just in case they should pass into law by accident, I should say that agreeing, for example, Amendment 133A&#151;which would remove community councils from the list of bodies to which Welsh Ministers could by order provide that they had arrangements for handling petitions&#151;would be a serious blow to democracy in Wales. There are 736 community councils, which are equivalent to English parish councils, and only 22 unitary councils. The community councils are the bodies which are closest to the communities and identify with them. It would be totally unreasonable if this requirement were not to apply to them. A major concern is the serious risk that these amendments, if some but not all were approved, could lead to profound inequality between England and Wales. As my noble friend has asked, why should Wales be at any disadvantage to England in its citizens&#146; right to information about how councils work and how local people can be part of the process?</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000116"></a>There is a reason for the process as well, as Welsh Ministers were aware. These provisions can be commenced in Wales and England to the same broad timescale because they are included in the Bill. As noble Lords will know, the effect of the amendments would be that  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Welsh Ministers would have to wait for commencement before bringing forward subordinate legislation. I do not see why Wales should wait longer for this extension of democracy; nor do my colleagues, the Ministers in Wales.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000117"></a>On the amendment on petitions, I assure noble Lords that a petition, no matter whether it was written in English or Wales, would be treated in the same way. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, will know that all local authorities in Wales already have their own Welsh language schemes under the Welsh Language Act 1993 that give effect to the principle that Welsh and English are treated equally.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000118"></a>I suppose that we are debating here the devolution settlement in different ways and what powers the Welsh Assembly Government require to deliver for the people of Wales. Noble Lords will understand the passion with which I say that I do not believe that Westminster should in any way ignore or override what the Welsh Assembly Government require. We should not second-guess what those requirements should be. If Welsh Ministers want greater powers for themselves or the National Assembly, the Government of Wales Act enables them to request them. They have not considered it necessary in this case; they are content with the wording of the clauses and the flexibility which the order-making powers and their power to commence offer them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000119"></a>I draw the attention of the Committee to a technical procedure in relation to the petition provisions applying to Wales. Provisions relating to petitions are within the legislative competence of the National Assembly for Wales by virtue of Matter 12(5)(b) in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. Noble Lords will be aware that the agreement of the National Assembly should be obtained when a parliamentary Bill makes provision that falls within the legislative competence of the National Assembly. The National Assembly will tomorrow consider a Legislative Consent Motion and Memorandum to give consent on that point.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000120"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09011947000213"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Before my noble friend replies on the substantive matters, perhaps I may say how fascinated I was by what the Minister said about community councils, which are exactly what in England we call parish councils&#151;we might call them all sorts of other things now, although I have not discovered any that have changed their name yet. The Minister said that it was vital that community councils in Wales are given these responsibilities. Is she saying that that will apply in England as well by way of the provision which states that the Secretary of State may by order apply the provisions in Chapter 1 to parish councils? Is it the intention of the Government that this will be done?</p>

Why have they not done it in the past?&#148; A lot of things have not been done here that have been done in Wales, such as the Children's Commissioner and so forth. Why do we not trust the people of Wales? I do not think this matter has ever been discussed by the Assembly as a whole in Cardiff. I am not sure how far the consultations have gone or how the vote would have gone, if it had been put before a full sitting of the Welsh Assembly. Doubtless we will make mistakes, but we should be allowed to make them and allowed to plough our own furrow. We must forget that echo from the past.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000123"></a>Welsh culture is different. We speak about the Welsh language and what we should do piecemeal instead of placing it in the whole context of a Welsh language Act. We have to do that: it is not a case of putting in an amendment here or another word there. It is part of a whole cultural approach. Bearing that in mind, and there is a lot more one could say, I suggest that we should not forget this in its entirety. We will come to discuss things later on such as the way that we elect local councils. We have already discussed that in the Assembly. Scotland has already taken its own decision and implemented it. We in Wales would like to have the authority.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000126"></a>The issues relating to petitions are more important because a name or petition can be rejected if someone is not classified as a local person, whereas in Chapter 1, if information is being provided and promoted you cannot stop people receiving it. You cannot say that a person is not local and therefore cannot look at a website or whatever. It is more important later on. Nevertheless, the principle is first established here.

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000127"></a>My first approach to this would be to say that it is better not to try to define who local people are and leave that to common sense. As we have said several times this afternoon, central Government have put too much effort into trying to tie everything down. If it is to be defined in legislation, it needs to be sensible and it needs to have a clearer, more specific definition which, I would say, does not exclude people, or perhaps excludes people according to who needs to be excluded.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000128"></a>These amendments provide a series of options. No doubt, when the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, has analysed them with her legal mind, she will tell me that some of them are contradictory, which they are. This is a series of options to find a sensible definition of &#147;local people&#148;. The definition in the legislation is,</p>
<ul><a name="09011947000164"></a>&#147;&#145;local people&#146; ... means people who live, work or study in the authority&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011947000145"></a>That would make it exemplary and not definitive. In other words, I want to remove the word &#147;means&#148; and replace it with the word &#147;includes&#148;, which would mean that people are included, and not that others are not included. That would be perfectly reasonable.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000129"></a>A second logical way to do it, although not necessarily reasonable, would be to leave out the words &#147;work or study&#148; and just apply it to residents of the local authority area. There is a logical reason for saying that the residents in the area are people who apply specifically to that local authority. However, why should not the people who work in the local authority be included, particularly if they are entitled to stand for the council? People who study in the authority&#151;full-time students&#151;are perhaps a reasonable group of people to include. They might include people who go to school or who go to college over the border. In the next group of amendments but one we shall be discussing over-border issues. That widens the situation considerably, but it means that if you are a 17 year-old student who happens to cross a border to go to school, you are included, but if you live just the other side, you are not included, although you might be part of the same community and use lots of facilities provided by that council. It is not clear why the words &#147;or study&#148; are there. It also potentially includes part-time students, people who do just an hour&#146;s night-school class or whatever. I do not think it has been thought out very well.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000130"></a>Amendments 16 and 17 add property owners. To use the words &#147;people who own property&#148; is probably not exactly the right wording; it should be people who have an interest in a property. Why should you not have a right in relation to a local authority if you own property in that authority&#146;s area? You may well be a landlord who owns a dozen houses and have lots of dealings with the environmental health department or with the housing benefit department or whatever, or you might be someone who has interesting relationships with the local planning authority and you are trying to get planning permission for something. Why should you be excluded? If you are a property owner or a tenant, you have a right to stand for the local authority, so you already have a statutory right.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000132"></a>Amendment 18 adds,</p>
<ul><a name="09011947000165"></a>&#147;or use facilities provided by the authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09011947000146"></a>Many councils provide all kinds of facilities such as schools, leisure facilities, parks, subsidised bus services or whatever which are used by people who do not live in the authority but who have a perfectly reasonable interest in what the authority does, in making their own representations and in taking part in the local democracy of the authority which makes the decisions. Those of us who are members of local authorities get petitions from people who do not live in the authority because what we are doing affects what they are doing and their lives.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000133"></a>Amendment 19 points out that the franchise is different from what the Government are proposing and that there are people who are entitled to stand for the authority who do not come within their categories. They surely have a right to make representations and take part in democratic debate in the authority. Indeed, there are people who are entitled to stand for the council who do not come within the category that the Government are putting forward.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000134"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to suggest that the Government should be as general and inclusive as possible and should reject my detailed amendments that suggest additional categories in favour of removing all categories. They should simply say &#147;local people&#148; and leave it to common sense.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000135"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09011947000218"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has probed the meaning of &#147;local people&#148; quite extensively with these amendments. I agree that the definition is curious. It is restrictive but nebulous. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right to question how we define &#147;live&#148;. How much of the year must a person spend in his home to qualify? Is it six months and a day or all the year round? What about owners of second homes? I am sure many Members of the Committee will have something to say about how they would be defined because of where they live most of the week. What about people who own property but do not live in it for whatever reason? Are they included or excluded?</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09011947000136"></a>The noble Lord made other suggestions about people whose connection with an authority is just as substantial as those who are covered in the Bill. It seems that anyone with a connection to the services provided by a local authority could be said to have a sufficient local connection to warrant inclusion. A person who studies occasionally in a local authority&#146;s area may have less interest in the working and functions of that authority than someone who regularly uses the service that the authority provides, even though he may live elsewhere. It could be argued that someone who chooses not to participate in the life and prosperity of a local authority does not need to have the local authority dutifully promoting itself to them. These are not arguments that I wish to pursue to a ridiculous degree because the Government could get themselves out of the tangle of definitions of who must be considered as a local person simply by removing the duty.</p>

However, I cannot agree with one general point he made. He would alter the word &#147;means&#148; to &#147;includes&#148;. As this arises out of a duty on the local authority to promote understanding, and the Government intend that to be a serious duty, the local authority must want a clear definition of to whom the duty is owed. To have it at large would leave a great deal of undesirable uncertainty. The noble Lord has made a case for examining closely, and perhaps altering, the definition, but I agree that there should be a definition.</p>

<p><a name="09011947000138"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09011947000220"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for contributing to this debate. It is important that we understand the reasons for this definition as opposed to any of the other definitions suggested by the amendments or in debate. I shall explain the intention behind the existing definition of local people and the care that has gone into drawing it up.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000001"></a>Members of the Committee know that we are looking to require local authorities to help local communities to understand more about democratic processes, and so on. That includes all parts of the community&#151;young people and old, those who are working and studying and those not in work, people with disabilities and all ethnic and faith communities. As I have said several times already this afternoon, this is about invigorating local democracy and the control that people feel they can exercise over everything from the quality of care for older people to their councils taking action to mitigate climate change. We have to balance that, as it is a large ambition, to ensure that we are fair to and with local authorities as well. We do not want to create a duty that is overly burdensome to local authorities&#151;and noble Lords would certainly try to stop us doing that. We also want to establish a clear and understandable definition, and we believe that these terms, &#147;live&#148;, &#147;work&#148; and &#147;study&#148;, in their normal understanding, do that for us.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000002"></a>One reason why we cannot just say &#147;local people&#148; is, because, without a definition, as my noble friend Lord Borrie said, it would be very unclear who was included. It would make it very difficult for local authorities to know whether they had complied with the duty. Clearly, that is going to be extremely important. Consistent with the overarching approach that we are taking to trust local authorities to interpret this in a way that makes sense and in the spirit of the duties they owe to the communities, we have arrived at this definition. But it is also important that we provide such help as we can through guidance that will identify the nature of those groups of people whom local authorities should seek to reach. We will also suggest some methods to provide the relevant information to the local people.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000003"></a>On Amendment 14, I appreciate how the noble Lord has wrestled with this issue. It is complicated and it is important that we get it as right as we can. Amendment 14, by using the word &#147;includes&#148;, potentially broadens the group of people to whom the principal local authority is to promote understanding. The noble  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord argued that if there is going to be such a duty, it should reach the widest number.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000004"></a>Amendments 15 to 19 seek to alter the definition from &#147;live&#148;, &#147;work&#148; and &#147;study&#148; to one that is cumbersome and wordy, and includes people who live or own property or use facilities provided by the authority,</p>
<ul><a name="09011950000024"></a>&#147;or who are otherwise entitled to be registered as a local government elector for the authority or who are qualified to be a member of the authority&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000005"></a>In choosing that wording, the noble Lord has abandoned any interest in people who work or study in the area. In so far as we are trying to provide an opportunity for young people who are engaged in education at all levels, we thought it important to include that opportunity, because they are young people who will be directly and intimately affected by any changes in the education system and who would want to get involved in any improvements. That would include any university students.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000006"></a>We also think that the terms that the noble Lord has come up with are extremely burdensome. With the term &#147;use facilities&#148; in Amendment 18, where does it end? Where are the boundaries here? Is it reasonable to try to impose a duty on local authorities to promote democracy for people who happen to be walking down one of the local streets, using the facilities? You could interpret it as broadly as that. Should Westminster City Council have a legal duty to promote democracy to the thousands of foreign visitors who happen to pass through the area during the course of a year? Should an authority be under a legal obligation to respond to petitions raised by transit passengers through an airport located in their area? Obviously, we would like to see Westminster doing all those things, but we are not persuaded that it is reasonable to impose legal obligations on it to do so.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000007"></a>On the second definition, &#147;owning property&#148;, our definition will capture the huge majority of people who own property and live in the area. The addition in the amendment puts an unnecessary burden on local authorities to promote democracy to people who do not live in the area but who may own property. That raises some major issues about how that could be exercised. Again, it is an unnecessary burden to place on local authorities.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000008"></a>We are looking, for example, at people who do not technically reside in the area. They could be absentee landlords or people with second homes. Do we want those people to understand the benefits of democracy? Of course we do. However, to bring that within the existing definition effectively is an onerous burden. We considered all sorts of formulations. We have not just thrown this together at the drop of a hat. We considered the term, &#147;on the electoral register&#148;, but that excluded too many people: the young, the homeless and the recently arrived. We considered the term &#147;use services&#148;; that was too broad.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000009"></a>The one thing that &#147;live, work or study&#148; has to commend it is that, in each case, there is an address that an authority can be sure either is or is not within the area. It provides a full scope for people who have a genuine interest and are genuinely affected by the services there. Linking to an address is also a clear criterion. It would be pointless and extremely expensive otherwise to pin down exactly who is to be included in  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this sort of definition. We do not want council officers to have to be engaged in the exercise of tracking down every last person. We want to give them, as simply as possible, an indication of the categories of people that they should be aiming their activities at. That is what we have done. With the best will in the world, the amendments are not a substantive improvement on that.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000010"></a>We would clearly want to offer additional help in the guidance to ensure that everybody had a clear understanding of what we meant. We would certainly be consulting on that. That would include suggestions of how local authorities could provide the relevant information across the whole range of media now available to them.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000011"></a>We have tried hard to deliver the intent of the clauses in this definition. I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s effort and how he has opened up the debate. I am sorry that I cannot accept his amendments; I genuinely think we have something that is about as robust and useful to local authorities as it could be.</p>

<p><a name="09011950000012"></a><b><a name="90119-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09011950000025"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> That was all very interesting and, I am afraid, confirms in me my view that this is all a shambles. It is not robust and clear at all. I want to find some polite words that I can use in this Committee. The Government are running amok in a field full of cows and do not quite know where to go.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000013"></a>I was grateful for the partial support of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, but he really ought to stop standing up and saying that he is surprised to agree with me. He will find that we agree with each other on a large number of things. We should not be surprised, and should recognise when we disagree that that is okay.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000014"></a>When I listen to the Minister on what the councils will do, practically, to carry out this duty, I find myself wondering what it is. I think that they will print some leaflets and have them available in appropriate places. Appropriate places would be town halls, libraries and leisure centres, and then they could send them out to community centres and things like that. However, a lot of the people who will pick up leaflets in those areas will not fit into the Minister&#146;s categories. They will be people who have gone to the swimming pool because it is a good one, but they live in the next borough. Or they will be people who go to the library but do not actually live in the area. Perhaps they will be second-home owners who only live there part of the time. They might be on the electoral register. The Minister says that her categories are clear, but the question of who lives in an area is far from clear for people with two or more homes.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000015"></a>This is not clear at all, and targeting leaflets in sensible places will reach people who are not in the Minister&#146;s categories automatically and rightly. The Minister said that people have addresses and that a leaflet may be distributed or that the information might go in one of the free council newspapers that are churned out. That is fair enough, but they go door to door. They are not targeted at people who live there; they are targeted at the addresses that exist there at any given time.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000016"></a>The Minister said that there will be an address for all these people. There will not be an address for students. Will the council get their addresses from  


<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC106"></a><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column GC106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>educational institutions and mail them out to them wherever they live? There will be addresses for workers perhaps. I cannot think that the council will contact all the employers and everybody who has a shop in an area but does not live there, and find out where they live in order to mail them out. I do not see that that is practical. One cannot target those groups in the clear, specific way that the Minister is talking about.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000017"></a>There will be a website. The obvious place to put information about who does what and how to get involved, which is what we are talking about, is the website, but that targets people with access to computers; it does not target people who happen to live, work or study there&#151;although the people who study are more likely to look at computers than a lot of the people who live there.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000018"></a>The Minister&#146;s arguments do not stack up. I am in favour of targeting institutions or places where people go for information such as this. One can have displays and people can pick the information up. Many of those institutions are the places or facilities that people go to because they are good, such as swimming pools, but those people do not necessarily live in the relevant local authority.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000019"></a>I understand that &#147;includes&#148; may not be a sensible word, but the Minister should abandon all attempts to define local people. Everybody knows who the local people are in a particular place. They belong to all the categories that we have been talking about and they do not necessarily live exactly within the boundary of the authority.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000020"></a>The idea that vast resources will be devoted to targeting everybody individually is nonsense; the resources will not exist. Councils will target sensible means of communication such as websites or local newspapers and sensible places where people might pick up the information. Otherwise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said, it would mean a totally unacceptable increase in the council&#146;s costs.</p>

<a name="90119-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09011950000021"></a>I am not in any way persuaded by what the Minister said, but I shall as always read it carefully. I do not know whether it is a sufficiently important issue to bring back at a later stage, but I ask the Government to think again about this. It does not matter too much in Chapter 1; but when we come to petitions, it will be crucial. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0901197000005"></a>Ministers discussed non-co-operative financial jurisdictions, the IMF's resources, and the setting up of an early warning system for financial risks at an international level. They also discussed taking forwards work at EU level in response to the action plan agreed by leaders at the Washington summit on 15 November.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0901197000006"></a>Ministers asked the Financial Stability Forum to identify jurisdictions believed to be acting non-co-operatively in the financial sector.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0901197000007"></a>They also committed to reviewing all options to enable the IMF to have adequate resources to continue playing a stabilising role in the financial system. In order to detect macroeconomic and financial risks within the global financial system, ECOFIN mandated its experts to identify means more effectively to evaluate the full extent of risks and strengthen collaboration between the IMF and the FSF.</p>

The sale has raised approximately &#163;4.42 billion for the NLF, which was set up at the time of BE&#146;s privatisation in 1996 to meet the eventual decommissioning costs of existing nuclear power stations. EDF will transfer this amount to NLF by Monday 19 January 2009.  Completion of the takeover was announced by EDF on Monday 5 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0901197000036"></a>I am today publishing the Ministry of Justice corporate plan for 2009-11. This, our first corporate plan, is the culmination of a huge amount of work to provide clarity on what the department, only 20 months old, will achieve over the remainder of the spending review period, how and with what resources.</p>

<a name="90119-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0901197000037"></a>The plan is based around our four strategic objectives and explains how we will:</p>
create a momentum of reform across the justice system with front-line staff working in partnership with local communities to bring about change;build on our good work involving communities in justice so we are more responsive to how the public want their justice system to develop;ensure justice is not only done, but is seen to be done; andensure that the voice of those who suffer most from the impact of crime&#151;victims&#151;is heard in all aspects of our work.

This widens the excellent service already provided for those who have lost their jobs through large-scale redundancies by extending the service into all companies affected by redundancies of 20 or more, or localities affected by the cumulative effect of multiple smaller redundancies.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="0901195000018"></a>We have also announced the next stage of help for jobseekers. We know that the majority of people move off jobseeker's allowance within six months, but we are guaranteeing more help for those who do not. First, we are enhancing the support offered by Jobcentre Plus advisers. This will mean more time spent between an adviser and an unemployed person reviewing their job search activities and seeing how they can apply more effectively for the vacancies available. Secondly, we will be making available an expanded range of work and training options that an adviser would be able to offer customers. These will be &#147;golden hellos&#148; of around &#163;2,500 for employers who recruit and train people unemployed for over six months; money and support to set up their own business; training to improve skills to get a job; and the chance to volunteer while looking for a job.

This will be supported by an additional investment of &#163;79 million from the Government's Train to Gain budget to help people access the training they need to get back into work as quickly as possible. The extra funding will help the Learning and Skills Council, with local colleges and training providers, to work closely with Jobcentre Plus to make sure those people affected by job losses get access to the services they need.</p>

Employment and support allowance is underpinned by the Pathways to Work programme, which is now available to everyone receiving incapacity benefits and employment and support allowance in Great Britain. Around &#163;1 billion is being invested in Pathways to Work between 2008 and 2011 to provide the support disabled people need to return to work.</p>
