<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, the UK Government are deeply concerned about the crisis in Darfur. As the second largest donor, we have already allocated &#163;62.5 million for humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis. In addition, the Department for International Development has provisionally allocated &#163;35 million for Sudan this financial year in anticipation of a comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan. The Chancellor yesterday announced &#163;150 million for the following three years for emergency and other relief.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for her Answer. Is she aware that conditions in the villages of Darfur are so poor and the food shortage is so great that some already malnourished children are forced to eat wild plants that are known to be toxic? Is she also aware that people are taking refuge in these villages, escaping from war and destruction, and that the villagers have to share their meagre supplies with them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right; the conditions in the villages merit a great deal of attention. Darfur has always been chronically poor. I am aware that host communities which are already poor are sharing resources with those internally displaced. That is why the humanitarian effort in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1124"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Darfur is so critical. There have been hold-ups with aid distribution, but it is gradually improving. In June the World Food Programme reached 500,000 people, although we estimate that 1.2 million people are in need.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, further to the Minister&#039;s reply, what steps have Her Majesty&#039;s Government taken to help farmers return to their villages? Can they provide figures for those who have managed to get back in time to plant this season&#039;s crop? What money do the Government plan to provide to help to alleviate the specific food crisis? Perhaps Her Majesty&#039;s Government could emulate the programme of the charity Kids for Kids by donating to families one donkey and harness to carry water and fodder, which cost only &#163;27 and has proved so successful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness may be aware that the rains have already started. That is one of the reasons that the aid programme in Darfur has been hampered. The focus is on getting food in to feed those in the villages and ensuring that the NGOs have proper access. We have worked very hard to persuade the Government of Sudan to ease some of the bureaucratic restrictions. I have met Kids for Kids; it does very good work in Sudan.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of UN reports that the Janjaweed militia, which has been supported by the Government of Sudan, continues to attack clearly marked humanitarian convoys, despite the escalation of the catastrophe, with possibly 300,000 more people dying in coming weeks? What steps are Her Majesty&#039;s Government taking to ensure that the Government of Sudan stop the militia&#039;s interference with the humanitarian effort and are themselves brought to account for complicity with the military offensives, which are the cause of the catastrophe?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, we regard the safety and security of humanitarian workers and the people in Darfur as paramount. I have been alerted to reports of continuing attacks. That remains a cause of serious concern. As the noble Baroness will be aware, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development, Hilary Benn, Colin Powell and Kofi Annan visited Sudan, as a result of which an agreement has been made with the Government of Sudan. We want to see that agreement implemented.

<a name="40713-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the rainy season has now started in Sudan&#151;

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew7"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   My Lords, she has said so.
</p>

</p>

<a name="40713-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>In that case, have the Government identified airstrips where food aid can be dropped? Is she aware also of trouble developing in other parts of Sudan, particularly Malakal? Are the Government concerned about that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I am aware that the rainy season has already started. We are investigating with the UN and the World Food Programme the best ways of distributing food in the light of that. I am aware of trouble in other parts of Sudan, including Malakal, and the need to get humanitarian assistance into those areas as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Eden of Winton: </b>   My Lords, further to the question asked by my noble friend Lady Cox, is it not clear that the Government of Sudan are, at the very least, closing an eye to what is taking place in Darfur, or, at the very worst, condoning it? Surely this atrocity has now reached a scale where the United Nations ought to exert every effort to call the Government of Sudan to account.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware that Kofi Annan was in Darfur recently. There has been a discussion on Darfur at the UN Security Council, to which Kofi Annan gave a video-link report on the situation in Sudan. The UN is taking the issue very seriously. The noble Lord will be aware that we were concerned at the lack of speed of the UN response in the early days, but that has improved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Whitaker: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend urge the Government to congratulate the African Union on sending to Darfur not only peace monitors but troops to protect them and the local population?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, of course I can. The African Union, at its recent summit, made a strong statement on the need for support in Sudan. We are supporting the ceasefire monitoring mission to the tune of some &#163;2 million.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, given that the Machakos peace accord relies on reconstruction of many parts of Sudan, including southern Sudan, which I visited, will the Minister confirm that the Question on the Order Paper, calling for aid to be switched from other parts of Sudan to Darfur, is not the Government&#039;s policy and that the overall amount of aid that will be given to Sudan will not change? Can she also say something about the exodus of people from Darfur into Chad and the perilous conditions that they are now in?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I can confirm that we will not switch aid from other parts of Sudan to Darfur. We have given some &#163;62.5 million for the humanitarian crisis in Darfur itself, with an additional &#163;35 million allocated for the rest of Sudan. Yesterday the Chancellor announced another &#163;150 million over three years.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether it is intended that the proposed new Commission on Human Rights will have a disabled commissioner and a disability committee on which half of the members will be disabled people.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40713-01_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Yes, my Lords. We published the White Paper <i>Fairness for All: A New Commission for Equality and Human Rights </i>on 12 May. In it we set out our proposals for distinctive governance arrangements for disability. These proposed arrangements include a statutory requirement for at least one disabled person (or a person who has had a disability) to be appointed to the board, and the establishment of a disability committee where disabled people (or those who have had a disability) represent at least half of its membership.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040713/text/40713-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. The White Paper has been warmly welcomed. But in view of the proposed developments in the White Paper and legislation and the Government&#039;s splendid and extensive programme for legislation on disability, can we have an assurance that provision will be made for specialised expert staff and special money for the disability committee? Can we have that assurance written into legislation for the new Commission on Equality and Human Rights?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the warm welcome that my noble friend has given the White Paper, not least because of his outstanding record in promoting the rights of disabled people. It would be unthinkable for the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) not to employ a good number of disability experts to support the committee&#039;s work. It will take forward the very energetic agenda that the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) has in mind. We certainly expect staff from the DRC to have the opportunity to transfer into the CEHR under the normal TUPE arrangements, and to maintain its excellent work.
</p>

<a name="40713-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>In response to the second point, we are fully committed to ensure that the CEHR is adequately resourced so that it can implement the programme. There would be little point in doing otherwise. However, I do not think that we want to constrain the board in any way as regards its internal arrangements. I hope that my noble friend will be satisfied with that reply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that noble Lords will agree on the vitally important role played by the Equal Opportunities Commission in promoting equal opportunities for women. In the light of that, do the Government believe that the proposed new combined commission can be anything like as <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

successful in carrying forward and sustaining the issues that still remain to be tackled in this field, not least in ensuring that all our public bodies promote equality of opportunity?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, already two distinguished Members of the House have set high standards indeed for the EOC. I am convinced that each strand of the equality work, including the EOC, will go forward and will be expanded in relation to new challenges, in particular in relation to the human rights element. We have a unique opportunity to address the public agenda and make sure that public authorities live up to those responsibilities. We also anticipate in the White Paper a new gender duty, which will oblige public bodies to ensure that their actions as employers and service providers will guarantee equality of opportunity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that if we are to have a committee to back up a commission, the committee will not only be drawn from disabled people, but from disabled people from a wide range of disability backgrounds? Although it may be easier for a person who, say, has a mobility problem to empathise with someone who has a similar one, first hand knowledge will be important. Hidden disabilities and movement problems must be represented across the board to ensure that this committee achieves its full potential.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, absolutely. The Disability Rights Commission, in its three or four years, has already established the width, breadth and scope of expert investment in the disability field. I particularly take the point made by the noble Lord in relation to learning disabilities, because I know that he is concerned about those. I am sure that those people will be well represented.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that provision will be made for all posts to be open to women and disabled people who may be unable to work full time? Will the disabled commissioner have a duty to represent the views of the disabled in the central body?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that if we can look to any organisation to have equal opportunities in their employment practices, it will certainly be the new commission. I can also confirm the noble Baroness&#039;s second point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   My Lords, the proposed disability committee will be subject to a mandatory review after five years. Can the Minister outline how such a review is likely to be conducted and with what level of parliamentary scrutiny? Can she also assure the House that disabled people and their organisations will be fully involved and listened to in the review?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Yes, my Lords, I can give an assurance on the last point. Parliamentary scrutiny <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will not least be part of the obligation to prepare an annual report and even a Select Committee inquiry. In terms of the five-year review, we do not have that degree of detail yet. I am sure that in the consultative process, which is not yet concluded, there will be attention to that sort of detail. I will write to the noble Baroness if there are aspects that I do not have a grip on.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   My Lords, we too welcome this move. To what extent do the Government envisage that a disability committee within the CEHR would be free to set its own strategy and develop its own policies with respect to disability issues? What powers would the committee possess?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the detail of the powers is to be worked out over the coming months as the new steering board makes the transitional arrangements for the development of the full board, which will not come into operation until the end of 2006. We have been concerned not to constrain or restrain any of the administrative detail. The disability committee, having inherited the work of the Disability Rights Commission, will be able to set its own remit. I am sure that it will want to follow along the lines that it has already started.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, will the commissioner be able to deal with a situation where the easy-read version for the learning disabled of the <i>Fairness for All</i> White Paper, which deals with equality, was produced only yesterday; some eight weeks after the standard version and almost two-thirds of the way through the 12-week consultation period? Is that the proper way to involve disabled people in matters that really concern them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40713-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   No, my Lords, it most certainly is not. I am sorry to hear of the length of time that it has taken to get that document out. It is rather a specialised document, but there is no excuse for that. I know that when the noble Lord chaired the Joint Scrutiny Committee, he was able to ensure that both versions of the document came out at the same time. We absolutely welcome responses from disabled people, particularly those with learning disabilities. The door is not shut on 6 August. Given the shorter period of consultation, I am absolutely sure that if they make a response it will be taken seriously.

Will the Government also consider encouraging the use of correction columns in newspapers, such as those in the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Mirror</i>, so that such Euro myths can be rebutted quickly and effectively at the time of publication?

<a name="40713-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the debate about the way in which the press covers a number of issues is one where the Government could look sorrowful and say how unfair things are in that respect; but that would not command a great deal of sympathy. What the Government must do in the circumstances is set out as clearly as possible why we believe that this treaty is a good treaty and deserves support. The point about analysing the treaty properly and indicating that many of the things that are complained about were in fact signed up to in the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty should be a salutary lesson for one and all.

<a name="40713-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is being uncharacteristically rather unfair about that. From this Dispatch Box, over and over again, I have never used the phrase to which he has referred&#151;not once. I have said throughout that there is much in the treaty that brings together the four&#151;or, indeed, five, if one includes the Treaty of Accession&#151;previous treaties. Indeed, there are new matters in this treaty; for example, the very important power being given to parliaments for the first time.
</p>

<a name="40713-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Much of what is being complained of is already in the treaties. Perhaps I may take the issue of fishing, about which I understand the party opposite is very exercised. The provisions in the treaty, for example, on fisheries bring forward the competencies first agreed by the noble Lord&#039;s party when it was in government and signed up to our accession. That is my point. Many of the difficulties made about this constitutional treaty arise from points that are already in treaties; but not exclusively. I have never said that from this Dispatch Box, and the noble Lord knows that.

<a name="40713-03_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we welcome the proposal to establish a European external action service to be set up following ratification of the constitutional treaty. The service would support the work of a new EU foreign Minister and would draw staff from the Commission and the Council secretariat as well as secondees from member states.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40713-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Can I encourage the Government to publish a brief Green Paper on how they see the European Union external action service developing? The <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i> are already talking about a taking-over of the British diplomatic service. A Green Paper might, for example, include reference to the useful sharing of facilities that we already have with the German Government and others and a recognition that when there are more than 190 states in the UN it is very difficult for us to have resident missions in all of them. Is a Green Paper a useful idea?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40713-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, it may be a very useful idea in due course. But if we produced Green Papers to refute every single inaccuracy published by the <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#151;which are not alone in publishing inaccuracies&#151;we should be littered with Green Papers all around Whitehall.
</p>

<a name="40713-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The way in which the external action service will be set up and operated will be discussed in detail after the 29 October signing of the treaty. Then of course there will be a great deal of interaction between the Commission and member states about the exact way in which the external action service should operate. But I think that the noble Lord&#039;s idea of a Green Paper is excellent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40713-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that some 15 years ago when I was still head of the Diplomatic Service I received a delegation of French parliamentarians? One of them asked me whether I thought that at the turn of the century there would still be an individual British diplomatic service. I replied that I was almost certain that there would be, but that I was totally certain that there would still be a French diplomatic service.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40713-03_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, indeed, I was not aware that the noble Lord had received a French delegation. I am very glad that he gave such a robust response. Of course, there is no suggestion that the external action service would replace national diplomatic representation because the draft treaty states:

<a name="40713-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that a European Union external action service may require the use of force? If that is so, would not its responsibilities overlap with those of the United Nations, NATO and, indeed, our own Armed Forces?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, no. I do not think that is true. The common foreign and security policy will proceed only on the basis of a unanimous vote. That was one of the red lines the Government set themselves in the drafting of the recent treaty. That has been clearly maintained. As the noble Lord may recall, the European security and defence policy (ESDP) similarly means that national governments will have to take decisions over any decision to use force.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, following the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, has the Minister received any expression of concern from Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff or the diplomatic corps about the dangers of overlap between the new external service and the existing national diplomatic services? Is there not some concern that as there is no common European foreign policy&#151;indeed, we disagree quite strongly with many of our neighbours on major and central foreign policy issues&#151;it will be very difficult for this new diplomatic service, which, in effect, is what it will be, to be effective and produce a combined view in areas where all the member states disagree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I have not received any representations of that nature. I am not suggesting to your Lordships that there will not be some concerns. I appreciate the point made by the noble Lord. It is important to ensure that there is not duplication of effort. There will be further discussion about how the European external action service will be established. I do not expect those discussions to start until at least the end of this year. I remind the noble Lord, as regards his worries in relation to the common foreign and security policy, that it was the Maastricht Treaty that introduced the concept of such a policy.

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we   share buildings only.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>What action they propose to take in response to the International Court of Justice ruling on 9  July on the legality of the wall being built by Israel in the West Bank.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we are considering the detail and implications of the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Israeli barrier. We have been consistent in recognising Israel&#039;s legitimate security concerns, but consistent, too, in believing that the barrier built on occupied territory is unlawful. We have made it clear to the Israeli Government that Israel must act within international law. We have also stressed to the Palestinian Authority its responsibilities for improving Palestinian security.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that encouraging reply. Does she note the advice from the court that the wall is not only illegal, but also jeopardises the two-state solution? Does she also note the judgment of the Israeli Supreme Court of 30 June, which ordered major changes to the route of the wall because it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;disproportionate . . . violates the rights of the Palestinians&quot;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>What urgent action are the Government taking on this issue and what action are they urging on their US and EU allies both in the UN and elsewhere?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, much as I appreciate the importance of the court ruling, it does not make any difference to the point that I was making at the beginning that we believe that it was an unlawful barrier in the first place. We have been making such representations for quite some time. I agree with the noble Baroness that the barrier may be said to jeopardise the two-state solution because it separates the West Bank into different cantons and therefore undercuts the possibility of a viable and contiguous&#151;that is an important word&#151;state of Israel. I also believe that the Supreme Court ruling is very important because it is about the humanitarian impact of the wall, which has been adjudicated on by the courts which have asked for 30 kilometres of the wall in east Jerusalem to be reconsidered. We are heavily engaged on this issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, in the event that this matter and the actions are illegal, would not an abstention at the United Nations on such matters be quite inappropriate?

deal with it at two levels. First, as the noble Lord will know, we did not believe that referral of this issue to the ICJ in the first place was appropriate because hitherto such referrals have concerned matters where both parties have consented to the referral. We believe that this referral has made it a much more politically-based issue. We are not alone in believing that. The whole of the EU thought so, as did Australia, Canada, New Zealand and a whole range of countries. They all made the same point. The question we must ask ourselves is what does any UN resolution say and will it be in the appropriate context of looking at the very important question of security as well as the legal and humanitarian impact of the security barrier.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew11"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   My Lords, is it not true that all the faffing about whether it is legal or not does not make a ha&#039;porth of difference? When the United States says &quot;Do it&quot;, they will do it, and when it says &quot;Don&#039;t do it&quot;, they won&#039;t. Until the United States puts its effective power behind the peace settlement in the Middle East nothing will happen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, no. That is far too nihilistic a view of what is going on. It is a very complicated position. As I have already said, we believed that this barrier was not legal before the ruling. But it is important to look at why the barrier is being built in terms of Israel&#039;s legitimate security concerns. They cannot be swept on one side; they are real. The fact is that the Israeli Government have produced figures, which I grant are their own, which show how many fewer deaths from terrorism there have been since the wall was erected. That does not make it legal. It is still unlawful. But there is a legitimate issue about security and one issue cannot be addressed without the other. It is enormously important. We will lose any legitimacy that we have with both sides in the argument if we choose entirely to ignore the points of one side about their own security and the possibility of terrorism jeopardising their people.

<a name="40713-04_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Turnberg: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend agree that, while the Palestinians are still setting up terrorist training camps for youngsters, as reported by Sky television recently, it would be unrealistic to expect the Israeli Government not to make every effort to defend their citizens? Is it not also the case that many governments, including that of the United Kingdom, made it clear that at a time when Israel is taking the first steps to implement the road map by withdrawing from Gaza, the wall is not something on which the international court should be spending its time?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40713-04_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I take issue with my noble friend on one point. It is not Palestinians who are setting up the training camps but extremists. I would be very sorry to see your Lordships falling into the error, of which I have heard quite a lot in the United States, of deciding that all Palestinians are terrorists. That is self-evidently not true. There are many law-abiding Palestinians who long for peace as <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much as anything else. The point is that the British Government have been discussing with the Palestinians ways in which we can help with their security. They are discussing the same issues with the Egyptians at the moment. I hope that ICJ rulings and incidents which we have to deal with throughout the peace do not detract from the overall position that one must listen to both sides of this long, complex and horrible problem in order to try to make progress. I believe that that is possible through the road map.

<a name="40713-05_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, is it not the case that it is 24 hours since the Minister was speaking about the importance of compliance with United Nations resolutions? Is it not also the case that while we absolutely recognise Israel&#039;s proper concern about security, that must be held within some kind of international consensus? For instance, there is the fact that the right of a nation to defend itself does not include the right to build defence installations on territory which it has not been agreed to be theirs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40713-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, indeed. It is unlawful for the barrier to be built where it is. It is unlawful to have settlements in the occupied territories. These points have been reiterated again and again from this Dispatch Box. The difference between the resolutions which we were discussing yesterday and those as regards Israel&#039;s obligations are twofold. First, the resolutions that we discussed yesterday were mandatory under Chapter 7. Secondly, almost all the resolutions which refer to Israel&#039;s obligations also refer to Palestinian obligations. The fact is that neither side has fulfilled its obligations under UN resolutions.

<a name="40713-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   My Lords, before the House agrees to the Motion, perhaps I may say a few words about the work of the Select Committee to which the House committed this Bill on 8 March and which I had the honour of chairing. Noble Lords may recall that the Select Committee procedure is used very rarely in respect of government Bills. The last occasion on which a government Bill was so committed and reported to the House with amendments was as far back as 1917. In 1976 a Select Committee on the Hare Coursing Bill recommended that the Bill should not proceed and it was thereby killed. So it is not a procedure that has been in a great deal of use recently.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>A Select Committee on a Bill can hear evidence on the policy of the Bill, report on it like any Select Committee on a policy issue and, if it wishes, amend the Bill. That is the real difference between this type of committee and a normal Select Committee. I have to say to noble Lords that we have indeed made 400 amendments to the Bill, and the legislation now before the House reflects those changes.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Between 24 March and 24 June when we were charged to complete our report, we met twice a week for two to three hours at a time. That placed a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1138"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

considerable load on members of the committee and I should like to thank them for their assiduity and commitment. I thank also our Clerk, Mr Rhodri Walters, and our specialist adviser, Professor Andrew Le Sueur of the University of Birmingham, for their valuable assistance. I do not think that we could have produced a report which distilled so much evidence and so much argument into what I hope is a reasonably comprehensible form without the efforts of the Clerks and the special advisers.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I pay tribute also to the members of the committee. It was a committee divided on party lines, with five Labour members, five Conservatives, three Liberal Democrats and three Cross-Benchers. What I found especially heartening was the extent to which all members of the committee genuinely sought the maximum amount of agreement consonant with their individual views. It is not always the experience of someone in this building serving on a committee to find such a genuine search for consensus. In this case it seemed that there was, and I should like to make that public.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Finally, I thank the House for giving me the opportunity of chairing the committee. It was a stimulating and, as it turned out, very enjoyable task.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Our work was divided into three main phases. First, we met in public to take oral evidence from more than 32 witnesses. We received over 80 written submissions. We considered the views of 14 serving judges, seven retired judges, 14 academics, the lawyers&#039; professional bodies in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as campaign groups, individual lawyers and law firms, and members of the public. The evidence is published in Volume 2 of the report.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>This collation of the evidence and analysis of the facts and opinions about the reforms proposed in the Bill will, I hope, be of assistance to the House as it now resumes its scrutiny. I hope, too, that it provides a firm evidential basis for future argument, which no doubt will take place.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>During our deliberation stage we met in private to consider the central issues that had emerged from the evidence. In total, we identified and examined 44 separate issues. On many of those questions we were able to reach conclusions on the basis of consensus. On some, our report shows that the committee supports the policy of the Bill. On other issues, we agreed to amend the Bill on the basis of amendments tabled by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. Alternatively, we have indicated our support for amendments that the Government have undertaken to bring forward at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>It will be no surprise to noble Lords to learn that there were issues on which we did not reach agreement and consensus. Those included the two major questions of whether the office of Lord Chancellor should be abolished and whether a Supreme Court should be established. The committee was more or less evenly divided on those issues and we have explained the reasons for our disagreement in the report. Not only were we more or less evenly divided, but under the procedures of the committee the chairman had no <br>&nbsp;<br>

casting vote. However, I have to say that, even if he had had such a casting vote, he would not have exercised it because it would have defeated the whole object of the committee if we had voted along those lines. These are major constitutional changes and it is right that they are determined by Parliament as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>In the final, formal stages of our work, we amended the Bill and agreed our report. The amendments included those to which I have already alluded&#151;the ones brought forward by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor in response to our discussions. Here I should say in parenthesis how valuable it was to have the noble and learned Lord there as a member of the committee. He could hear the argument, he had the authority and, in circumstances in which he thought it proper, his flexibility and natural charm allowed him to agree. Not only that, we accepted amendments which we felt would give better effect to the concordat between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. Finally, we made a large number of minor drafting and technical amendments at the request of the Lord Chancellor. All the amendments were made by agreement.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>What of the points of disagreement? As we explain more fully in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the report, we took the view early on that little would be served by seeking to vote. Instead it was better to register the areas of our disagreement in the report itself. I think that some of my colleagues on the committee would also wish me to emphasise that, in those areas of disagreement, the fact that we have stood the clauses and schedules as part of the Bill does not imply that we all acquiesce to them, nor will it inhibit some of our number at least from registering such disagreements at later stages of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I turn briefly to some of the chief points we made. Given that the House set up the committee, which then collected evidence and sat for three months, I think it is quite important to put the committee&#039;s report in the context of this debate, and perhaps just as important to put the context of this debate in the framework of the report.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>In Chapter 2 we considered in detail the issues arising from the policy of the Bill to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor. Like most of our witnesses, we all agreed that change is inevitable. No one suggests turning the clock back to before 12 June last year when the Government announced their proposals for reform. None of us supports the idea that the Minister responsible for the courts should continue to sit as a judge. We all accept that the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales should be recognised as head of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>But what should be the characteristics of the Minister responsible for &quot;judiciary-related matters&quot;? About this we certainly disagreed. Some of us support the Government&#039;s policy that the Minister should be a mainstream Secretary of State, and so not necessarily a senior lawyer but possibly an MP rather than a Member of the House of Lords. Some of us believe that the Minister should continue to be called the Lord <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1140"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Chancellor and be a senior lawyer and a Member of the House of Lords. It will now be a matter for the Committee of the Whole House to consider this important issue further.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>It is also fair to say that there was, among those who wished to retain the office of Lord Chancellor, no clear agreement on what his precise functions would be. We hope that the analysis of the rival arguments set out in our report will provide a sound basis for this continuing debate.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>One of the issues we also examined, which was a fairly controversial one, was the proposal in the Bill to put the constitutional conventions safeguarding the independence of the judiciary, and the rule of law, on a statutory footing. The Government brought forward an amendment to the Bill to put that into statutory form. We all agreed that the Bill should say something about these matters and the report set out various options as to how the Bill could achieve this, but we were unable to reach a consensus about the best way forward.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>In the next chapter of our report we considered the proposal to create a Supreme Court for the United Kingdom. We received a wide range of views in evidence: some strongly supporting the idea that there should be a Supreme Court; some strongly supporting keeping the United Kingdom&#039;s highest court within the House of Lords. It will come as no surprise to anyone that there was no consensus within the committee on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Although we made no recommendations on the basic issue of whether there should be a Supreme Court, we did go on to make several important amendments to this part of the Bill. Indeed, this is a very good example of the way in which the committee approached its task. We disagreed on whether there should be a Supreme Court at all. We disagreed on whether commencement of this part of the Bill&#151;the commencement of the Supreme Court assuming its responsibilities&#151;should be delayed, pending a move to permanent premises.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Apart from those major issues, there was very considerable consensus. We agreed on the name of the court, the number of justices and that at least two should be Scottish. We agreed the qualifications for appointment to the Supreme Court. We agreed the composition of the selection commission. We agreed further that the selection commission should provide the name of only one candidate for appointment. We agreed the extent of consultation with senior justices and the devolved administrations.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>We agreed that the role of the Prime Minister should solely be to act as a conduit between Ministers and the Queen. We agreed on the provisions for acting justices and the supplementary panel. We agreed that the designation of the Supreme Court as a superior court of record should remain. We agreed that there was no need to change provisions of the Bill in respect of the Scottish civil and criminal appeals or the leave arrangements for Scottish civil appeals. We agreed with the proposal to transfer devolution jurisdiction from the Privy Council to the Supreme Court. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1141"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

agreed that the court should make its own rules. We agreed&#151;extremely importantly&#151;that the court should be established according to the model of a non-ministerial department, so that it would have greater control over its own financial and administrative agreements. We agreed that it should set its own fees.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We agreed that there should be an amendment to the Bill which safeguards the separate jurisdiction to be examined by the Supreme Court in respect of Scottish, Northern Irish, English and Welsh laws.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The effect of this procedure is that, if the House decides that it wants a Supreme Court to be established, many of the subsidiary issues will already have been considered in the committee and, I hope that the House will come to the conclusion, have been fairly dealt with. Of course, it will be open to the House to arrive at different conclusions, but I hope that the House will at least take the broad view that, having set up the committee and the committee having deliberated in the way that it has, the House should perhaps concentrate on the major issues. The virtue of this report is in the details, and I hope that we managed to give those details a thorough examination.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I apologise for taking some time before we reach the main debate of the day, but it is perhaps important that I spell out how we approached what we did.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="40713-05_time2"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40713-05_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Chapter 4 of the report deals with the reform of judicial appointments in England and Wales. We considered whether the Bill is correct to propose a recommending rather than an appointing Judicial Appointments Commission. We agreed&#151;some of us reluctantly&#151;that a recommending commission was a satisfactory system. We agreed that the composition of the 15-person commission struck the right balance between judicial and lay involvement. We accepted amendments proposed by the Government to ensure that every panel of the commission should include at least one judicial and one lay member. Some members of the committee took the view that the arrangements for the appointment of High Court judges needed to be altered. Accordingly, we made no recommendation about that.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>We were of one view in supporting the policy of the Bill that judicial appointments should be made on the basis of merit alone, and therefore accepted a government amendment to allow the Judicial Appointments Commission rather than the Minister to define &quot;merit&quot;. We also agreed that diversity among the judiciary should be promoted, without diluting the merit principle, to ensure that more women and people from ethnic minorities are able to serve as judges. We therefore made an amendment to the Bill encouraging specific reference in the guidance issued to the commission to the importance of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;encouraging diversity in the range of persons available for selection&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-05_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Chapter 5 of the report deals with two parliamentary matters of extreme importance, certainly to this House. Clause 94 of the Bill proposes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1142"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to remove the right of senior serving judges to participate in the legislative and scrutiny work of the House of Lords. It will be no surprise to anyone that on this&#151;as on the creation of the Supreme Court&#151;we did not reach a consensus. Whether or not judges are disqualified from Parliament, we considered a second question: should a parliamentary committee be established with general oversight of judicial matters? Our view was that such a committee was indeed desirable and could act as a valuable bridge between the legislature and the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40713-05_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>As to whether this procedure was a success, I confess that I have mixed views. If a Bill is properly prepared and launched after appropriate consultation, then a Select Committee of this sort should not be necessary; but where, as in this case, the proposed legislation involves major constitutional issues, I think that a gathering of the evidence and an examination of the arguments have proved useful. A great deal of ground has been covered and has been cleared, and the Bill is now in a much better state than it was at Second Reading.

<a name="40713-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>It is my responsibility to begin the Committee stage by moving Amendment No. 1. This amendment is linked with Amendment No. 7 and a number of clause stand part debates, as noble Lords will see from the Marshalled List and the groupings list. Essentially, the issue is this. The Government wish to expunge the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from our constitution. They wish to do so because they think that the office has now outserved its usefulness. We, the Opposition, disagree. We believe that the office still has a vital role in protecting the rule of law in our country.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1143"></a>

</p>

<a name="40713-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>When the debate on Amendment No. 1 is ended, it is almost certain that the matter will be put to the test. I would not wish any of your Lordships, therefore, to underestimate the importance of the occasion. But, at the same time, I would not wish your Lordships to oversimplify it. The question of whether or not the office of Lord Chancellor ought to survive has to be seen in the context of the Government&#039;s Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>There have been several debates on the Bill and many noble Lords will by now be familiar with its content. I should like to say at the outset that not only the Opposition but, I believe, a large number of your Lordships accept many of the provisions in the Bill; and the Select Committee stage has helped to crystallise our thoughts on the issues in detail. We sympathise with the initiative to set up a Judicial Appointments Committee; we support the conclusion of a concordat with the Lord Chief Justice; we accept that it is no longer appropriate for the Lord Chancellor to sit in the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Taken together, all these initiatives represent perhaps the most dramatic change in the judicial arm of our constitution since the Act of Settlement. The changes will replace decision-making on the work of the judicial arm by one individual&#151;the Lord Chancellor&#151;with a tripartite arrangement divided between the Judicial Appointments Commission, the Lord Chief Justice and the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I emphasise at the outset of the debate that it is not the Opposition&#039;s intention to unravel, in any way, the architecture of the Bill; we accept the tripartite architecture in full. Our only concern, encapsulated in Amendment No. 1, is whether the position of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs is sufficiently powerful to carry out the tasks stipulated in the Bill for that role.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Over the past six months, many noble Lords have speculated long and hard about what it was on 12 June 2003 that led the Government to make their announcement about the position of the Lord Chancellor. Much time has passed and the Select Committee has had a chance to look at the matter dispassionately. In taking our decision today, we have to test, against the new architecture in the Bill, whether the Government&#039;s decision on 12 June&#151;or purported decision because they could not put it into effect&#151;was right.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>In order to test this, I should like to refer your Lordships to two parts of the evidence. The first part was given in a most imaginative contribution by Professor Robert Hazell, who is the head of the Constitution Unit at University College London. He put the issue in this way. He said that in any modern Cabinet there are two forces&#151;the forces of order and the forces of law&#151;and successful government requires those two forces to be in balance, and he added that there is a real concern in many modern governments that the force of order will prove too strong for the force of justice.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40713-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>In his response to the consultation by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, on the question of the survival of the office, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;Fourthly, we do not in this response comment on the proposal to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor. We are, however, very greatly concerned that the important constitutional values which the office of Lord Chancellor protected should continue to be effectively protected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Will the proposed office of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs deliver what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, wants?
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The component parts of the office have been described on several occasions by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and others. It is envisaged that the office will normally be occupied by a party politician, who is not a lawyer, in another place and without any special precedence in the Cabinet. It is my view that an office so constituted will prove a deeply inadequate protection for the rule of law in our nation.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I derive some support for saying that from the experience of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in respect of the ouster clause in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill, now thankfully no longer in the text. In his Squire centennial speech in Cambridge, a few months ago, the noble and learned Lord Woolf, in the heat of contesting the clause, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;I am worried about a Department for Constitutional Affairs becoming a subsidiary of the Home Office or unable to compete with the dominance of the Home Office. The result could be the Home Office being in a position to dictate the agenda for the courts, which would not accord with the need for independence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>If that is the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on the present state of the office of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, what changes are necessary in the Bill to remedy this defect? I shall suggest what changes we believe are necessary.

</p>

<a name="40713-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>First, the individual who occupies the office of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs must, in our view, be a senior and experienced lawyer. This follows not only from the stipulations of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the Judicial Appointments Committee and the requirements of the concordat; it is also very hard to see, on a dispassionate reading, how anyone other than an experienced, qualified lawyer could possibly perform his constitutional duties.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Further, the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs are also to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. What have been the great challenges to the rule of law over the past three years? The introduction of propensity evidence in the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the purported ouster clause earlier this year in the asylum Bill; and an attempt&#151;which luckily failed&#151;to change the burden of proof in a number of other criminal matters. In order to contest such matters in Cabinet the Secretary of State for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1145"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Constitutional Affairs will have to have a real, in-depth grasp of the criminal law. I do not see how someone can perform the role without having legal qualifications.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Secondly, in my submission, the Secretary of State will have to be in your Lordships&#039; House. This is not only because there is a poverty of qualified lawyers coming from another place to your Lordships&#039; House; but also because your Lordships&#039; House is able to stand back from the hurly-burly of political life in another place and assess the constitutional implications of Bills that come to it, or decisions that are made about those Bills. Again, Professor Robert Hazell, in his evidence, saw your Lordships&#039; House as the natural guardian of the constitution, a view recently endorsed by the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, in his report on your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>But would a Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&#151;legally qualified and a Member of your Lordships&#039; House&#151;do the job that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor now does? It seems to me highly unlikely that he would.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>It is just imaginable that someone could still emerge from another place. My noble and learned friend Lord Howe served as a Law Officer and held two great offices of state in the 1980s as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary. If the noble and learned Lord, with all those qualifications, had been made Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs in your Lordships&#039; House, I have no doubt that he would have carried the same amount of political clout as if he had been made Lord Chancellor.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="40713-06_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40713-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>But in the 21st century, I am afraid, there will be almost no Lord Howes coming off the production line in another place. Sadly, very few lawyers of that quality are able to enter politics in another place. Future Secretaries of State for Constitutional Affairs will come direct from the legal profession into your Lordships&#039; House carrying no political clout at all. Their political clout will derive from the office that they hold. The office of Lord Chancellor will provide them with that clout&#151;its prestige, its status, its weight, its parallel classification with the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is why maintaining the office of Lord Chancellor is so crucial in our constitutional arrangements. It is the only guarantee that, in the deliberations of the Cabinet, the rule of law will stand up to the predatory ambitions of those who represent the forces of order.
</p>

<a name="40713-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The Government have sought to promote the notion of the separation of powers as being at the heart of our constitution. It is not. It is not the separation of powers but the balance of powers that matters in our constitution. The Lord Chancellor in the Cabinet is a great inconvenience to the executive. That is the reason he should stay there. I beg to move.

<a name="40713-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I too would like to add my tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, for chairing the Select Committee in the way he did and for producing a report in record time.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>At Second Reading I dared to suggest that it might be possible to produce a report by the end of July. Without wanting to be too controversial at this stage of my speech, I should say that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor described that as fanciful. In fact we succeeded in doing it by the end of June. For that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Richard. What a good report it is; it is a model of clarity. I would particularly like to emphasise the point which the noble Lord, Lord Richard, made at the end of his address&#151;that it will provide a very useful precedent if ever again we are presented with a Bill which ought to have received pre-legislative scrutiny, but which for one reason or another has not had it. We do not know what the reason was in this case; we have not been told. The report will be a very useful precedent for the future.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I see that I have already spoken for 15 minutes&#151;but perhaps the clock has not been changed. One of the advantages of the Select Committee procedure is that some of the issues which seemed to loom so large have now disappeared altogether and all the issues are now in much better focus. The proposed abolition of the Lord Chancellor is a very good example of that. Everybody now agrees that the Lord Chancellor&#151;if the post and office are retained, as I profoundly hope that they are&#151;should no longer sit as a judge. In some ways I regret that, because some recent Lord Chancellors have been very good judges indeed. In the absence of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, I can say that he is a very good example of how good a judge a Lord Chancellor can be.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>But I accept that there are problems with a judge sitting as a member of the Cabinet, particularly, it seems, among the newly joined members of the European Union. So it is now common ground that if the Lord Chancellor is retained, he should be debarred from sitting as a judge. It is also common ground that he should no longer be solely responsible, as he has been in the past, for selecting the judiciary. We all agree that that task will now be performed by the new Judicial Appointments Commission, to which we all look forward.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>So what, having got rid of those functions, is left? Sometimes, listening to the Lord Chancellor, one has had the impression that almost nothing would be left. But that of course is quite wrong; there will still be a huge job for the Lord Chancellor. In the first place he will run the courts, including the magistrates&#039; courts, as he has always done. Secondly, he will have his role of defending the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and being&#151;as has so often been said&#151;the voice of the judges in Cabinet. Thirdly, he will have his role as Speaker of this House. I will say no more about that because it will be a question for this House whether he should continue as Speaker. So I put that on one side.

</p>

<a name="40713-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>As for the other functions, they are exactly the same functions as would be transferred to the new Secretary of State under this Bill. That is a point on which we reached agreement. I hope to quote very little from the report, but I will quote paragraph 43, which stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;The Committee agrees that in view of the Concordat the future duties of the Lord Chancellor/Secretary of State office-holder should be responsibility for &#039;judiciary-related&#039; matters (that is, the provision of systems to support the carrying on of the business of courts and tribunals, judicial appointments, and overseeing judicial discipline); and responsibilities as the &#039;constitutional conscience&#039; of Government, defending judicial independence and the rule of law in Cabinet&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>So there you have it&#151;the Select Committee is agreed that the two jobs will be exactly the same. That prompts the question of what on earth the point is of transferring those functions from the Lord Chancellor, where they will rest under our scheme, to the new Secretary of State. I suggest that that is a question to which we have never heard a convincing answer.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Let me very briefly remind the Committee of the arguments that have been advanced from time to time. There are four in all. First, there is the argument based on separation of powers&#151;that it is wrong for a judge to sit in Cabinet. But once we take away the judicial role, as everybody agrees, that argument falls flat on its face.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Secondly, there is the argument that there is too much for the Lord Chancellor to do. That was an argument that featured very largely in the original consultation paper. It was almost the only argument. But again, once we take away the judicial role and his role in selecting and appointing the judges, we have exactly the same role as that proposed for the Secretary of State. So that argument, too, falls to the ground.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Thirdly, there is the argument&#151;a difficult argument perhaps at first to comprehend&#151;of the so-called inherent tension or conflict in the role of the Lord Chancellor. That is an argument which featured very largely in the speech of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on 12 February, and in his written and oral evidence to the Select Committee. The argument is that on the one hand the Lord Chancellor has to uphold the rule of law, and that on the other he has to run a great department. He argues that those roles are in conflict and therefore should be split. Since this is such an important argument, I should again quote the Lord Chancellor&#039;s argument in his own words. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;My Lords, the Lord Chancellor must form a view about where the rule of law is being infringed. That will frequently bring him into conflict with his political role. If it does, the rule of law must prevail&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Then the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of the Shaws, intervened and asked:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Can we be confident that a Secretary of State with ambition will not side with the political part of his background, as distinct from that which will protect the rule of law? That is where our anxieties lie&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1148"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;My Lords, that point is absolutely rightly and forcefully put. The question that the abolition of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role raises is: can you go on with a &#163;3 billion budget? With these policy responsibilities&#151;a responsibility for being the protector of the judiciary and the upholder of the rule of law&#151;there is an obvious conflict. The conflict has become greater and greater. The separation of powers is not some abstract concept. It is preventing your role as a Minister overtopping your role as the protector of the constitution or preventing your role as a protector of the constitution overtopping your role as a Minister. Eventually, we are getting to the point where that conflict cannot be contained in one office&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>At that point, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, intervened to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;That seems a rum old argument from the Lord Chancellor&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/2/04; col. 1318.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Whether it is a rum old argument or not, the problem is that exactly the same argument will apply to the Secretary of State, because he will be running the same department and defending the independence of the judiciary under Clause 1. Therefore, how can the Lord Chancellor rid himself of this inherent tension and conflict simply by changing his name, unless the duty under Clause 1 is not intended to press on him too heavily? I asked the Lord Chancellor that very question&#151;question 29 on page 29&#151;and I did not get a very satisfactory answer.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I therefore come to the fourth and last argument that has been advanced. It is said that the Prime Minister should be free to appoint whoever he wants to run the courts&#151;free to appoint a Member of the other place who is not a lawyer and could be quite junior in Cabinet ranking. That is the real difference between the two sides in this debate. In my view, the task of defending judicial independence in the Cabinet is of such critical importance that it should be given to a senior judge or lawyer who is a Member of this House and not to a politician on his way up the greasy pole.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Why do I say that the Prime Minister&#039;s role should be limited in this way but not in others, because after all, nobody would suggest that the Secretary of State for Defence should be a soldier or sailor? The distinction is almost too obvious to state. The Army must do what the Government say: there is no room for conflict or tension. However, the courts do not have to do what the Government say. Indeed, it is the other way round. It is the task of the courts to ensure that the Government do what Parliament says, which is very different. Therefore, there is obvious scope for friction between the judiciary and the executive, which may be getting wider all the time&#151;although I hope that it is not. However, since such scope exists, it is essential to have someone running the courts who has the respect of both sides&#151;the judiciary and the executive.
</p>

<a name="40713-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>For similar reasons, it is essential to have someone who is a Member of this House, so that he can, as far as possible, be kept away from the hurly-burly of political conflict in the House of Commons. That would have the incidental advantage, often mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, of having two Cabinet Ministers in this House instead of one. We all know <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1149"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1149</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that our constitution depends on checks and balances, and that is especially important when one party or the other has a huge majority. One such check is the presence of the Lord Chancellor in the Cabinet. Of course, it is possible to exaggerate his influence, but I hope that I do not do that. I accept that he can always be dismissed by the Prime Minister. However, until he is, the check is there and we get rid of it at our peril.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40713-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   This group of amendments concerns the future title of the Minister at the head of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In speaking to Amendments Nos. 1 and 7 in this group, I will have to discuss our own Amendment No. 8, which proposes the alternative name for the office of Secretary of State for Justice. Our position on Amendments Nos. 1 and 7 cannot be explained without reference to that alternative name. I asked to have Amendment No. 8 grouped with Amendments Nos. 1 and 7. That has not been done, so I will have to speak to Amendment No. 8 in this debate and I promise the Committee that I will not speak to it again when we reach the point at which it appears on the list.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said in his very informative introduction to this debate, there was broad consensus in the Select Committee on what the Minister should and should not do. It was agreed that the Minister should not sit as a judge, should not be head of the judiciary in England and Wales and should have only a limited role in the appointment and promotion of the judiciary&#151;a step that would greatly protect the independence of the judiciary. It was agreed that the Minister should continue to be head of his department, which is now a substantial department with a budget of more than &#163;3 billion a year including legal aid. It was agreed that the Minister should have a role as defender of the independence of the judiciary and of the rule of law and that that should be recognised in the Bill, although we have not yet achieved consensus on the text.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The disputes that remain, therefore, are not about the functions of the Minister. They are: first, whether the Minister should have legal qualifications; secondly, whether he&#151;I use the word &quot;he&quot; because of the current convention for using the gender of the present holder of the office&#151;should have to be a Member of your Lordships&#039; House; and thirdly, what he should be called. In a way, I regret that the title of the office has come first in the debate. It might have been better to tackle the other issues first so that we could see what kind of creature we were describing.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Titles are symbolic, but that does not mean that the issue is unimportant. Symbols have potency. However, it is plain that the new office is very different from the old one. In the past, the office had both judicial and political functions. Certainly, at times in the past the judicial functions were the more important of the two&#151;as, for example, in the time of Lord Eldon, who was Lord Chancellor for some 20 years between 1805 and 1825 and spent most of his time sitting as judge of the Chancery Court.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1150"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Now, of course, the judicial role, or the vestiges of it, are to be removed. The question is whether the title of Lord Chancellor should go with it. It would be possible to retain the name of Lord Chancellor for the remaining functions of the Minister. There are arguments for that. First, continuity would be maintained. Secondly, it is said that if it is at least coupled with the requirement that the Minister should have legal qualifications and be a Member of your Lordships&#039; House, it would strengthen the standing and independence of the Minister and his ability to stand up to Cabinet colleagues to protect the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. That argument has been clearly and forcefully put by both the previous speakers.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I am not persuaded. The question of legal qualifications and membership of your Lordships&#039; House does not arise out of this group of amendments. It is a matter for later groups. We can see the advantage of having legal qualifications, but I do not believe that an intelligent and well informed lay person is incapable of understanding and defending the rule of law. Lawyers tend to have somewhat fixed and rigid views on this subject, and it is more than possible that an outsider could have a better understanding of the constitutional implications. However, that is a different issue. We shall be voting not on whether the Minister should have a legal qualification, but simply on whether he should be called Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>We are certainly opposed to making it the rule that the Minister, as head of a department with a significant budget, should necessarily be a Member of your Lordships&#039; House, whether or not there are suitable candidates for this office in another place. We need a Minister, in your Lordships&#039; House or not, legally qualified or not, called whatever title, who will stand up for the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. Will retaining the historic office or title of Lord Chancellor strengthen the hand of the Minister in defending judicial independence and the rule of law? The answer is no. The standing and authority of the Minister depends on the character and quality of the person who holds the office, the willingness of the Prime Minister to choose a person who has the character and quality to do the job, and the willingness of the Prime Minister to heed that person&#039;s advice.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>We have had a series of strong and effective Lord Chancellors in recent years. The late Lord Hailsham and the noble and learned Lords, Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Lord Irvine of Lairg, all fall into that category. They were strong and effective not because they were called Lord Chancellor but because they were strong and effective people appointed by Prime Ministers who were willing to appoint such people.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Not all Lord Chancellors have been strong and effective. It would be invidious to name names, but there is no magic about the title. As shown on 12 June 2003, the Lord Chancellor, however strong, is a Cabinet Minister who can be sacked by the Prime Minister like any other Minister. A future Prime Minister who wants a compliant Lord Chancellor will <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

find one. The mystique attached to the office of Lord Chancellor was shattered by the events of June last year and I do not believe that it can be reconstructed.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>That was a concern expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in his speech at which I was present in Cambridge on 3 March this year, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;I also have doubts whether it would be possible now to restore the special culture that needs to exist if the Lord Chancellor is to successfully combine his different and conflicting responsibilties&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Professor Robert Hazell, head of the constitution unit at University College, London, as someone who regretted the announcement that the office was to be abolished, said in evidence to the committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The damage may well have been done. The Government, having decided to abolish the office, in a way have broken the vase and it may be too late to put the pieces together again&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>We do not see the retention of the office of Lord Chancellor as being a necessary or even valuable addition to that role. We also have to say, however, that we are not happy with the title of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, which is an inaccurate description of the office. We have long advocated the title of Minister of Justice or Secretary of State for Justice.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Justice is the core role of the department and the Minister. The department has some constitutional roles that cannot be described as justice matters. For example, it is an umbrella department for devolution and it is responsible for the conduct of elections. Those are fringe activities that should probably go elsewhere. But the administration of the court system, the role in judicial appointments and discipline of the judiciary, responsibility for legal aid, and for civil law and procedure are central to the department. What it lacks&#151;and should get&#151;is responsibility for criminal law and procedure, which would leave responsibility for prisons and police with the Home Secretary. That would leave us with a Ministry of Justice responsible for law and a Home Office responsible for order. That is a logical division of responsibility, which has been adopted in most other democratic countries, and which should be adopted here.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>We cannot expect the transfer of criminal law from the Home Office to the Ministry of Justice while the present Home Secretary remains in office. The &quot;Secretary of State for Justice&quot; accurately describes the present functions of the Minister and the department and points out the direction in which the department should move to become a fully fledged Department of Justice. A move in that direction as soon as possible is essential to give the Minister equal standing with the Home Secretary, which cannot be achieved by retaining the historic title.
</p>

<a name="40713-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>If we cannot have the title of Secretary of State for Justice, although I hope that it is possible, we are faced with an unattractive choice. Do we support the retention of the historic title when the office to which it was attached has been transformed into something completely different, or do we support the introduction of a new title, which is an incomplete and inaccurate description of the duties of the office?

<a name="40713-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The movement to our objectives&#151;the Ministry of Justice and the Minister of Justice&#151;will be easier if we can move to a new name now, even if it is not one that we ultimately want. That name recognises rather than conceals the change of function of the Minister. While I am entirely sympathetic to the motives of those who wish to retain the title of Lord Chancellor, they are misguided in believing that it will have that effect. We do not believe that the retention of an outdated title will assist the protection of judicial independence and the rule of law. We shall therefore vote against the amendment.

I am also conscious of the fact that it is now some 32 years since I last wore a wig in anger, so I am to some extent disqualified in that respect as well.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>During the intervening years, I have had the opportunity of presenting and discussing the reputation of our legal system in this country in many other parts of the world as Foreign Secretary and, in the decade or so following that, as an adviser to one of      the world&#039;s largest American law firms. Throughout the world, our legal system, because of its structure and shape, commands universal respect which we put at peril with great unwisdom.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>It is interesting that that was clearly recognised by Her Majesty&#039;s Government only a very short time before the events of 12 June&#151;to be compared almost with 9/11 in their folly. When the Council of Europe pressed the Government to explain the extraordinary anomaly of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role, emphasising the separation of powers and so on, the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department submitted a long paper in response to Mr Eric Jurgens&#039;s motion in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which explained the position as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;The Lord Chancellor provides a counter-balance for the judicial branch against the centralised power of government and Parliament . . . he is removed to the House of Lords, away from the full force of party politics. The Lord Chancellor is always a senior lawyer or judge, and therefore comes to government imbued with full understanding of legal culture and the rule of law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>He is thus,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;both a link and bulwark between the judiciary and the executive and the legislature&quot;.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;imbued with full understanding of legal culture and the rule of law&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>goes a long way to answering the point most recently made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. That is the position as it was until June last year.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="40713-09_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40713-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>We are all agreed, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has pointed out&#151;and I join in paying tribute to his chairmanship&#151;on the acceptability of discarding the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor, and of saying a sad farewell to his sitting on the Woolsack in this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1153"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

House. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, said, and we recorded in our report, the old days when the Lord Chancellor spent the first half of the day sitting judicially and the second half sitting as Speaker have, for better or for worse, gone for ever. We know that his sitting in this House was short-lived; the late Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, actually sat as a judge during his three years on only two cases. The nature of the job is therefore not substantially changed by that alteration, and the case that the Government were making remains exactly as strong as it was when they made it to the Council of Europe.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland has already quoted from the judges&#039; response to the initial decision explaining why the Law Lords wished the office to continue with its present strength and reputation. But that support for the present state of affairs is also supported very powerfully and clearly by the report of the Constitutional Affairs Committee in the other place from 10 February this year. The committee said, referring to Lord Chancellors of recent times, that all have been distinguished within the legal profession, to which they have professed great loyalty. It went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;There is a radical difference between on the one hand a Lord Chancellor . . . who has a special constitutional importance enjoyed by no other member of the Cabinet and who is usually at the end of his career (and thus without temptations associated with possible advancement) and on the other hand a Minister who is a full-time politician, who is not bound by any judicial oath and who may be a middle-ranking or junior member of the Cabinet with hopes of future promotion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>That is the second essential distinction. That general argument is, interestingly, robustly supported by a noble friend in familiar disguise&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Lester, under the heading of the Odysseus Trust. Under the heading,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;Arrangements to replace office of Lord Chancellor&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>the evidence that the Select Committee received from that quarter said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;We strongly favour the creation of a powerful Minister of Justice, with the legal stature and qualifications of a traditional Lord Chancellor, and a specific duty to uphold the rule of law and the independence and integrity of the judicial system&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>There we have, from the Liberal Democrat Benches, support for the proposition that the office holder needs to have,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;the legal stature and qualifications of a traditional Lord Chancellor&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>That is no doubt a recognition that that is the right way of securing, more surely, in the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, a &quot;strong and effective&quot; holder of this important office&#151;someone qualified in that way.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Three things follow from that analysis, which are quite familiar. First, we need to have in that office a distinguished senior figure at the end of his career. Paragraph 36 of our report sums it up in the following words. The holder must have,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;reached the pinnacle as well as the culmination of his political and legal career&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1154"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>That plainly means a senior lawyer. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Kingsland for his generous tribute to the expiring breed that I appear to represent. He will also remember that in the course of our committee&#039;s deliberations, the original phraseology was not,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;culmination of his political and legal career&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>but &quot;terminal&quot;. That was kindly altered to a happier word.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The second proposition, which is again familiar to the Committee, is that the holder of the office should be in this House. There are good practical reasons for that. First, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland, said, sadly there are almost no leading lawyers left in the other place. When I was fortunate enough to be appointed Solicitor General, there were at least half a dozen Members of my own party clamouring and competing for that job, and I counted myself extremely lucky to get it. There were at least as many on the other side of the House, many of them of real distinction.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Alas, if one goes to the other place now, one looks not quite in vain, but one finds people with that kind of qualification only with difficulty. The evidence for that is that the two Attorney-Generals under this Government have both been Members of this House. For the first time for many centuries, that office has had to be held in this House. So the idea that there may be spare lawyers of the distinction and quality to be appointed to holder of this office simply lying around on the Benches of the House of Commons is certainly a myth. I must say with some sadness that the decline was demonstrated by the fact that for a short time the shadow Attorney-General was not a practising lawyer of any kind but a parliamentary agent. That illustrates the extent to which the holder of this office, if he is to be a senior lawyer, must be in this House.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Another important point relating to why the holder should be in this House comes from remarks by Professor Robert Hazell. Paragraph 65 of our report said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;The House of Lords has a particularly important role to play as a guardian of the constitution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>That was rightly endorsed, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland pointed out, by the Wakeham Royal Commission. Professor Hazell went on by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;If . . . one important function of the Lord Chancellor or Secretary of State is to be a guardian of the constitution, then in that respect it is entirely appropriate for that Minister to be a Member of this House&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The third conclusion relates to the title of the office. If the office holder is to have the qualifications of a senior lawyer and Member of this House, with the duties imposed on him as we are all agreed, one comes back to that old phrase that if it looks like a duck and if it walks like a duck, it probably is a duck. If this creature&#039;s qualifications are going to be equivalent to those of the present Lord Chancellor, why on earth should we not call it Lord Chancellor?
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The name matters not just because of the nomenclature of the office but because of the historic authority attached to that title. I noted the rather light-hearted way in which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was happy to dismiss that antique title. I understand <br>&nbsp;<br>

the thinking behind the notion of a Minister of Justice but, frankly, we do not have a Ministry of Justice and we do have a hugely important and long-respected office of Lord Chancellor. It is not sensible to say that the title has been so badly damaged by the way in which the Government have handled it that we should simply shed a few tears over the broken vase and let it lie.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>This will be the last time I quote from Professor Robert Hazell, but it is interesting to read his description of his understanding of the question, which was in the very first evidence before the committee. He said that he could understand why the Government were ready to discard the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor and his role as Speaker of this House. But he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;I do not understand why the Government wanted also to throw away his first hat and abolish the title for the function as a Cabinet Minister. No convincing reason was advanced in the consultation paper and I am not sure that any has been subsequently. It seemed almost as if the Government were casting down the title of Lord Chancellor in an act of mindless modernisation and it certainly put the judiciary in a fright. It raised unnecessary fears that the independence of the judiciary was under threat and that in casting aside the office the Government were also casting aside the values which the Lord Chancellor upheld as the constitutional conscience of the Government and as the protector of the judiciary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>That is the head of the constitution unit at University College, London, describing his impression of the impact made by the reckless decision to discard the office of Lord Chancellor. We cannot respond to that by saying, &quot;Well, it&#039;s too bad chaps&#151;it&#039;s gone so let it go&quot;. If we are going to maintain the authority of the office holder, we need to do what we can to repair the damage that has been recklessly committed. It shows the damage done to the vase and I am not prepared to accept it.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>That impression is powerfully reinforced by some observations made from time to time by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor himself. In last week&#039;s edition of the <i>House Magazine</i>, that immensely influential organ, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Why should any Prime Minister be constrained in the person he chooses to do that job&#151;constrained by it having to be a lawyer, constrained by it having to be a member of the House of Lords? The key thing is quality of the individual, and the Prime Minister should have the widest possible choice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I see no wisdom in that whatever. If so many people on all sides of our society, and certainly in the world outside, attach great importance to the legal qualifications&#151;senior lawyer qualifications&#151;and membership of this House, surely we should respect those views. As I look at that observation by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and the insight that it gives one into his thinking, I am reminded of the cynical legal comment that even in an affidavit the truth will out.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The Lord Chancellorship is the most remarkable and important aspect of our constitution. Yet the shape of that office depends not on statute but on what our constitution depends&#151;that is, conventions. If one looks up constitutional law and human rights in the relevant volume of <i>Halsbury&#039;s Laws of England</i>, as I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1156"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

did, to find the qualifications of the Lord Chancellor, one finds that there are no statutory qualifications for the office of Lord Chancellor although it has,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;long been the practice to appoint a member or a former member of the Bar, often but by no means always from among the Bench or someone who has been Attorney General or Solicitor General&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>That is the foundation of this cornerstone of our constitution. Over centuries, the quality, qualifications and authority have been defined and upheld by constitutional convention and by convention alone&#151;convention that this Government have been recklessly disposed to overthrow, with possibly far-reaching consequences.
</p>

<a name="40713-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I do not want to use the phraseology of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, but the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is personally a most engaging colleague. For that reason, I do not relish having to make my next remark. But I have to say that I do not find it easy to respect someone, however personally agreeable, who has the privilege of being appointed to such an historic and constitutionally vital office and is then disposed, at little more than a moment&#039;s notice, to set about its demolition. In order to prevent such constitutional vandalism&#151;I make no apology for repeating the phrase&#151;that office now has to be recreated, preserved and strengthened. It is no longer a convention rightly respected over centuries. It now has to be restored by Act of Parliament. It has to be restored by the will of this House.

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40713-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   The Bill provides a new and fundamentally different framework for the constitutional position of our judiciary that does not involve a Lord Chancellor. Those who propose these amendments assert that the role of Lord Chancellor should continue, and they essentially rely on its antiquity and the supposed scope of its functions to justify its retention. They particularly rely, as did the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on the role of the Lord Chancellor in protecting the independence of the judiciary. I will henceforth call that &quot;the role&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>That approach confuses the office with the functions. I strongly disagree with the approach and I regret to say, but will say, I hope forcefully, that the contention does not survive objective analysis. The Bill is intended to reform. It will preserve the best of the past to advance the future but will not be trapped by the past in making that future constitutionally good.

</p>

<a name="40713-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Let me start with history. Before this debate, I had occasion to look at each of the major textbooks on constitutional law and history, in particular, Dicey. In none of them did I find any significant reference to the role of protecting the independence of the judiciary. It simply was not there. Indeed, when I looked at the history, what was there was the predilection of Lords Chancellor up to the Second World War to appoint judges, up to and including the Lord Chief Justice, by dint of political patronage and not merit. In my research, I found that it was only in 1975 that the Lord Chancellor&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1157"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Hailsham&#151;first explicitly expressed the role of defending the independence of the judiciary inside the Cabinet and in Parliament as important.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>But on what basis can it be defended? We are fortunate in Lords Chancellor such as the noble and learned Lords, Lord Mackay and Lord Irvine, but do we know if they ever had occasion to defend the independence of the judiciary in the Cabinet? If so, on what principle did they defend it? It is not written; it is not even mentioned in the textbooks. Perhaps that might indicate to us that this is exaggerating a problem. The independence of the judiciary of this nation is protected not by the Cabinet and not by the Lord Chancellor, but ultimately by us in Parliament. I shall now develop that contention.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>As to the functions of the Lord Chancellor as judge or senior judge, nobody can plausibly argue that he should sit. It is better that he does not. The Bill does away with that. As to his function as Speaker of this House, is it acceptable that a senior Cabinet Minister should spend so much time here as is required when his main function is to serve the public interest in his own ministry? Perhaps we should change our procedures.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The only area in which this debate is significant is in the administration of justice. Within that, the only issue that is seriously raised for the retention of the Lord Chancellor is the role in protecting the independence of the judiciary. I disagree with that emphasis. The independence of our judiciary as to security of tenure, appointment and discipline rests with Parliament. For 300 years, the judges of this country have been independent and have had security of tenure; that is since the Act of Settlement. Politicians respect that independence. Judges, realising that they have it, show its importance by the integrity with which they bear office. It does not and did not need a Lord Chancellor to produce that constitutional position.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The system of appointment by the Lord Chancellor&#151;not in terms of personalities, but as a system&#151;has been heavily criticised. The Bill changes it to an independent commission, the assessment and recommendation of which will have to be decided on by a Minister. If he disagrees, he must explain in a reasoned&#151;in which I include that it would be rational&#151;explanation why he did not accept a recommendation. That is very different from times past. It does not involve a Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Lastly, there is discipline. The Bill creates a new system of discipline, effectively exercisable by the Lord Chief Justice on behalf of Ministers, with prescribed procedures and an overview by an ombudsman. That is better than before, and it does not need a Lord Chancellor. Those functions&#151;security of tenure, appointment, discipline&#151;are all developed in the Bill for the better. They do not depend upon a Minister.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>What of the role, the critical question of whether the Lord Chancellor must be there to protect the judges? That is the ultimate and only question arising in the amendments. Of the three branches of power in a democracy, the judiciary is the weakest&#151;the least able <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1158"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to protect itself, because of its independence and its inability to enter public debate. It is therefore everybody&#039;s democratic duty to ensure that it is properly protected. A constitutional principle is needed to do it, and that is what the Bill creates. It makes for new and better protection of the judiciary, for the following reasons.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>First, the concordat agreed in January of this year is an historic and unique document. It is the first time in our history when the judges and the Government have agreed together on the best way to manage the judiciary. It is founded on a welcome concept of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;real and effective partnership between the Government and the judiciary&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>which is seen as being &quot;paramount&quot;. That is an advance. It does not need a Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The concordat is substantially embodied in the Bill. However, it includes a new, enhanced and much more powerful role for the Lord Chief Justice. By Clause 2, he becomes the president of the courts of England and Wales. In that role, he has a statutory duty to represent the judges. He must manage their administration and he must deal with Ministers and Parliament in all of those duties. This is new, different and important, and it does not involve a Lord Chancellor&#151;far from it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40713-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Will he bear in mind that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said in his evidence that he saw no reason why the concordat, to which everybody attaches importance, should not work with a Lord Chancellor or a Secretary of State? He could see no difference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40713-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for reminding me of that fact, but I should like to concentrate, before I return to answer that point, on the question of what the Lord Chief Justice is to do.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The new role appears to be little understood. It is assumed that the Lord Chancellor is the only person who can represent the judiciary. The Bill says different. The Lord Chief Justice, as well as the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, will represent the judges and their independence. He will do so with Ministers and Parliament and if necessary do so by public debate, if he feels that that independence is under threat. He will not be trammelled by political constraint where a Lord Chancellor would be.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>My next point will enable me to deal with the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. The role of the Lord Chief Justice fits in with and is fortified by the constitutional guarantee in Clause 1 of the continued independence of the judiciary. That involves all Ministers involved in justice and every Minister, whether in justice or not, is forbidden from interfering with judicial decision making. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, reminded me of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said. What <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1159"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

he said was that it may be the Lord Chancellor, or it may not. He did not say that it has to be the Lord Chancellor. Prudence on his part would surely lead him not to overstate at this stage the new role that the Bill gives to him. The role of the Lord Chief Justice and the constitutional guarantee work together.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40713-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. Will he not accept that there is no guarantee whatever in Clause 1 and that it is wholly unacceptable to suggest that there is a guarantee? Does he not appreciate that in paragraphs 75 to 79 of the committee&#039;s report reservations were expressed by noble and learned Lords and by Lady Justice Arden about enforcement? The black-type guarantee of judicial independence, as the noble Lord must know, is a marginal gloss. It is not part of the statute or the Bill. It cannot be amended and it cannot be referred to as an aid to interpretation; and in any event it is totally misleading and wrong.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40713-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   It is embarrassing to remind ourselves that in 2002, we in Parliament enacted a guarantee similar to this to protect the judges of Northern Ireland. Did we then, in doing so, consider that it was of no effect, that it was a gloss? Of course we did not. We wrote it then as we write it now in the Bill&#151;as a constitutional provision. We may be little accustomed to dealing with written constitutions in this country, but it is time that we started to learn to use them with the intended effect that they are intended to have.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>How is the guarantee to be honoured? That is the question implicit in the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell. It will be honoured in many different ways. The Secretary of the Cabinet, in his proper constitutional position, properly exercised, could not for a moment permit Cabinet discussion to occur in which political interest was threatening the independence of the judiciary, if this clause is law. It is unthinkable that that could occur.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Secondly, if there is difficulty about the independence of the judiciary in Cabinet, the Attorney-General can attend. It was only in 1992 that the Attorney-General stopped representing the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons on all of these questions. Thirdly, and in any event under the Bill, the Lord Chief Justice himself will have the right to make representations, in public if necessary, to ensure that the guarantee is honoured.
</p>

<a name="40713-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Last and most important of all, when a constitution is written it is not Ministers or judges who give it the final protection&#151;it is this Parliament. Would we be so supine as to allow this guarantee to have no effect? Are we not prepared to use the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs and give it strength to make it an effective guarantee? Are we not prepared to debate in this House whether or not the guarantee has been observed? It seems to me that in this debate the parliamentary duty to preserve the constitution is fundamental.

</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40713-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   That is a matter for our own consciences. How effective were we when we debated the ouster clause in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill? It was changed. It was far more important that that happened than that we did not debate adequately or fully at the time the provenance of these changes.
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I want to finish. Having discussed how this guarantee can be honoured, the ultimate guarantor in parliamentary terms is us, but in terms of government it is the Minister. What kind of cheapskate politics do we anticipate will occur when a Minister with a constitutional duty will ignore his duty? It is difficult to accept that we should approach our constitution in such a way.

</p>

<a name="40713-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Lastly, if the Bill is given its full reforming effect, the Lord Chancellor&#039;s office has come to an end&#151;an honourable end&#151;but the new start is a better start. A combination of constitutional guarantees, roles of the Lord Chief Justice and so on make it better. To continue the role would be to preserve a name. It would be confusing and unhelpful. It would certainly be undemocratic to require such a Minister to be a lawyer and from this House. It would certainly anticipate a lack of calibre that I do not accept in politics: Roy Jenkins, not being a lawyer, presented the first Prevention of Terrorism Bill in the other place with distinction, as many other non-lawyer Ministers have done with complex litigation. Above all, it is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The concordat indicates at paragraph 5 that the new arrangements should reinforce the independence of the judiciary. In the previous debate in this House, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice himself said that the Bill had his firm support in implementing the concordat because it would ensure the continued independence of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is right. This is a dramatic change in constitutional life. But what is the choice? Is it to be a practice vague to discern, dependent upon the strength and personality of a Lord Chancellor to make it effective; and to be effective in circumstances about which we know next to nothing? Or should it be a principle writ large in a constitutional chapter; plain to read; readily understood; and thereby much more enforceable?
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The chapter of our constitution that the Bill represents is an occasion for necessary change. It is an occasion when this House should support this Bill, whether it sadly leads to the end of the Lord Chancellor or not.

I raise it again now, partly because it has just been raised by the noble Lord and partly because the alleged &quot;guarantee of continued judicial independence&quot;&#151;that is the heading to Clause 1&#151;has been placed right at the front of the Bill. The worth of that guarantee should be evaluated and fully understood by noble Lords before they decide that the proposed abolition of the office of Lord Chancellor is to be supported or rejected.

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Another working party of greatly respected Members of this House, chaired by my noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon, whose important memorandum to the Select Committee can be found on page 465 of the evidence volume, drew attention to the attempt made in Clause 1 to impose a statutory duty to protect the independence of the judiciary and commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;We have the strongest doubts about the effectiveness of those provisions. Their existence demonstrates the dangers that arise from these reforms. We do not understand how such duties can be enforced&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40713-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, giving oral evidence in response to my question on the subject (question 527), said that it was not intended that a clause of this sort should be enforced in the courts. He compared it to the declaratory provisions to be found in education and National Health Service legislation and told the committee that a Minister failing to fulfil the responsibilities set out in the clause,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;will be answerable to Parliament and the public for failure to do so&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>With great respect to the Lord Chief Justice, I believe that this clause, which seeks to impose very specific highly important duties, is intended to be of much greater significance than clauses which impose general duties to promote education or to establish a comprehensive health service. And as the Alexander of Weedon working party pointed out in paragraph 61,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;if the proposed statutory duty proves ineffective, it is likely the Lord Chief Justice will be drawn further into political and media controversy in order to defend individual judges&quot;.</p>

<a name="40713-11_para12"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40713-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I suggested that if the clause is extended to cover the rule of law and, even more, if Clause 1 is given enhanced status by imposing an interpretive obligation along the lines of Section 3 of the Human    Rights Act 1998, as proposed by the Judges&#039; Council,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;surely there will be citizens outside who perhaps do not feel that Parliament is doing its job effectively who will want to take the matter to the courts and to judicial review&quot;.</p>

<a name="40713-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>We have got into a sort of circular position because we started with an unenforceable clause, and then we are told that it is okay because Parliament will deal with it; but if Parliament fails to do something about it for the people, the people&#039;s only remedy is to go to the courts.
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para15"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It seems to me wildly unlikely that the clause will be redrafted to make it legally enforceable. The last thing that Ministers want is to be pursued in the courts for their failures. And as Professor Jolowicz argued in his written evidence (page 365), although the clause is a fine example of what he called <i>lex imperfecta</i>, it may not be wise to open the door to an application for judicial review. That, he said,

<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Alexander Weedon working party gets to the heart of the question in paragraph 56, when it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;we consider that the Lord Chancellor presently holds a strong role in protecting the independence of the judiciary within Government . . . First, he acts as their spokesman in arguing for resources to enable them to do their work properly and to ensure that their position is protected. Secondly, he can remind other members of the cabinet of their role within the justice system. As such, he acts as a counter-balance to the equally important role of the Home Secretary in looking after the interests of public security&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Equally telling is the working party&#039;s earlier quotation of Lord Birkenhead&#039;s defence of the office, written in 1922, to be found on page 467 of the evidence volume. It firmly deals with the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that all we are talking about is a name. Lord Chancellor Birkenhead wrote:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;if they are totally severed there will disappear with them any controlling or suggestive force exterior to the Judges themselves, and it is difficult to believe that there is no necessity for the existence of such a personality, imbued on the one hand with legal ideas and habits of thought, and aware on the other of the problems which engage the attention of the executive Government. In the absence of such a person the judiciary and executive are likely enough to drift asunder to the point of violent separation, followed by a still more violent and disastrous collision&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>We live in a moment of history when that warning seems prescient and apposite.
</p>

<a name="40713-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>My final reference is to the Law Lords, who told the Select Committee, as reported at page 116, that they are,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;very greatly concerned that the important constitutional values which the office of Lord Chancellor protected should continue to be effectively protected. In the past the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role was to uphold constitutional propriety and champion judicial independence. The constitution would be gravely weakened if that safeguard were removed and not replaced&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The Prime Minister decided to remove that historic safeguard without consultation and, astonishingly, without reference to the Cabinet&#151;so much for the idea that the Cabinet Secretary is to be the proper defender of the independence of the judiciary. It seems unarguable that an unenforceable declaratory clause cannot be an adequate substitute for the historic role of the Lord Chancellor. Furthermore, the authority and influence of the role does not stem simply from his responsibility for what were described in our report as &quot;judicially related matters&quot;. The special responsibility as the &quot;constitutional conscience&quot; of government, defending judicial independence and the rule of law in Cabinet goes much wider and springs from the historic character and seniority of the office. That must not be casually put on one side, which is why I strongly support the amendment and the other clauses that go with it.

<a name="40713-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I wish to add to the encomiums addressed to my noble friend Lord Richard, the chairman of the Select Committee, who did a brilliant job in guiding us. As some noble Lords will remember, I was opposed to the appointment of the Select Committee on the grounds that the procedure of such a committee was not appropriate. We proved that to be the case. In the first part of our work, we treated the Bill as draft legislation and produced extremely good evidence. If we had stopped there, it would have been very helpful. But we then ignored the procedure in the <i>Companion</i>, decided to take no votes and dealt with amendments to the whole Bill in one day, with the exception of Clause 1, on which there was another short session. Until halfway through the process&#151;the taking of evidence and the report&#151;the procedure was extremely good. However, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1164"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the procedure that we then adopted showed that, if we had followed the procedure that should have applied, the appointment of a Select Committee on a substantive Bill would not have worked at all.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>We have heard a great deal about the historic role of the Lord Chancellor. I understand the history and great dignity of the office. However, let us look at what Lord Chancellors do in practice. They emerge from highly charged political discussions with the Prime Minister and ministerial colleagues involving personalities, issues and policy; they revert to acting as head of the judiciary; they help to draft the party manifesto for the general election; at the same time, they are extremely busy as a departmental Minister with a very large budget and some 20,000 civil servants; then, in their spare time, they serve as the Speaker of the House of Lords.

</p>

<a name="40713-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>We all have our views about what happened on 12 June, but without this Bill, the situation would have continued. We now agree that the Lord Chancellor should not be the head of the judiciary and perhaps should not be the Speaker of the House of Lords in the new role that we are now defining and agreeing. All that would have continued. None of the noble Lords who have tabled amendments proposed to change that situation; it was a complete anomaly, with the role involving a mixture of politician, judge and the other aspects about which we all know. The Bill has put that right; without it there would have been no concordat between the judiciary and the executive for the first time.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I have described the role of the Lord Chancellor. In practice he would not so much need Chinese walls between his various roles as the Great Wall of China. It seems generally agreed that the Lord Chancellor should not sit as a judge and should therefore not be the head of the judiciary. As a non-lawyer&#151;I think that I am the first to speak in this debate&#151;I have always thought it odd that the head of the judiciary need never sit as a judge, would very rarely sit as one and was appointed by the Prime Minister.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Any dispassionate examination of the role of the Lord Chancellor would conclude that the Speaker of this House should no longer be appointed by the Prime Minister but should be elected by the House. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, agrees with that view in an article in today&#039;s <i>Times. </i>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, that is a matter for the House that need not concern us now.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>If the roles of head of the judiciary and the Speakership are removed, it leaves the central question: what should the new role of the Lord Chancellor be? We agree that the Lord Chancellor should at least relinquish his role as head of the judiciary and Speaker of this House. Even if those functions are removed, all the amendments in this group are intended to ensure that there is a senior lawyer and a Member of the House of Lords in the Cabinet to protect the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.

<a name="40713-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I have listened carefully to the arguments in favour of a senior, experienced lawyer; I understand where they come from. If I were a very unkind non-lawyer, I would say that it was special pleading in spades. I was reminded of the famous remark by Jo Grimond on &quot;Any Questions&quot; 30 or more years ago, when there was much discussion of restricted practices in the trade union. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;If you really want to see restricted practices, put on your hat and walk down to the Temple&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>If we were to require that the Lord Chancellor must be a senior experienced lawyer and a Member of the House of Lords, it would be a unique prescription on the power of the Prime Minister in the construction of the Cabinet. Any noble Lord who has spoken has dealt with the point that this House does not control supply. However, those who support the amendment suggest that a senior departmental Minister&#151;I see that there are two former Chancellors of the Exchequer sitting opposite&#151;with a budget of &#163;3 billion should be a Member of this House and not the House that controls supply.

<a name="40713-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may pick up on the noble Lord&#039;s use of the words &quot;unique prescription&quot;. The unique prescription that the Lord Chancellor should be a senior lawyer and a Member of this House has prevailed for 100 or 200 years, but by convention and not by statute. But the unique prescription has been there; Prime Ministers and the nation have managed to live with it quite well.

</p>

<a name="40713-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I conclude on the point of the rule of law. Seven members of the committee either were members of the Cabinet or had attended Cabinet, as I did for five years. We asked if any of us could remember from our time when the rule of law had specifically been discussed as the rule of law in Cabinet. Now, I am sure that there were many discussions with Lord Chancellors on points of law. No one could actually remember the rule of law being discussed as such in Cabinet. The evidence of the Lord Chancellor says it all:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;The rule of law in the questions that we are talking about is not has the Government complied with the law . . . we are talking about big constitutional issues which are identifiable to all members of the Cabinet.

I do not believe it is, I believe that all constitutional politicians can spot them&quot;.</p>

I do so as a member of the working party of Members of your Lordships&#039; House chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, set up on the initiative of the Bar Council to consider the implications of the changes proposed in the Constitutional Reform Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The reason that your Lordships&#039; House took the unusual step of setting up a Select Committee at Second Reading was because we objected to the way in which the reform had been introduced. The Prime Minister&#039;s announcement on 12 June 2003, without consultation and as a kind of add-on to a Cabinet reshuffle, typified the extraordinarily cavalier way in which the Government have embarked on the process of constitutional change, perhaps more appropriately called the unravelling of our constitution.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>It is for that reason that I cannot accept the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, that the rule of law and independence of the judiciary are adequately protected by Parliament. That may have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1167"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been true in the past; I am not confident that it will be in the future. The noble Lord referred to Lord Hailsham. It was Lord Hailsham who warned of the dangers of &quot;elective dictatorship&quot;. That is the permanent danger of a unitary constitution. That is why we should not abandon such defences as we have erected over time, however inadequate such defences may be, against a wilful Prime Minister who has an enormous Commons majority at his back.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I believe, as did our committee, that the Lord Chancellor is an essential counterweight to the supremacy of the executive and particularly to the power of the Home Office in our constitution. There is no need to remind your Lordships that ours is a fused constitution with a balance of powers and not a separation of powers. In this constitutional scheme, the Lord Chancellor is the main link between the legal profession and the government, representing the judges&#039; views to the executive and the executive&#039;s views to the judges. He is thus an important element in the protection of the judiciary and the legal profession from political pressure. Such an office, and such an office holder, would be unnecessary and otiose if we had a formal separation of powers between the executive, legislature and judiciary, as in the United States, for example. That is not what the Government are proposing. There is to be no breach in the sovereignty of Parliament. What is proposed is simply to replace the Lord Chancellor with the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Four essential functions are fulfilled by the Lord Chancellor in our constitutional system, which cannot be replicated by a Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. All these four functions flow not just from the name of the Lord Chancellor, as pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, with all the conventions attached to that name, but to the qualities that inhere in that name, whose connection with the name &quot;Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot; would be purely fortuitous.
</p>

<a name="40713-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The first function is to protect the independence of the judiciary. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, has already quoted words from the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, pointing to the radical difference between the Lord Chancellor who is bound by judicial oath, and who is usually at the end of his political career, and a Minister who is a full-time politician not bound by judicial oath, and who may be a middle-ranking or junior member of the Cabinet with hopes of future promotion. Our own evidence at paragraph 21 adds that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;there is no guarantee that the Minister will be a lawyer and so may lack the understanding of successive Lord Chancellors of the role that the legal system, the judges and the profession play in achieving a balanced constitution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The second function is to protect the self-regulation of the legal profession. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, talked of restrictive practices. Restrictive practices can play a constructive role, if they protect the professional competence and integrity of the profession. The self-regulation of the legal profession ensures that. While the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs is to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1168"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

inherit the Lord Chancellor&#039;s power to improve or amend the ethical rules of the profession, our committee, at paragraph 51, was concerned that someone who is not imbued with legal habits of thought may interfere with the profession&#039;s rules,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;in ways that might assist the Government&#039;s own agenda, but which might be inimical to the wider public interest in the administration of justice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Thirdly, we believe that the Lord Chancellor has an essential part to play in protecting the principle of appointment by merit. That is, he should continue to be responsible for appointing senior judges on the nomination of the Judicial Appointments Commission. As our evidence noted at paragraph 33,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;dangers inherent in [the powers of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs to reject candidates for senior judges proposed by the Commission] could be very much lessened if the Lord Chancellor were to remain the appointing officer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Finally, we believe that the Lord Chancellor is the best person to protect the running of the courts&#151;particularly with respect to the function of listing cases&#151;from executive interference. In our evidence at paragraph 44 we wrote that the administration of the courts,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;should be in the hands of a minister of the appropriate seniority to understand the needs of the judiciary and the position of the staff supporting them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>That is why I strongly support the amendments to enable the Lord Chancellor to retain his essential place in our fused constitution. Whether he continues to be our Speaker is for your Lordships to decide.

The analysis of the situation made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, was, again, a tremendous education in all the different factors that are at stake and it is largely to his arguments that I think we should address ourselves.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>One way of characterising the noble Lord&#039;s speech is to say that he analysed the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in terms of functions and examined the ways in which they would be discharged after the enactment of the statute. He considered that the functions would be at least as well discharged and that therefore there is no case for continuing the post of Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>On these Benches, we may feel inexpert in some of these matters, but we know quite a bit about what it is like to have one&#039;s role dealt with in terms of functions.

debate, it is quite important that we use the words &quot;role&quot; and &quot;function&quot; in a somewhat distinguished way from each other. Indeed, there are functions that a person in the role of Lord Chancellor discharges.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The question concerns what the Lord Chancellorship represents to the heart of our society, which I shall look at under the heading of the separation of powers. This House is essentially a unitary place that brings into the common life of the nation a variety of perspectives. Our daily prayers express the desire for the unity and the knitting together of all estates and persons in this realm. They are an expression of what we seek in a society where different functions can be discharged but in which we actually bring those functions together in a single, deliberative council.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Much as I enjoyed my time in the United States and hugely admired the architecture of its constitution, I am not terribly persuaded&#151;certainly not at present&#151;that the separation of powers guarantees very much. It guarantees that those who wish to exert power resort to all kinds of means in order to bring the other branches of government on their side. Some of the spectacles are not particularly edifying.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>If I have to choose between a vocational understanding of politics and office&#151;that is, the Lord Chancellor has a role to which he or she is called&#151;and one that rests on keeping things separate, I would have more faith in the vocational understanding. It seems to provide something to which a person who holds such an office can be, and historically has been, held to account. I do not really trust the possibility that that will simply happen by the interplay of different branches of government.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The separation of powers idea, which I have no doubt lies at the root of these proposals&#151;apart from the changes of detail which, for the most part, are excellent&#151;does not offer what is claimed for it, as well as not being the experience of the constitution of our society. Therefore, for that reason alone, I think that we are going down the wrong track. I feel confirmed in that view by the context in which this discussion is taking place.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I could imagine this House having had this debate before the famous 12 June 2003 and before the debate on the asylum Bill ouster clause. Perhaps, if we had had that debate in a more abstract and calmer frame, I should have been more likely to be persuaded of the course of action on which the Government are embarked. But I cannot state too strongly the undermining of confidence that both those episodes created in me, and I am not alone.

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The 12 June episode underlines the fact that we do not seem to have any operative conventions about how the fragile, nuanced, unwritten constitution of our society evolves and changes. It seems to me that if it can be changed by simply a fiat or announcement, that is very serious because it says that we have not expressed the conventions to ourselves clearly enough. If we have not, we are in considerable danger. That is confirmed by repeated statements made in this debate <br>&nbsp;<br>

that we cannot go back to before 12 June. It tells us that if an announcement of that kind is made, we have no choice but to accept that we go along with it.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>With great respect to the riposte made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, as regards the asylum Bill ouster clause, it is not my recollection of that event that it was this House&#039;s debate that caused the clause to be changed. We came to the debate with an announcement that the clause would be changed. I think that was because of the intervention of some notable persons who, as it happens, but not just as it happens, had held the office of Lord Chancellor.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40713-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for giving way. First, does not the row over the ouster clause show that one cannot necessarily rely on someone who holds the office of Lord Chancellor? Secondly, if this Bill goes through, the Lord Chief Justice would be in a much stronger position as the head of the judiciary in England and Wales. It is he who would be in the best position, rather than the Lord Chancellor, to act as the defender of these rights.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40713-13_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   I appreciate the noble Lord&#039;s intervention. With all due respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, although he is of course the holder of the office of Lord Chancellor, he is the holder of that office post-12 June. That makes a profound difference to how his interventions can be regarded. The powers given to the Lord Chief Justice are very important. But what concerns me most about the ouster clause is that it was ever proposed. That is the serious matter to which I draw attention.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>My final point relates to the process of this discussion. We need some conventions about how our constitution is to be changed. Although I know that many noble Lords will disagree, I think that it is very strange that the Government should make an announcement; that they should not present it to the elected representatives of the people for the first expression of their will; and that they should then process it through this House. I realise that the Committee brings formidable expertise to the task of scrutinising and revising a Bill which emerges from another place. That is how it is supposed to work. It is not going to be able to work in quite that way because the Bill will go from here to another place and we shall not have the kind of scrutiny functions to deploy as regards any amendments made there.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>It is because of the fundamental questions of substance, the processes by which we are dealing with them and the context in which we have been placed, that at the moment I am persuaded to support the amendments.

</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40713-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   I shall be very brief. I sought to make the point that paragraph 35 of the report states &quot;in some way&quot; the office must be retained.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The other point I want to make relates to the speeches of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and my noble friend Lord Kingsland, which concern functions. It arises because of the recommendation at paragraph 45 of the report, which makes it relevant to this amendment to consider whether the scope of the retained functions justifies retention of the office.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>On the basis on which this was dealt with by the noble and learned Lord, the scope is wholly sufficient to justify retention of the office. That is particularly so if one adds to those functions the prime importance of the constitutional role, which has been dealt with by other Members of the Committee, the retention of the Great Seal, which confers authority, and the exercise of the parliamentary role spoken to by noble and learned Lords, including the Speakership, which stands as the guarantee for self-regulation undertaken according to our extant regime. There appears no reason or justification for change, and no one elected or appointed would have the same authority as the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The other matter is that the office was established before the Conquest and the keepership of the Great Seal was conferred, I believe, when the king was otherwise engaged during the 30 Years&#039; War. That seal is kept in the Purse of the Lord Chancellor at the State Opening of Parliament with the gracious Speech. Is it the idea that Clause 12 is to abolish that ceremony which takes place in your Lordships&#039; House, with the Lord Chancellor attendant on the sovereign?
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>On two occasions this great office has been abolished by decree&#151;by Cromwell pending the restoration of the monarchy, and by the Prime Minister today pending immediate restoration to enable this House to sit.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The circumstances of that occasion are all well known to Members of the Committee now and have been aptly described by my noble friend Lord Kingsland on another occasion. Those circumstances cannot yet again justify abolition. As regards the interest of the body politic from the speeches which Members of the Committee have heard, do not those circumstances cry out for the retention of the office? It is accepted by all Members of the Committee to whom I have referred, and I totally agree, that there must and shall be substantive reforms. Reforms, yes, but not abolition.
</p>

<a name="40713-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>At all events, the Great Seal has to be retained in order to confer proximity with the monarch and the precedents, rank and status which is required to discharge the functions to which I have referred. Members of the Committee may remember the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, of checks and balances as to the use of power. It is reminiscent of Darwin&#039;s Mathematical Bridge over the Cam by Queens&#039;, which held itself up by the forces of gravity. Once dismantled, no one could put it together again.

<a name="40713-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I wish to give a short piece of evidence to the Committee. I am one of the few Members of this House who has served in a government in which rule-of-law questions came up frequently in Cabinet. The conduct of Ministers at the time persuaded me that the present system was not quite as perfect as suggested by those with a conservative disposition.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I had the privilege of serving in the second Wilson government&#151;

</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40713-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I was coming to that. It was a government who contained, among others, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, as a distinguished Minister. I served as Roy Jenkins&#039;s special adviser. In that capacity I was given responsibility for looking at the constitutional issues as they came before the Wilson Cabinet. I was a great admirer of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and of the Attorney-General, Sam Silkin. As I travelled back from Morocco I said to Elwyn Jones, on the eve of the Labour government&#039;s election, &quot;What would you do if you were Lord Chancellor?&quot;. I remember that charming, genial and fine lawyer saying, &quot;I would not be the last Lord Chancellor&quot;. I said, &quot;Apart from that, Elwyn, what else would you do?&quot;. It was not clear to me that he had a clear idea. He served with great geniality.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The issues which arose in that Cabinet included what should be done about the Shrewsbury pickets. What should be done about the Clay Cross councillors? What should be done about the fact that the Scottish devolution proposals made no allowance at all for judicial review which, as contemplated at the time, would have given the judges no proper autonomy or power?
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I have to say that, time and time again in Cabinet, the person who stood up for the rule of law was not the Lord Chancellor. It was not even the Attorney-General when he was allowed to be there. It was Roy Jenkins. I do not say that because I believe that a lay person who is not a lawyer would necessarily have the qualities of Roy Jenkins any more than would a lawyer. But I do say from my own observations of Cabinet proceedings&#151;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, will agree that I am not in breach of the Official Secrets Act in saying this after more than 30 years&#151;that it is an innocent illusion to suppose that <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the label of &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot; or the office of Lord Chancellor matters. As the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, said so effectively, what matters is the structure within which the senior office holder operates, the individual personality of that office holder, and whether he or she is a person of strong and robust independence, integrity and understanding of the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>All I can say from my personal experience is that to carry on romanticising about 1,000 years of history and so forth is beside the point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40713-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   I listened with rapt attention and considerable admiration to the opening of this debate by my noble friend Lord Kingsland. I listened with similar respect and attention to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. However, I wonder whether their generosity had not led them to forget rather too soon the events which preceded 12 June. Those events sowed some widespread seeds of deep mistrust both of the Government and of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor himself. I must briefly remind noble Lords of why that was so.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>In my view, since they came into office the Government have handled your Lordships&#039; House in a thoroughly hamfisted way. They were cavalier in their dismissal of a promise which persuaded hereditary Peers to agree to depart from the House on the basis that a reasonable settlement would be made before anything further was done. As far as I can recall, the noble and learned Lord who now sits on the Woolsack dismissed it in a rather lighthearted manner by saying that it was a temporary arrangement which no one could really expect to last. But that was a very different standpoint from that adopted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, whose name, surprisingly, has not been mentioned in the debate so far. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, considered that a promise was a promise, and so he stood in the way of the Government.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>My other charge against the Government is that they have been singularly na-ve in their attempt to wrap all this up in the garments of respectability, saying that it is a well thought out plan of constitutional reform. I do not really think that it was anything of the kind. Moreover, a shock was administered to the Government when they found that neither the Prime Minister nor the noble and learned Lord himself could wave a wand and cause his office to disappear. To get out of the situation created by the honourable conduct of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, the Government called back the Lord Chancellor from the Dome&#151;where, incidentally, he was winning very few laurels&#151;because he had just those qualifications for the job of the present post that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, lacked. The obedience and flexibility of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor commended him to the Prime Minister.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I question the idea that a Secretary of State would be able to resist the pressures of the Home Office. As I said the other day, although the noble and learned <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord did not take my words seriously, I believe that he and his department would make a very easy meal for the Home Secretary.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I cannot forget the cavalier treatment of a certain binding promise which was made. The noble and learned Lord affected to treat it as if it was time-expired.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>We have now had the experience of seeing the noble and learned Lord sitting happily on the Woolsack, still determined, at the end of his term, to destroy the office. I agree with what was said about this by my noble and learned friend Lord Howe. He expressed surprise that the noble and learned Lord, having enjoyed the office, could so easily then destroy it. If the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was right in what he said&#151;that we are simply arguing about the name and title of the office&#151;I cannot see why the Government should not accept that.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I do not think that the noble and learned Lord can be all that surprised at the chilly reception given to this Bill and which, indeed, has been accorded to him for his part in it. He is perhaps the first holder of his office who has thoroughly enjoyed eating his cake, and now relishes destroying it.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>As I have said, I find it quite impossible to dismiss from my mind all the events which preceded 12 June. My one fear is that, when the Bill goes back to the House of Commons, the calm attitude and reasoned compromise displayed by my noble friend Lord Kingsland and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, will not in any way be echoed by the Members and Ministers who sit in that House. I do not share the hopes expressed by my noble friend and I am very sorry for it.

<a name="40713-14_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   Having spent a modest 15 years in this House listening to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, and 10 years in the other place listening to him, I have always been struck by the thought that beneath that curmudgeonly exterior, of which the noble Lord is very proud, there is a very gentle man; indeed, a humorist trying to get out. It is a great pity that he spoils it by being overly acid. It is like putting too much vinegar in the stew. You end up tasting only the vinegar and not tasting the meat. I have to say to him, in all candour and in great friendship, that the speech he has just made was frankly disgraceful in the context of this debate.

</p>

<a name="40713-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Perhaps I may try to bring this down to reality. We have been up in the realms of the constitutional stratosphere. Everybody has been telling me what a great office the Lord Chancellor is, as are the duties he performs, and how the constitution will be, if not destroyed, at least rocked if the Lord Chancellor goes.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Let us look at the alternatives. In our report we set out four possible ways in which, if one wanted to preserve the office of Lord Chancellor, it could be preserved. First, we could retain, preserve and enhance several crucial features of the office, including that he has to be a senior lawyer and a Member of this House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1175"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Secondly, the office of Lord Chancellor could be redefined so that the office became more a judicial than a political one, and legal aid could be transferred to other departments. Indeed, that was the argument put by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Thirdly, the title Lord Chancellor could be used for the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. In other words, there is the Secretary State, and the person who is performing that function does what the Bill requires of him, but he is called the Lord Chancellor. That, as I understand it, has been the position taken up by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Fourthly, the title Lord Chancellor could be used for the Speaker of the House, and indeed that is what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, seems to be advocating. One noble Lord who gave evidence to us said that the Lord Chancellor was Speaker of the House and, when asked what else he could do, said that he could &quot;hold himself at the disposal of the House&quot;. I was not quite sure what that meant at the time, nor indeed am I sure now.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>It is therefore important to start this argument by looking at the four main elements of what the Lord Chancellor is supposed to do and to ask ourselves is he doing them, in this day and age should he be doing them, or should they be done in some other way?
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>What are they? First, he is the senior judge in the United Kingdom, recognised as such as head of the   judiciary. Secondly, he is responsible for the administration of the courts, legal aid, and some other administrative matters. Thirdly, he appoints the judges. Fourthly, he sits as Speaker of the Lords.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Let us look at each of them. First, it seems to me to be absolutely basic that if he cannot sit as a judge he cannot sit as head of the judiciary. We heard very strong evidence that it is not possible at the moment for the Lord Chancellor to sit. Reference was made in parenthesis by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, told us about the efforts made to try to find work for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, to do.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I  will read to the House what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham said.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;In the three years until Lord Irvine retired when I was here he sat on two cases. It was agreed between us that he could not do anything with crime because that affected his colleague, the Home Secretary, he could not deal with human rights because he had piloted that Bill through the House, he could not deal with judicial review because it was of government interest and he could not deal with commercial cases because they always went on for much longer than he could possibly sit. That left him in that period of three years with two cases, one about whether premises could be a dwelling for the purposes of the Rent Act if they did not have a kitchen and one about the construction of a mortgage deed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The conclusion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, was quite firm:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;This was the result of both of us trying to find cases on which he could sit. I came to form the view that really no useful purpose was served&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>That seems to me to explode the idea that the Lord Chancellor should continue to be a judge or be regarded as head of the judiciary; and, if he is not going <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1176"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to be the head of the judiciary, who is? The answer to that is the Lord Chief Justice. The question that then has to be asked is whether he is in a better position to safeguard the independence of the judiciary than is      the Lord Chancellor&#151;this emasculated Lord Chancellor&#151;who is no longer a judge and no longer head of the judiciary itself.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>It seems to me that the one thing the concordat does&#151;and I very much agree with what my noble friend Lord Brennan said on this&#151;is to establish a firm relationship, as far as I know for the first time in British constitutional history, between the judges and the executive. That is a much greater protection for the judges than they have ever had in the past, other than merely relying upon the efforts, unseen, of a Lord Chancellor. Therefore, that first function of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s office goes.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Secondly, he is the Minister now responsible for the administration of the courts and legal aid. Noble Lords may not like this, but the change in the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department over the last 10 or 15 years has been dramatic. It is bound to cause changes in the role of the Lord Chancellor and in the office that any possible Lord Chancellor may occupy.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>What is it? He now administers a budget of &#163;3  billion a year. The manpower of the department is now 23,000 and will soon be 30,000-strong. If one were approached, objectively and cold, and asked, &quot;My department has a budget of &#163;3 billion and employs 30,000 staff. Where should the Minister sit?&quot;, the automatic reaction of anyone who has been connected with politics would be, &quot;Down the other end&quot;. I am not saying that the Lord Chancellor has to sit down the other end, but I am saying that you cannot rule it out. For a senior Secretary of State of a major spending department of that sort, under our constitution, supply is determined down the other end of the corridor, not up here. It seems to me that a situation in which he was sitting up here and there was a junior answering for him on matters in the House of Commons would not be satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>If those responsibilities are removed from the Lord Chancellor&#039;s brief, which is the suggestion, and they go to a Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor does other things, what is left? At the moment, judicial appointments are very much within the discretion of the Lord Chancellor. The existing process is arcane and shrouded. In recent years, since 1945, there has been very little criticism of the process on political grounds. By and large, judges are no longer appointed because of their political allegiances. It was not always so. Those attached to the 1,000 year-old institution, its mystique and its tradition, should perhaps recognise this.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>There is a famous story told of Lord Halsbury when he was Lord Chancellor. There was a vacancy in the High Court and someone approached him and said, &quot;Lord Chancellor, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, you will of course appoint the best man for the job&quot;, to which he said, &quot;<i>Ceteris paribus</i> be damned! I shall appoint my nephew&quot;&#151;and he did.

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The history of Lord Chancellors until the end of the Second World War is not the mystical one that we have heard about today&#151;as the guardian of the constitution, the guardian of the rule of law. All too often, Lord Chancellors of the past have not been interpreting the views of judges to the Cabinet. What they have been doing is taking the views of the Cabinet and enforcing them on the judges and on the judiciary. By and large, the process has been in the opposite direction to that which noble Lords opposite seem to think.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I come back to the point I made a little earlier. In terms of the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, the concordat is a greater safeguard than the existing position of the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-14_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The consensus on the Committee, and I think now generally, is that the time has come to establish a Judicial Appointments Commission. That proposal may need fine-tuning, but I think that the Government&#039;s approach is inescapable and right.

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Finally, there is the fourth function of the Lord Chancellor&#151;sitting on the Woolsack as the Speaker of this House. I ask those who support the office of Lord Chancellor on the basis of the 1,000 years of history, tradition and greatness behind him, do they really think that the office should be so diminished as to be confined to somebody who sits on the Woolsack of the House of Lords for two hours a day when the House is sitting and, indeed, when the House is self-regulating? Is that what it comes down to? With great respect, we are arguing about a name and shell. We are not arguing about a post. We are not arguing about anything particularly concrete. We are arguing about whether, after 1,000 years of history, we take this terribly dramatic step of removing the name &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot; from the British constitution.

<a name="40713-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   Perhaps I may finish this sentence and then I shall of course give way. The noble Lord having risen, perhaps I should say that the name and the Great Seal will be left. I had forgotten the Great Seal.

<a name="40713-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   The noble Lord referred to &quot;name and shell&quot;; what about the Monarch and the State Opening of Parliament? It is not a name and a shell.

<a name="40713-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   I am very much attached to the State Opening of Parliament. I enjoy it; it is colourful. It gives great fun and enjoyment to all those concerned. However, it does not have to be the Lord Chancellor who goes down on his knee and hands up the Queen&#039;s Speech. I am sure that anyone who sits on the Woolsack at any given moment could do that. Indeed, even perhaps one of the other Ministers in the House <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1178"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of Lords could do that. I do not think that the nature of the ceremony of the opening of Parliament is a justification, one way or another, for retaining the Lord Chancellor.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="40713-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. In order that there should be no misunderstanding, when I introduced the amendment I made it absolutely clear that we accept the new architecture of the Bill. The issue is not whether the Lord Chancellor should or should not remain in status quo; the issue is whether in the new architecture of the Bill, the Lord Chancellor should fulfil the function of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. To say other is to misrepresent our position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40713-15_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   It is not your position; there is not one position on the matter. That is the unreality of the debate. Everyone is saying they want to retain the Lord Chancellor, but there are different versions of the kind of Lord Chancellor they want to retain. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is clear and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, is clear&#151;but the two certainly do not agree. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, if he was in his place, would not agree.

</p>

<a name="40713-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Before people attack the Bill in a slightly virulent way, it is incumbent upon the Opposition to say what kind of Lord Chancellor they want. I have heard it from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and, with respect, I do not need to hear it again. I heard it in Committee; I have heard it twice today; I understand it.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Perhaps I may now briefly finish what I was going to say. The only argument that seems to me to be left for some individual called the Lord Chancellor is that he should be a kind of constitutional nanny in the Cabinet, where he could pass on to the rest of the Cabinet and the Government his preoccupations about whether the Government are doing something which interferes with the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. History does not lead us to believe that the function of many Lord Chancellors in the past has been in that direction. As I said earlier, too often it has been in the other direction.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>If the post goes and there is very little left of it except the name and shell, should we keep the name? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, was quoted earlier and perhaps I may be allowed to quote him. He was very firm that continued use of the title would create confusion. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;because of an accumulation of events, including the fact that the role of the Government Minister envisaged in the Concordat is very different from the historic role of the Lord Chancellor, I have real reservations as to whether it is possible to retain the title&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Change is inevitable. The only real question now is how does one effect it. It seems to me that the time has come for this particular bullet to be bitten.

<a name="40713-15_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I detect that the feeling of the House is reaching the stage of wishing to hear from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and then bringing the matter to a conclusion. But perhaps, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1179"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

someone whose name is attached to the amendments, I may be allowed to postpone that for one&#151;but only one&#151;speech further.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The first thing I was going to say has just been said in the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. After hearing the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Brennan, Lord Carter and Lord Richard, and the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to the right reverend Prelate, one would have thought that none of them had heard the various concessions and points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, at the beginning as to what these amendments do not seek to change. It is no good noble Lords on the Government Benches knocking down cock-shies that do not exist.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Richard, said that there are various models of Lord Chancellor that might be kept. That may be so, but the model we are debating is the one contained in these amendments&#151;and it is quite clear what that model does and does not seek to do. Under the government proposals in the Bill, there is a substantial role for a Government Minister. Obviously that is right; there has to be a considerable ministerial involvement in processes such as being responsible for the courts and judicial resources and the administration of those services; being responsible for setting up the Judicial Appointments Commission and recommending judicial appointments on its selection; and for implementing the concordat.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Various people have spoken about the concordat but have forgotten&#151;or perhaps some have not read every word of Schedule 1 and so have not known&#151;what it actually involves. The concordat involves an enormous number of decisions, made either by the Lord Chief Justice in concurrence with the Minister, or by the Minister in concurrence with the Lord Chief Justice, or by one having consulted the other. There is a very large ministerial role. The question is: who is to perform it?
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, quite rightly said that under the Bill the Lord Chief Justice is to represent the views of the judges. But the noble Lord seems to have forgotten that under the Bill also the Lord Chief Justice will be deprived of his voice in this place and will not be able to comment in advance, or speak in Cabinet or to Ministers, about proposals that have not yet emerged. We all know that the word that gets out early and prevents someone announcing a detrimental course of action is infinitely more influential; it is easier than trying to turn someone from a policy that they have announced.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Under Clause 1, the Minister will have a special responsibility for guarding judicial independence and the rule of law. That is a role which inherently involves tension. There is inevitably and rightly a conflict between the demands of order and efficiency and the demands of justice and the rule of law. Those whose duty it is to protect the latter&#151;the demands of justice and the rule of law&#151;must be willing and able to stand up for their cause notwithstanding that inherent tension.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The Government say that one of the purposes of their proposals is to remove that inherent tension. If that is what the effect of the Bill will be, then the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1180"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

defence of constitutional propriety will have gone by the board. If the tension is not there, the role is not being fulfilled.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The question before the House is not one of name or how you preserve the Lord Chancellor. We do not start from the premise, &quot;Oh, we must have a Lord Chancellor doing something; now let&#039;s find him something to do&quot;, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, seems to think. We are saying&#151;to use the words of the right reverend Prelate&#151;that there are functions under this Bill; what kind of person do you want to discharge them?
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The Government say that we are to have an ordinary, run-of-the-mill House of Commons politician in the middle of his career looking for promotion, with no particular knowledge of the law and its workings, hoping to keep the Prime Minister&#039;s good will and get promotion and move upwards, sideways or perhaps, if he is difficult, outwards, in a very short time.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Contrariwise, we say that there should be somebody in the traditional mould of a Lord Chancellor who has served the British constitution in an evolving way for many centuries. It should be a senior lawyer in this House, bound by an oath to the duties imposed on him by Clause 1. It should be somebody&#151;and this is the key perhaps&#151;at the ceiling of his career, who has nothing to hope for by way of promotion and who therefore is in a stronger&#151;I only say stronger&#151;position.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, said that it is surprising that we are seeking to encapsulate that in the statute. It has been the practice and convention for centuries. The only reason why it has to be encapsulated in statute now is because the Government have sought to tear up that convention.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The advantages of having such a person are that he is in a much better&#151;I only say better&#151;position to fulfil the vital role of protecting the rule of law and judicial independence. What is fascinating is that that is a view expressed by the House of Commons constitutional committee. Surely, therefore, it is not very surprising if your Lordships&#039; House takes the same view. Such a person is more likely to see the rule-of-law implications, and is in a better position to insist on them.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Of course that person can be sacked. Any Minister can be sacked. But that is a very drastic tack for a Prime Minister to take. Everyone will be aware that he has been sacked, and he will be around to make his displeasure or his reasons for dissenting known, whereas an ordinary Minister can be moved with no trouble without ruffling the waters. He can be &quot;promoted&quot; or moved sideways. Nobody will know that that is because he was putting his foot down or seeking to say, &quot;Oi, look, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are offended by your proposal&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>We are not saying that a Lord Chancellor will always succeed in standing up for the rule of law sufficiently strongly, or that he will succeed. No mechanism in a constitution&#151;certainly no mechanism <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1181"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1181</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

depending on a person&#151;will always be successful. But we are saying that on average he will be more likely to be successful in that role than a run-of-the-mill politician hoping for promotion. It does not avail us for the noble Lord, Lord Lester, to tell us how wonderfully Lord Jenkins no doubt would have done that job, or for the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to tell us how wonderfully the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, would have done that job. Of course there are always exceptions. But what we are looking for is what in general will be better. I would suggest that there is no doubt that that is somebody in the mould and with the qualifications of a judicial Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I entirely agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester that it is totally defeatist to suggest that, because the Government have sought to smash the mould, that mould is irretrievable. There have always been bad holders of particular offices, or periods when offices did not do particularly well, but that does not mean that those offices were ruined. That is no more the case now.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>There is one other point which I do not think has been made. If there is a person with the qualifications of a Lord Chancellor, it will be infinitely easier for the partnership between the Lord Chief Justice and the Government to function properly, and for them to handle judiciary-related matters. There are hundreds of different matters in Schedule 1 alone. If there is a new Minister from outside with no relevant background, and the Lord Chief Justice has to get his concurrence or consult him or vice versa on myriad issues, the Lord Chief Justice&#151;poor man&#151;will spend the first six months of that man&#039;s time in office teaching him the basics of what is going on. He will have to explain to him who the difficult personalities are, and explain the problems. Just when they are beginning to talk the same language, he will be moved on to another department, whereas Lord Chancellors have on the whole been relatively permanent, certainly by the relevant standards.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>That raises a very important point on which the noble and learned Lords, Lord Bingham and Lord Mackay, expressed great concern. It is on whether, if under the Bill an enormous amount of administrative work is loaded on to the Lord Chief Justice, top lawyers and the best judges will want to take that role if they have those administrative burdens made infinitely more difficult by having to deal with a series of new Ministers coming in and having to be taught.
</p>

<a name="40713-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>It is said that one does not have a doctor as Minister of Health, or a soldier as Minister of Defence, so why does one need a special qualification for this role? The answer is another question: is the administration of justice simply a department of government, or is it a separate and vital strand of our constitution? As the very distinguished working party chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, and including Members from all parts of the House, made absolutely plain, the administration of justice is different and therefore cannot be equated with the Minister of Health.

<a name="40713-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I sought to explain why there are enormous advantages to the course proposed by the amendment. Are there any disadvantages? I can see only one, but I fear that it will weigh with the Government&#039;s Front Bench very strongly. It is that the proposed amendment is not the scheme devised by the Prime Minister on the back of an envelope after long minutes of thought, research and consultation during the afternoon of 12 June.

<a name="40713-16_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   This afternoon we have had a debate which has consisted mostly of speeches by legal and noble and learned Lords. Some of them have been learned and some are just legal, but most of them have fallen into that category. I do not fall into either category.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I have listened with a certain degree of surprise to what has been said. We have heard everyone saying what a Lord Chancellor should do, what the independence of the judiciary means, how it ought to be achieved, what the lawyers ought to do and how justice can be properly performed in this country. I listened to this with amazement because I had never thought that we had done this before. We had a Lord Chancellor for a thousand years; they may have all been different, years and years ago, but recently we have looked back on them with admiration and have thought that they conducted their work well. It is surprising that one then has people saying, &quot;We ought to adjust this and adjust that&quot;, as if we were trying to devise a system for a new country that was starting up.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>When a government come along with the intention of disposing of the office of Lord Chancellor, frankly, I wince in a great way. What was the first reaction of your Lordships&#039; House? It was, &quot;What are we going to do without a Lord Chancellor? We will have to have a Speaker&quot;. So, like all good authoritative bodies, we set up a committee to find out what kind of Speaker we should have. It was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and it was decided that we would have to have a Speaker and pay him &#163;100,000 a year. Then, surprise of all surprises, we will have to find something for him to do.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>It never occurred to us to consider such things when we had a noble and learned Lord sitting on the Woolsack. He fitted in all the responsibilities that he was given. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, said that his office has increased enormously. I daresay that it has; so has the Prime Minister&#039;s office. In some people&#039;s minds the Prime Minister seems to manage all right with his greatly inflated office and I have no doubt that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor can too. However, that is not an argument for doing away with that which we have had and that which has been run well.

</p>

<a name="40713-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Other countries do not have a Lord Chancellor and people come to this country to see what we do and how we do it. I spoke to someone from South Africa the other day. He said, &quot;We are engaged in building a new <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1183</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

country and are trying to find out what to do. We come to your country and what do we find? You abolish everything and do away with it all&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I am not at all impressed by the idea of having a Speaker in your Lordships&#039; House. We had one in the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and despite being able to ridicule that, it worked well. However, we will obviously have to do something if this office is abolished.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>No noble Lord has yet referred today to what the Government are doing to the constitution. They are going around rather like Boadicea in her chariot chopping off everything that they can, particularly in your Lordships&#039; House. First, they did away with hereditary Peers. Then they said that they must have 100 of them back, so 100 came back. Just for the sake of embarrassment, I remind your Lordships that we are the only Peers who are elected&#151;none of the others is. Then they said, &quot;Now we will do away with the Law Lords&quot;&#151;vaporise them&#151;so the Law Lords went. Then the Lord Chancellor came along and said, &quot;I want the Lord Chancellor&#039;s head off&quot;&#151;which used to be treason, but I suppose that it is not nowadays.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>When we have got rid of the hereditary Peers, the Law Lords and the Lord Chancellor, what is left but the life Peers. Let nobody think that they will not be the next to go. Of course they will. We cannot have a House made up of a lot of life Peers packed in by the Government. We have recently seen and are continuing to see new Peers admitted day after day and good luck to them. We welcome them broadly. However, let us not pretend that that is the right way to fill a Second Chamber, when all the other participating bits have been removed.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I suppose that even the right reverend Prelates&#039; chances are numbered. Certainly, their numbers are numbered. That is a great pity because the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester made a significant contribution when he asked why anything should be sacrosanct about 12 June 2003 just because the Prime Minister, however important he is, makes a judgment. That does not mean to say that nobody can then go down that path afterwards.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>What the Government are doing to the constitution is of tremendous effect. They are wrong and it is wrong to encourage the Government to destroy the constitution, even if it means that there should be some way of changing slightly the work or the duties of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. He ought to stay in his place as it is.

<a name="40713-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   May I join other noble Lords and express my gratitude to the work done by my noble friend Lord Richard for successfully chairing the Select Committee? The committee made real progress in improving the Bill. In two significant areas we failed to reach agreement&#151;the future of the Lord Chancellor, and the Supreme Court. Even in those areas we heard evidence which illuminated our discussions. We are not nearly so far apart in our views as this debate might suggest.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1184"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I am glad that we had the Select Committee. I opposed it at the time, fearful that the most recent precedent prior to this Select Committee would be followed and the Bill would be killed. That has not happened. As my noble friend Lord Carter said, it has allowed for something akin to pre-legislative scrutiny in the course of the Bill going through Parliament. It has allowed the pace of reform to be more deliberate, so that proper consideration has been given to the principles and the details. That is to the good. The circumstances surrounding the birth of these proposals have led to them being attended by suspicion. They deserve to be considered on their merits. The Select Committee has given us time to do that. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, there has been an emerging degree of agreement on what he described as the architecture of the new arrangements.

</p>

<a name="40713-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The role of the Lord Chancellor as it has developed over the past century until the beginning of the 1970s has the following elements. He is: the Speaker of this House; a judge; the head of the judiciary appointing, deploying and disciplining judges; the voice of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary within government; and the head of a major government department responsible for the courts, legal aid and a number of other constitutional policy responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>Until the 1970s, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said in evidence to us, the predominant aspects of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s job and day were as judge and head of the judiciary, and Speaker of the House of Lords&#151;the morning in the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords and the afternoon on the Woolsack. His ministerial responsibilities were not onerous. Indeed, in 1885, the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Office comprised only a Permanent Secretary and seven other officials, the vast majority of whom were lawyers. Following the Courts Act 1971, his office grew to 10,000 staff, with a budget to match. As has been stated often in the course of this debate and in Select Committee, that budget now stands at over &#163;3 billion, over half of which is devoted to legal aid.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The expenditure of such large sums has increasingly become, quite legitimately, the object of political controversy. Questions are rightly asked about how well criminal courts handle the management of criminal cases, how the legal aid budget should be spent and how quickly and fairly the magistrates&#039; courts deal with public law children cases. The regulation of the legal profession is a matter of legitimate political debate and there are questions about the extent to which the vulnerable and the socially excluded have proper access to advice and justice. Those are matters of political debate throughout the country.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The increase in both the size of the ministerial function and the political attention that it has attracted have been accompanied, although for different reasons, by a reduction of two other parts of his responsibilities&#151;those of Speaker of this House <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1185"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and those of sitting as a judge. Since Lord Hailsham&#039;s tenure, the Lord Chancellor has had to be supported by a significant number of Deputy Speakers with whom to share the workload of the Woolsack. Although it is ultimately a matter for your Lordships&#039; House to decide, the continuing role as Speaker is uneasy and difficult to reconcile with the changing demands of the office. By that, I do not refer to the burden of work, but to the nature of the work. A significant ministerial job is not easy to reconcile with being the Speaker of this House. As your Lordships have heard, the sittings of the Lord Chancellor as a member of the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#039; House have become fewer and fewer. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, made clear in the extract of his evidence read by my noble friend Lord Richard, it has become increasingly difficult to find cases in which the Lord Chancellor can participate.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Practical difficulties aside, it has appeared increasingly inappropriate for the Lord Chancellor to sit judicially. There is now little if any support for that role. The Select Committee&#039;s first area of broad agreement was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;that it has long been impracticable for the Lord Chancellor to sit as a judge&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>At the same time, the Lord Chancellor&#039;s workload in other areas has increased, but in respect of significant responsibilities of his role as head of the judiciary&#151;the appointment, deployment and disciplining of judges&#151;there is a growing sense that the time for significant change has arrived. As Committee members have been told in the course of this debate, members of the Select Committee were unanimous that the time had come to set up a Judicial Appointments Commission. It is neither sensible nor defensible to leave the appointment of judges to one person.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Whereas 50 years ago, he would be making about 25 appointments a year from a pool of barristers who would be largely known to him personally, now he makes over 700 appointments. The majority of those are not from the Bar but from a pool that is substantially unknown to him.

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>There is also acceptance of the need for the explicit involvement of the executive, albeit constrained, in the appointment system. The concordat negotiated with the judiciary, of which we have heard much in the debate, and for which there is considerable support, represents the view of the executive and the judiciary about what their relationship should be. It is possible to have different views about the precise involvement, but it is important to point out that the concordat envisages that the Minister fulfilling the role of the appointer&#151;or the giver of advice&#151;under the concordat is no longer either the head of the judiciary or a judge. There is acceptance that the role of the Lord Chancellor as a judge and head of the judiciary has gone.

<a name="40713-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>On the matter of discipline, change has already occurred. Both my predecessor and I have regarded it as wholly inappropriate to consider disciplining a judge without consulting the Lord Chief Justice. In relation to any serious step against a judge, we would seek his concurrence. A protocol to that effect already existed between us. The concordat sets out in detail how the discipline process would work in the future. Again the role envisaged by the Minister in the concordat is not that of a judge but a Minister.

</p>

<a name="40713-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Finally, in respect of deployment, the judiciary and I agree that, both as a matter of practicability and constitutional principle, it is wholly wrong for the Lord Chancellor to determine which individual judge should sit in which court. That is patently a matter for the judges. The view of the vast majority of those who gave evidence was that the time had come for the Lord Chancellor to cease to be the head of the judiciary. Instead, the Lord Chief Justice&#151;the chief professional judge in England and Wales&#151;should take that role.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>There remains the Lord Chancellor&#039;s function as the person in government who protects the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. This is a critical function. It must and will be preserved. It is the expression of key values on which our constitution rests: justice, the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, aside from party politics. That role goes beyond the mere identification of the law and the need to adhere to it. It goes further than simply ensuring that the Government take proper legal advice before doing something.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>In the context of a democracy, which is based on parliamentary sovereignty, it involves speaking out privately, and if necessary publicly, where the rule of law may be threatened. But the role is as part of government, not separate. It involves speaking for justice, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary within the Cabinet and the Government. It is one aspect of a number of protections that exist. The Attorney-General, the courts, the police and lawyers all have a role. But the Minister, given his responsibilities for the justice system and the judiciary, has an important role to play.
</p>

<a name="40713-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The holder of the office needs to be a respected and trusted member of the Government, able to put the requirements of justice and the rule of law above daily considerations. The role&#151;critical in our constitution&#151;must be performed by someone who is no longer a judge. The effect of our deliberations in the Select Committee, and as we believed the position to be before that committee, was that the role of judge and head of judiciary had effectively gone. A judge in Cabinet, increasingly perceived to be outside the mainstream by his colleagues and the public, will not be as effective in protecting those interests of the judicary and the rule of law as a strong, respected member of Cabinet, with a clear and unequivocal responsibility to uphold justice and the law.

<a name="40713-17_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   Will the Lord Chancellor give us some evidence of that fact? The idea that Lords Chancellors Hailsham, Mackay, Jowitt or Gardiner could not do that is incomprehensible. The noble and learned Lord&#039;s assertion that, because he is not a judge, a Secretary of State can is incomprehensible. There is no basis in fact for that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The point that I am making is that there is widespread acceptance of the view that the person currently fulfilling the role of Lord Chancellor should no longer sit as a judge. There is also widespread acceptance of the view that a member of the Cabinet cannot discipline judges, cannot deploy individual judges and should not appoint judges on his own. Indeed, the Select Committee was unanimous on those three points.

<a name="40713-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   I apologise for interrupting the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, but we should make it absolutely clear that there is no difference between us on that point. It is entirely common ground that the Lord Chancellor in Cabinet should not be a judge but that he should be a senior lawyer in this House. The Lord Chancellor has articulated a strong case for exactly that conclusion without any question of the man being a judge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, for making that point. There is complete agreement that a judge will no longer be head of the judiciary. The particular authority that came, and comes, to the Lord Chancellor in Cabinet is because he is a judge&#151;the senior judge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   In response to that point, will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor accept that when he was in Birmingham court on Saturday last before 350 young people and an equal number of parents and teachers, his magnetism revolved solely and exclusively round his personal qualities and the fact that he was the Lord Chancellor of England&#151;not because he was Secretary of State for the Department of Constitutional Affairs?

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Just as the Leader of the other place and the Leader of this place have roles requiring them on occasions to put the interests of the Chambers they lead before their political affiliations, so must this Minister when it comes to justice and the protection of the rule of law. Of course, in every case it will depend on the quality and timbre of the holder of the office. He cannot expect his views always to prevail, but his voice must be heard, and the strength of the office depends on its relevance and its defensibility.

<a name="40713-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>In the place of the Lord Chancellor the Bill provides the right combination to provide an office of appropriate certainty. It clearly sets out the responsibilities of the executive and the judiciary. It is unique in that the justice functions given to the Minister by the Bill cannot be removed save by primary legislation. For the first time, it provides for judicial independence with a defined role for the Minister. We shall place on the Minister a clear, statutorily defined role to protect the rule of law. We will debate in later groups the terms of that role but there will be no doubt that such a role will be placed in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The job description&#151;this reflects where the process has got to, not because of 12 June, but the position that already existed&#151;is, therefore, of a Minister with a substantial budget performing a role within government that puts him in a mainstream position in terms of political issues, with a special obligation in respect of justice and the rule of law.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is aware of the relative pattern of powers among departments in government. Does he agree that to have the singular effect that he is now claiming for the future Secretary of State, it would be better to have a department that is as powerful as the Home Office? That would mean switching the criminal justice system from the Home Office to that of the new Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I do not think that it would be necessary to do that, but I agree with the basic proposition that the office we describe has to be strong enough to stand up not just to the department to which the noble Baroness referred, but to any department that may seek to do something that infringes the rule of law. It is also important to remember that the holder of this office has to be someone who is capable of being a Minister expending &#163;3 billion of government money in respect of issues of legitimate public concern. Therefore, the rule of law and the ministerial role must go together.

</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Anybody&#039;s position would be enhanced by access to a substantial pension. I do not put forward substantial pension and large salary as the basis of status&#151;rather, it is the position and the requirements of that position set out in statute; the irremovability of certain functions from him as a result of statute; and the fact that he or she is going to perform a very important role.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Some suggest that incremental change is all that is required; they say, &quot;Don&#039;t abolish&#151;simply change&quot;. The temptation of that course will be great, particularly to this House, but I urge the House to resist.

responsibilities will involve working closely with the judiciary, it is not as a judge that he will be doing this; it is as a Minister. That is the inescapable consequence of his no longer sitting as a judge or being the head of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The time has come to accept this fundamental change. This is not something that has come out of the blue.

<a name="40713-17_spnew10"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The organisation Justice raised these issues back in the 1970s. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said in giving evidence to the Select Committee that the concordat,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;reflects an inevitable development brought about by gradual changes in the office of Lord Chancellor and his department over the past half century&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>We may debate how this change should be achieved. We need to craft, very carefully, the role and standing of the new job to ensure that the proper balance exists. But let us no longer doubt that the change must be made. Some appear to have accepted that argument. I include the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, in that. But they suggest that there may be some benefit in calling the new office holder the Lord Chancellor. Again, I believe that the answer is no. He is not doing the same job. We should recognise that and not suggest that he is. We should also recognise that the job requires the rule of law element&#151;to use shorthand&#151;and the ministerial role. Both those roles must be balanced in the appointment that the Prime Minister makes at a particular time. Furthermore, we do not want there to be any confusion with the new role of the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>Others argue that additional restrictions are required: that the office holder should be a lawyer or a judge, or take a special oath or be a Member of this House. We shall come to those amendments later. I can certainly see that on occasion it would be an attraction to a Prime Minister to have a senior lawyer in the post. I can see the attraction of the holder of this office being in this House. But the question is, should the Prime Minister be constrained to have a senior lawyer in the House of Lords?

Is it not possible to conceive that making a choice between competing skills, the right conclusion for the Prime Minister of the day to come to is that the best man or woman for the job would be someone in another place who was not a qualified lawyer?

<a name="40713-17_spnew14"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I believed that one of the objects of Parliament was to constrain the powers of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is arrogating to himself the powers of the monarch, so we now have the monarch&#039;s powers sitting within Parliament. We must at some point constrain those powers, or we shall go back about 800 years in history.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40713-17_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   This Bill and the debate in relation to it gives Parliament the opportunity to determine whether the changes should take place. I submit that the right course to take is to accept that change should occur. It is welcome change and, rather than seeking to cling to the historical aspects of the argument, we should see what is best to get the protections that I believe we all want.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>Returning to the heart of the debate, the only grounds on which the amendments in this group can be supported is either that the office of Lord Chancellor is not abolished, or, if it is, that the name is retained. I believe that neither of those propositions, in the light of the acceptance of the new architecture, is sustainable. It is not right, and it does not protect either the citizen or the interests of justice, that we continue with the current arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40713-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I believe that we agree about more than we perhaps think. We know what we want the office holder to do. We do not achieve that by refusing to face up to the difference between the job of the Lord Chancellor, as I have described it, and the widely supported functions of the new Secretary of State. I invite the movers of Amendments Nos. 1 and 7 to consider very carefully, in the light of what I have said, whether the best protection for the public and for justice, is to withdraw the amendment and accept the changes that have occurred.

We accept the architecture of the Bill. We simply believe that its foundations would be so much deeper if the role granted to the Secretary of State was played instead by the Lord Chancellor. The issue is simple: what sort of person should perform the role of the Secretary of State as defined in the Bill?

<a name="40713-19_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Uranium Enrichment Technology (Prohibition on Disclosure) Regulations 2004</h3>



<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="40713-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman </b>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 1 July be approved [<i>24th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we face a very real threat from weapons of mass destruction. Nobody in this House could avoid this unhappy fact.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The draft regulations we are discussing this evening concern one key technology used in the civil nuclear industry&#151;uranium enrichment. This technology can also be used in the production of nuclear weapons. We have a responsibility to ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands, and so increase the risk of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These draft regulations will strengthen the protection provided by our law in this area.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I would like to spend a few moments explaining the background to this technology. As many of your Lordships will be aware, the production of fissile material is necessary both for the generation of nuclear power and for the construction of nuclear weapons. One of the ways that this can be achieved is by separating uranium isotopes, a process usually known as enrichment. It was first achieved on an industrial scale during the Manhattan project in the Second World War.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Enrichment of uranium can be achieved in a number of ways. In the UK uranium is enriched by means of a cascade of centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel for power generation. Elsewhere in the world other technologies to enrich uranium are used, such as the gaseous diffusion method employed in France and the USA.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Uranium enrichment technology is used in the civil nuclear industry to produce low-enriched uranium. It is part of the process of manufacturing nuclear fuel for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1195"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

power stations. However, it can also be employed to enrich uranium to a far higher level, which can then be used in nuclear weapons programmes.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Because it can be used to develop nuclear weapons as well in civil nuclear power programmes, uranium enrichment technology is attractive to certain states and to terrorists. In recent decades there have been a number of reported instances of disclosure of this technology. In the 1970s Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani nuclear scientist, illegally acquired this technology from the Netherlands and very recently admitted providing this technology to Libya, North Korea and Iran. In the 1980s Karl-Heinz Schaab, a German national, supplied this technology to Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Uranium enrichment technology is so proliferation-sensitive that we must not allow it to circulate freely even within the UK, because to do so would increase the risk of the technology finding its way into the wrong hands.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Transfers of this technology are already regulated under UK law including by patents and export control legislation. But the coverage of the law is not total. There are gaps that have to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Because of this, these draft regulations will create a new offence of unauthorised disclosure of this technology. The draft regulations are being made under powers in Section 80 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The draft regulations will penalise disclosures made with intent to assist a uranium enrichment programme or disclosures that are made recklessly&#151;by which I mean that the person knows or is indifferent to the risk that an unauthorised disclosure would assist a uranium enrichment programme, or gives no thought to an obvious risk that disclosure would assist such a programme.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The uranium enrichment industry in the UK needs to make disclosures of this technology in the normal course of its business. The draft regulations will address this and other legitimate circumstances by making those persons who make certain limited disclosures of this technology exempt from prosecution. Such exemptions include disclosures authorised by the Government, those made in connection with a patent application for this technology, or where the technology is already legally in the public domain.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>We have also taken full account of the special position of Internet service providers. They will not face prosecution if, for example, they are unaware that information about uranium enrichment technology has been placed on a website they are hosting. To do otherwise would plainly be unjust.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I am very much aware that work on this form of enrichment and related areas may be carried out by the academic and scientific community. I certainly do not want to put barriers in the way of scientists carrying out their research. However, the academic and scientific community need not worry about these draft regulations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1196"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>This is because the draft regulations focus on the key proliferation threat. They prohibit only the disclosure of technology which can be used to enrich uranium&#151;in other words technology which will be of direct assistance to a proliferator. The House will be assured that the regulations do not prohibit disclosure of the research into the generally applicable fundamental science and engineering which enrichment makes use of, nor of items such as centrifuges which have been designed to do things other than to enrich uranium. If a scientist has this technology in his or her possession and wishes to disclose it, he can apply to the security regulator for the nuclear industry&#151;the Office for Civil Nuclear Security&#151;for an authorisation to do so.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>In drawing up the draft regulations, the department has consulted a wide range of interested academic and scientific representative bodies. They include the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering and Universities UK. I am pleased to report that none has opposed the draft regulations. The House may recall that Professor Eyre of the Royal Society recently pointed out that the scientific community must be aware of its responsibility to stop technologies which can be used in weapons of mass destruction from getting into the wrong hands.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Your Lordships will also be aware that the draft regulations were withdrawn and then relaid. We did this so that we could incorporate the suggestion of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments that there should be a delay before the regulations came into force. That was because the penalties for falling foul of the regulations are severe and it is important that everyone should know where we are going before they are introduced. The delay of 28 days will allow us to bring the regulations to people&#039;s attention before they come into force. I am most grateful to the Joint Committee for its valuable scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I probably do not need to remind the House in any way of the threat the world faces from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These draft regulations address one important aspect of that threat and in that light, I commend them to the House. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 1 July be approved. [<i>24th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Lord Triesman</i>.)
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="40713-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his explanation of these regulations and for the excellent explanatory notes published by his department. Of course, we on these Benches support the regulations as we support all measures designed to inhibit the availability of any weapons of mass destruction which may find their way into the hands of bloodthirsty terrorists, to whom human life means little.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>However, I am by no means certain how effective these regulations will be in achieving that objective, because the actual information about the technology is widely available in text books and over numerous websites on the totally uncontrollable and uncensorable Internet. I am equally uncertain how <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1197"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

effective they may be when, as we have seen recently, what I can describe only as rogue scientists have been prepared to give or sell their country&#039;s atomic secrets to others. That has happened in the case of a Pakistani scientist and the Minister gave a few other examples.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>There are valid fears that scientists of the former Soviet Union may have been peddling know-how, and indeed nuclear material itself, as well as essential equipment. There is little doubt about the source of North Korean and Iranian nuclear capability and the threats they pose to the world.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>I was a little concerned that the regulations may impinge on normal academic freedom which enables our universities to teach and our scientists&#151;especially research scientists&#151;to exchange information with colleagues. Academic freedom is a subject which we have debated at length previously and the Government have given assurances that they entirely respect the concept.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I would have liked to have an assurance from the Minister that the exemptions contained in paragraph 2(2) take academic freedom into account. However, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, in introducing these amendments, has given me that assurance. He said that the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering and Universities UK have been consulted and that they agree and that gives much assurance to the House.
</p>

<a name="40713-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Even though, as I said earlier, these regulations may be circumvented by the actions of irresponsible governments and by non-UK persons out of the jurisdiction of our government, they are necessarily to be welcomed as giving our courts some additional powers to deal with those who do assist in undesirable nuclear proliferation. I know that BNFL was consulted by Her Majesty&#039;s Government in the early formulation of the legislation and it, too, is content with it. We are therefore pleased to support the regulations.
</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="40713-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, first, I must apologise to the Minister for missing the opening part of his statement. I was under the impression that the business would be taken in the dinner hour and did not know of the change. However, I assure him that I heard the brief delivered by his right honourable friend in the Commons committee yesterday. It was substantially the same, so I am aware of what was said.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>We welcome measures to prevent terrorism and there can hardly be a more serious combination than nuclear technology and terrorism. However, I must ask whether the regulations are proportionate and appropriate because it would be easy to pass regulations that were disproportionate. For example, although we may feel a terrorist threat here, we do not want to stop all people visiting the Houses of Parliament so we have tried to have a proportionate reaction. Does the Minister believe that these regulations are proportionate?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1198"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I want to explain why, given various factors, I am not sure that they are. First, they cast a further veil of secrecy over the whole of the nuclear industry, which has already had a secretive history and in which the public have a legitimate interest. In fact, one of the points in the Energy Bill, made so ably by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, was that the opening up of the nuclear industry was to be welcomed. Secrecy serves no public interest. I presume that the regulations have been produced in reaction to an Intelligence Service assessment. Can the Minister reassure me of that? As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, said, the knowledge is already out there.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The reality is that throughout the world, where there are nuclear reactors there is a more present threat, as was highlighted in December 2003 when 37 bars of highly enriched uranium were recovered by an international specialist armed unit from a shattered Bulgarian power station. A further eight bars of material went missing, one of which was recovered by the secret services and seven are still missing. If in passing these regulations we therefore believe that we have secured the UK, we are ignoring reality. I believe that we would be better off to put the effort into the kind of programmes in which the United States and Russia are engaged; those of blending down uranium so that it cannot be used in nuclear weapons.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>There other current issues such as nitrate fertilisers, commonly available and quite unregulated. When blended with other commonly available substances, they become lethal. Have the Government given any thought to the chemical compounds which could still be useful to farmers but would make fertilisers far less useful to terrorists? That is the kind of practical regulation that would be helpful.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>At a time when the Government have said they are keeping the nuclear option open&#151;it would be fair to say that several leading Conservatives have been calling for new nuclear-build programmes&#151;public debate on the nuclear issue is liable to be stifled if we see a large number of regulations, of which this is the start, closing down information on the nuclear industry. With these regulations, it will be much harder to ask questions about the safety of processes. How will public meetings be held, especially public inquiries where detailed information should be disclosed with regard to new planning permissions, for example? I notice that the regulations cover building, so presumably those planning permissions will take place on buildings which no one should know about and no one can discuss.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Then there is the matter of the resulting waste. Something will still have to be done with that waste&#151;it will still have to be counted in a waste inventory and finally disposed of, but no one will have the right to know how much is likely to be produced by the technologies which will now be so regulated.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Do regulations denying the public such information comply with their rights under the new Aarhus Convention? The regulations talk of compliance with EU obligations but not with EU conventions. And <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1199"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

how do they relate to the international situation? We are asking other countries to be open about their nuclear processes and ensure that civil programmes do not have military potential, but we will no longer be able to have that assurance in the UK as we shall not know what the Government are sanctioning under the guise of these regulations.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Finally, there is the question of the democratic process. I believe that these are important and highly significant regulations because uranium enrichment should concern us all. In the Commons yesterday, there was the statement that the Minister has repeated here today, followed by one minute of scrutiny. That is not very good. But in this House, we have been allocated a slot in the dinner hour, which is perhaps a little better; it may receive about 20 minutes of scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I believe that the regulations merit a full debate with arguments from all sides. The Minister is looking puzzled. But if all that technology is shielded from public scrutiny, how shall we have the right to know what developments are taking place in the UK? I shall give him an example. New laser isotope enrichments can convert the acid-grade fuel to weapons-grade fuel. That is of great concern. As the non-proliferation treaties proceed, how will the electorate here know what the Government are sanctioning in its name?
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Some time ago, the US Department of Energy declassified information on highly enriched uranium inventories. Among its reasons for doing so was that the data may permit more environmentally relevant information to be provided to stakeholders and the public. Crucially, it may permit more knowledgeable public discussion on uranium storage and disposal. That is part of the process.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I appreciate that that goes slightly wider than the regulations, but I suspect that they are the first of a tranche of regulations to be issued about the industry. At the very time that the industry is expected to expand, we must scrutinise very carefully the veil of secrecy that we are being asked to draw.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Finally, the regulations beg the question of why the UK is planning to enrich yet more uranium when we are committed to nuclear non-proliferation. Why is that?
</p>

<a name="40713-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to both the noble Baronesses, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lady Miller of Hendon, for the points that they made. I shall try to deal with them briefly. First, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, was right to draw attention to the possibility that, given the current state of knowledge in some of these technologies, it will be possible for people to circumvent the requirements of these&#151;or any&#151;regulations. She made the point, with which I wholly agree, that it remains a plain obligation on our part to try to ensure that there is no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I am also happy to repeat my confirmation that the academic community was in the loop during the discussions. The nuclear industry and the scientific community generally were in the loop of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1200"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discussions and it is of some comfort that they had no objection to the principle of the proposals. They were content that viable academic research and the normal exchange of academic information can proceed.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, made some important points, but it may well be that we will disagree to some extent about the processes involved. Are the regulations proportionate? Certainly. The proportionate quality that I shall describe is not because I want to answer the question about any recent intelligence; it is not the Government&#039;s policy to respond to intelligence assessments in either House of Parliament and I have no intention to do so. Indeed, I think that it would raise some eyebrows were I to do so.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>However, I hope that it would be a common concern that various uranium enrichment technologies have become particularly sensitive, precisely because they are commonly used in the production of nuclear fuels in the civil nuclear industry but are so easily adapted for nuclear weapons programmes. The intention is to ensure, as far as possible, that the coverage of existing law is as strong as it can be to try to ensure that the information involved does not escape recklessly. Do many people already have that kind of information? They do. But it is also true that it is an area in which people are continually trying to improve techniques, as well as considering further methods of uranium enrichment. Those techniques and new methods may well be of value to people who have hostile and terrorist intent.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>We would be negligent if we were to say simply that there is a lot of information out there already and that we are content to allow for the possibility that it could spread still further. The regulations are proportionate. They do not deal explicitly with stolen nuclear materials overseas. I do not think that we could make regulations in this House that could conceivably do so. That does not mean that that is not worrying. I share the worries that have been expressed. But they are not part of the regulations. Nor is it a part of the regulations that we consider other commonly available chemicals, that can, with relative ease, be turned into explosives. Quite aside from whether there are good alternatives to nitrate fertilisers, there are probably a number of chemicals which, put together with other chemicals and reactive agents, would produce devastating effects.
</p>

<a name="40713-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The regulations do not cover such matters, although they are of course extremely important and we should try our best to ensure that we are dealing with them appropriately. Nor, with the greatest respect, do I think that this is an issue of planning permission. It may be about the specialist design of specialist buildings that deal with specialist equipment in the process of uranium enrichment. But, generally speaking, most of the issues about the planning arrangements for all kinds of power generation sites are covered in other legislation, including much that we have discussed recently.

<a name="40713-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, because I realise that time is pressing, but, if a building is to be erected for the process of uranium enrichment, will the information about the use of the buildings be available to the public, so that they can make their views known?

<a name="40713-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, when commercial planning permissions are sought&#151;the nuclear energy industry is a commercial proposition&#151;the planning permissions must meet the full range of the planning requirements for information before planning consents can be given. I candidly do not think that that is an area of huge secrecy. It is hard to build a nuclear reactor, if new nuclear reactors are to be built, without people generally being aware of its likely use and the likely content of the nuclear fuel.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>I am now paraphrasing a little, and I apologise for that. Will we deal with declassification of information at the same time as we are encouraging other countries to reveal their nuclear weapons development capability? We are all parties to the non-proliferation treaties. The obligations that we urge on others are obligations under the non-proliferation treaties. They should not be doing the things that they are doing. On our part, the information will not be declassified if that would present a threat to our national security.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>In all conscience, I do not believe that it could be said that the democratic processes or possibilities of debate are limited in the United Kingdom. But, such as they are, the limits certainly concern where it is of grave danger to the peoples of the United Kingdom that weapons of mass destruction or the technologies to build them could be spread.

</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Sainsbury. The Regulatory Reform (Patents) Order 2004 comprises many reforms which in combination will amend the Patents Act 1977. They will do so to make it possible to administer the Patents Act 1977 and the Patents Rules 1995 in a manner compliant with the World Intellectual Property Organisation&#039;s Patent Law Treaty, which I will refer to from now on as the PLT to save time.

</p>

<a name="40713-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>It is also intended to unify the criteria for allowing restoration of a ceased patent and the new provision for reinstatement of a terminated application for a patent; to allow patent applications withdrawn as a result of an error in a request from the applicant to be resuscitated; and to remove an anomaly in the treatment of patents as items of personal property between Scotland, the remainder of the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>While the proposals will be of considerable benefit to patent applicants and patentees, simplifying procedures and removing unnecessary burdens, care has been taken to ensure that they do not in any way undermine the interests of the public in general. In particular, the proposed legislation specifically protects the rights of third parties whenever a patent application whose termination has been made known to the public is resuscitated or reinstated.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The field of patents is specialised. The strange mixture of law with technology means that, in practice, most dealings with the Patent Office are conducted by highly skilled professional representatives working on behalf of patent applicants and patent proprietors. The department has consulted widely, and we are satisfied that these proposals are accepted as sound, reducing processing complexity without affecting the balance between rights-holders and third parties and being substantially cost-neutral. As such, they have been welcomed by those who represent the interests of applicants and patentees.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>Articles 4 to 7 of the draft order seek to remove burdens from the process of making an application for a patent, and, in particular, from the requirements associated with qualifying for a date of filing. The date of filing of an application is important. The priority date of an invention is determined by the date of filing of the first application made in respect of it and sets the temporal boundary of the &quot;state of the art&quot;&#151;that is to say, the known body of knowledge against which the novelty of the invention is to be judged.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The administrative formalities associated with qualifying for a date of filing should, therefore, in so far as it is possible, be reduced to the minimum. At the same time, the maximum scope possible should be afforded to applicants to comply with other less time-sensitive formal requirements by a later date, although this will as a consequence carry the risk that an application may be treated as withdrawn or refused if not all the formal requirements are subsequently complied with.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>It is therefore proposed to reduce the amount of detail that needs to be supplied about the applicant; to make clear that where a description is filed in a foreign language it will still qualify for a date of filing; to allow a reference to an earlier application for the invention to be made instead of filing a description; and to abolish the filing fee and replace it with an application fee that can be paid later.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>It is also proposed to improve on the existing arrangements for the late filing of missing material and to allow such material to be included without amendment of the date of filing where it was wholly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1203"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contained in an earlier application from which the applicant legitimately claims priority rights. The new filing requirements will also keep applicants better informed of the <i>status quo</i> of their applications. In particular, when no application fee is paid at the time of filing, the applicant will be notified of the time available in which to pay it and the consequences of not paying in time.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Payment of the application fee will cause the Patent Office to examine the application for formal defects and to notify the applicant of any outstanding requirements. Between them these two provisions will allow those applicants who wish only to obtain a date of filing to do nothing more than meet the date-of-filing requirements, while at the same time ensuring that those who want to proceed need only pay the application fee to be promptly and fully informed of the outstanding requirements to be complied with. This represents the best use of resources for both applicants and the Patent Office.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Articles 17 and 18 of the order are concerned in part with the resuscitation of applications withdrawn as a result of an error in a request from the applicant, and in part with the extension of time limits specified by the comptroller. The present proposals not only make clear that the error-correction provisions of the Patents Act 1977 are available to correct such mistakes, but will also provide for the protection of third parties whenever the fact that an application has been withdrawn is published before the error has been remedied.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>While many time limits are specified in the Act or prescribed in the rules, there remain some which are set by the comptroller. They are outside the scope of the existing provisions for extension of time periods, and the present reforms will remedy that deficiency. A first extension of any time limit specified by the comptroller will be available on request as of right, provided that the request is made within a prescribed time. Second and subsequent extensions will be allowable at the discretion of the comptroller. There is at present no formal provision for reinstating an application which has been refused or treated as withdrawn as a result of the applicant having failed to meet a time limit.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>Article 8 of the proposed reforms will enable applicants to request, and the comptroller to allow, reinstatement of terminated applications, provided that the applicant can show that there was always a genuine intention to continue with the application. Where notification that an application has been terminated is published, appropriate third-party protection will be a precondition for allowing reinstatement. Article 9 adapts the existing provisions for restoring ceased patents to be uniform with the standards required by the newly instituted reinstatement provisions of Article 8.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I have already mentioned the importance of the date of filing in establishing the priority date of an invention. Until now, declarations of priority have been allowed only when the date of filing of the later application is not more than 12 months after the date of filing of the earlier application from which priority <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1204"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1204</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is claimed. Article 5 of the present proposals will allow the applicant to request, and the comptroller to allow, declarations of priority to be made with respect to applications filed within a limited period after expiry of that 12 months, provided that the applicant can show that it was always his intention to have filed it in time.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Article 10 addresses an anomaly in the treatment of patents as objects of personal property in Scotland, the remainder of the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. Articles 12 to 16 and 19 effect consequential amendments to the Patents Act 1977 and are made necessary by the principal changes, which have already been explained. Articles 20 to 23 provide the transitional arrangements necessary to ensure a smooth introduction of the proposed reforms.
</p>

<a name="40713-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I thank the members of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform for their finding that the present proposals are appropriate to be made under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, and for recommending them to the House. The committee in another place has also considered the proposals. I had not treated them as a repeat of anything said in the other place because the debates in this House are freestanding on the matter. It concluded that they remove burdens within the meaning of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 without removing any necessary protections or preventing the exercise of any existing rights or freedoms. On the committee&#039;s unanimous recommendation, the order was unanimously approved in the other place. I now commend it to this House.

<a name="40713-22_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his very clear, detailed explanation of the order and for his department&#039;s usual excellent Explanatory Notes, which were of great help.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>This is a highly technical order which will easily be understood by a specialist in patent law&#151;indeed, the Minister mentioned that it was often the patent lawyer who got involved in doing this. I am advised by one such patent lawyer, whom I consulted, that the order removes a number of anomalies in the 1977 Patents Act and simplifies what are now considered to be over-rigid time limits and excessively prescriptive procedures for the presentation and granting of applications and transfers of the valuable rights constituted by a patent.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para1"></a>

it was not to be. Perhaps there is a place in your Lordships&#039; House for a patents expert&#151;we may already have one&#151;but I am not one of those.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>On the basis that the order is about the removal or reduction of burdens, the removal of anomalies, and enabling the Act to be administered in conformity with the World Intellectual Property Organisation Patent Law Treaty, we are happy on these Benches to support it.

</p>

<a name="40713-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, could not have spoken a truer word. From the end of January 1977&#151;I think it was 24 January&#151;until some time in July of that year, I occupied the position roughly similar to that of my noble friend Lady Miller. I am neither a lawyer, nor a barrack-room lawyer, nor an expert. I am a mere accountant. I always love to tease my noble neighbour that I am a poor country boy from Angus and a mere accountant, but that did not stop me from assisting my noble friend Lord Belstead with the 1977 Patents Bill, which later became the Patents Act. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, will be gratified to know that in those days the speakers included the Lord Chancellor and the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, who was here for an earlier matter and has now fled the coop&#151;perhaps for good reason; I know not. The Labour government&#039;s Minister was in attendance with a full panoply and representatives of the Patent Office. Those of us on these Benches were briefed from the patent agents. I confirm to the noble Lords, Lord Triesman and Lord Shutt, that it was an extremely detailed and complicated Act, but it did not faze anyone in the accountancy profession, let alone Back-Benchers.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>I really want to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Triesman. I reiterate the thanks given by my noble friend Lady Miller to his department for the clear Explanatory Notes. I wonder whether he could confirm something either quickly tonight or at a later stage. I was invited to look, and did look, at the Explanatory Notes, and my attention was drawn to page 5 of the order. I think that he mentioned Article 5 and the new Section 15A on preliminary examination. Subsection (8)(b) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;As a result of the observations, the comptroller is satisfied that the formal requirements have been complied with&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>It seems to me that this is doing exactly what is spelled out in the Explanatory Notes. Where there is a fairly small or one hopes not particularly significant error&#151;the Latin word that we used in 1977 was lacuna&#151;that can be corrected without major complication or indeed any complication, and that above all will not harm the rights of third parties, the patent applicant will be protected.

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40713-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman </b>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 17 June be approved [<i>23rd Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Sainsbury. I am pleased today to present these regulations to the House. The national minimum wage remains without doubt one of the Government&#039;s finest achievements. It has made a substantial difference for at least 1 million low-paid workers in the United Kingdom every year for the past five years.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>In July last year, the Government asked the independent Low Pay Commission to report on two issues connected with the minimum wage by February 2004. We asked it to review the rates that it had previously proposed for October 2004 in the light of the latest economic position. We also asked it to look at the possible introduction of a new minimum wage rate for 16 and 17 year-olds. The commission reported in February 2004, and the Government announced in March that we accepted their recommendations. In particular, the regulations that we are debating today implement the increases recommended by the commission to the adult and development rates of the minimum wage. They also, as recommended by the commission, introduce a new rate payable to those aged below 18.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>It may be helpful if I briefly explain the regulations. Regulation 1 provides for the regulations to come into force on 1 October 2004. That will give employers sufficient time to prepare and plan for the rate increases, which were, of course, announced by the Government in March. Regulations 2, 4(a) and 4(c) deal with increases to the minimum wage rates. Having laid firm foundations to the minimum wage in the first four years, the Government were able to accept the commission&#039;s recommendation last year that the adult rate should be increased by around 7 per cent. This year, the commission has recommended further increases of around 8 per cent in the case of the adult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1207"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rate, increasing that rate to &#163;4.85 an hour, and 5 per cent for the development rate, taking that to &#163;4.10 an hour.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The commission concluded that these increases were justified, as the overall economic outlook remains favourable, with continuing high employment and very low unemployment levels. In addition, employment across low-paying sectors as a whole is continuing to grow, and there is little or no evidence that the minimum wage is having any adverse impact on these sectors. The increases would extend the coverage of the minimum wage substantially, so that 1.6 to 1.9 million low-paid workers stand to benefit. That can only be good for the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Regulation 3(a) has the effect of providing that workers under 18 and who are over school-leaving age now qualify for the minimum wage. Regulation 4(b) sets a minimum wage rate of &#163;3 an hour for such workers. The Government agreed last year that the commission should consider that issue, following the findings in its 2003 report that some full-time jobs were offering extremely low levels of pay and minimal training to young workers. The commission has found continued evidence that some jobs in this age group offer very low rates of pay and little or no training. The commission concluded that it is important to introduce a minimum wage for 16 and 17 year-old workers in order to stop exploitative rates of pay. The Government agree.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>However, it is clearly important to set any rate for this group cautiously. Unemployment and employment levels for 16 and 17 year-old workers are substantially worse than for those aged 18 to 21, and the Government&#039;s main priority for people in this age group is for them to remain in education or training, which would be in their long-term interest, rather than to take up low-paying jobs. The commission concluded that a rate of around &#163;3 per hour would have little impact on young people&#039;s decisions on whether to remain in education. The implementation of education maintenance allowances this autumn also seems likely to encourage young people to stay in education rather than opt for low-paying jobs. The Government therefore accepted a rate of &#163;3 an hour. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 only covers people,

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>A key issue that needs to be considered is the position of very young apprentices. We know that many 16 and 17 year-old apprentices earn less than the new rate of &#163;3 an hour and that many 18 year-old apprentices earn less than the new 18 year-old rate of &#163;4.10 an hour. We are very concerned to ensure that employers continue to offer apprenticeships and, recognising that they are breaking new ground and will feel the need for caution, the commission recommended that apprentices aged under 18 should not be entitled to the new rate. The Government have accepted the commission&#039;s recommendation.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>The Low Pay Commission also recommended that people aged under-18 who are on schemes at a pre-apprenticeship level should be exempt from the new rate. The Government think it is sensible that workers on these schemes should be exempt from the minimum wage, bearing in mind that, as I mentioned earlier, they would be exempt from the minimum wage for at least the first 12 months if they progressed on to an apprenticeship. Regulation 3(c) lists the pre-apprenticeship schemes.
</p>

<a name="40713-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>Regulation 5 increases the value of the accommodation outset. That is the amount that may be taken into account when determining whether the minimum wage has been paid in situations where a worker is provided with living accommodation by the employer. The amount&#151;again, the recommendation of the commission&#151;is increased from &#163;3.50 to &#163;3.75 per day.

<a name="40713-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Regulation 6 makes some minor amendments as a consequence of the fair piece rate regulations that were passed by this House in the spring.

As the Minister has told us, these regulations increase the basic hourly national minimum wage from &#163;4.50 to &#163;4.85 and the lower hourly rate is increased from &#163;3.80 to &#163;4.10.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Of course, we accept the principle of the national minimum wage, but those increases are substantially above inflation. We are a little concerned that that might impact on competitiveness.

<a name="40713-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for explaining the Motion, which I support. However, I should like to make a couple of comments based on personal experience. For some years, I have been a non-executive director of a not-for-profit guest-house. In circumstances where people are being paid above these rates, one knows that when the rates are changed the people just above also change. If the increase is above the rate of inflation, one has to think very carefully about its effect. If one is running a not-for-profit organisation, which is a tight ship, these things have to be worked out.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>There is a great deal of perception that people will not pay certain prices, particularly when they have to be increased above the rate of inflation. It is therefore very important that when changes like this have to be made maximum notice is given. In the guest house and catering industries, particularly when looking at tariffs, which have to be planned in advance, maximum notice of changes is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>It is my belief that people are prepared to pay proper prices and not exploit people for accommodation, services, catering and so forth. But the people who run such business need to know when changes are to be made and they need the maximum amount of notice. With that contribution about being given maximum notice in terms of changes that may take place in the future, I am happy to support the Motion.

</p>

<a name="40713-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The regulations are important. More than 1.6 million workers stand to benefit from the increases.

<a name="40713-23_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40713-23_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty) </b>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 22 June be approved [<i>22nd Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are considering the Landfill (Scheme Year and Maximum Landfill Amount) Regulations which set the maximum amount by weight of biodegradable municipal waste allowed to be sent to landfill in the UK. The instrument is made under the Waste Emissions Trading Act 2003.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The regulations set the maximum amount of biodegradable waste that the UK will be required to landfill over the next 15 years. They then divide the UK&#039;s obligations under the Landfill Directive between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by setting targets for 2010, 2013 and 2020. These target year dates take into account the four-year derogation available to the UK under the directive.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>In order to encourage a steady reduction in landfilling and so reduce the risk of the UK breaching its targets, this instrument sets maximum amounts which can be landfilled for the years leading up to the first target in 2010. Thereafter straight-line reductions to the latter targets will apply. Separate national regulations will be made in each country to implement landfill allowance schemes. The regulations for landfill allowances and a trading scheme in England will be laid before Parliament shortly. In Wales the National Assembly has already approved the Welsh landfill allowances scheme and similar regulations are being drafted for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>This instrument also amends the definition of scheme year in the Waste and Emissions Trading Act from 17 July to 16 July and from 1 April to 31 March. As noble Lords will remember, this was a matter of some debate during the passage of the primary legislation. However, this change brings the scheme year onto the same footing as the financial year for central and local government. For Wales the scheme has been further amended to allow the scheme to start in October this year part way through a scheme year. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland the schemes will start on 1 April 2005.

</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="40713-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the regulations and particularly for the knowledge that the scheme year is to be the same as the financial year. As the noble Lord said, it was a fruitful source of debate when we were dealing with the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>These regulations are going to bring about a really major change in the way in which we handle waste in this country. While the Bill provided for the establishment of this scheme of targets for each year, the only target that I am really concerned about is the one at the end. Given that we are postulating a major change in the handling of waste and given the complexities and delays imposed by the planning system which can take a long time, and the difficulties that authorities have had in making up their minds as to how they are to handle these problems, I hope that there will be some sympathy from the Government if waste disposal authorities fail to meet the interim targets, provided that the Government can be confident that they are going to meet the final target, because that is the one which matters.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>It has to be said that the change to be brought about will be very expensive. One looks at what is spent at present in this country on waste collection and management. It amounts to &#163;1.8 billion. If one extrapolates from the Dutch experience which already meets the 2015 target, our expenditure needs to rise to &#163;3 billion. If one looks at what has happened under the Comprehensive Spending Review, the fact is that the increases in expenditure do not suggest that the money will be available. The particular figure which causes me concern is the extra Private Finance Initiative credits for investment to increase to &#163;155 million by 2007&#150;08. My own local authority will require to spend &#163;200 million in order to meet this target. If one extrapolates from that level of expenditure, the PFI credits presently being provided will not prove adequate to enable these targets to be met.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>None the less, we have to accept that the effort has to be made because there is the threat of fines of &#163;500,000 per day in 2018 or 2019 if we fail. But I am bound to say to the noble Lord that in my view, horrendous though that fines is, it is less than the cost of financing the improvements which will need to be made in order to avoid paying the fine. That is quite an interesting calculation.
</p>

<a name="40713-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>That said, I would not advocate being in the position of having to pay the fine because that would be dead money. At least if you are investing, you will get something back for what you are paying out.

<a name="40713-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, we welcome the order and the targets it will lay down. It will ensure some certainty about what the targets are for those who will need to work towards them. After hazardous waste, biodegradable waste could be said to be the most difficult kind of waste to deal with because it is hard to persuade individual householders and commercial interests to separate it. I believe that further work needs to be done in this area. All too often the answer has been to give householders subsidised compost bins. Biodegradable waste deposited in such bins turns into a very unpleasant sludge which puts everyone off trying to make compost.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The future may lie in more widespread municipal composting. Can the Minister tell me whether BSI standards have been set for compost? If the end product were proved to be truly useful, that would mark a good step forward. If householders are enthusiastic about separating their waste, perhaps the Government might like to encourage local authorities to give the resulting compost away. I realise that that is a matter for individual authorities, but it is a proposal which needs to be considered.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Has any work been undertaken on the link between this order covering composting&#151;by which time biodegradable waste has ceased to be a waste product and has become a resource once more&#151;and the European Union soils directive, which requires a great deal of soil improvement to take place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40713-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the support of both opposition Front-Benchers for the order, and in particular for the recognition of the need for a substantial shift in the way in which we deal with waste in this country. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, also recognised that the redefinition of the financial year will be helpful to local authorities and others. Although I was slightly startled at one point when I thought that he was about to advocate non-payment of fines and civil disobedience, it is undoubtedly true that this work will be expensive. The fines reflect the importance of potential breaches. However, it is important that we recognise the benefits both to society and to the environment from achieving these targets. It is an expensive effort for local authorities and will mean a change in behaviour on the part of both householders and commercial bodies.

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the issues surrounding the separation of biodegradable waste and composting standards, how to persuade householders to separate their waste and then how to treat it. Discussions are going on between ourselves, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the various municipal authorities to review Defra guidance on municipal waste management strategies, as well as on the guidance that is appropriate for the planning system, a point referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. That work is ongoing. I cannot <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40713-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, was correct to say that the end target is the most important thing, but it is also important that local authorities are kept on a trajectory towards that end target. That is why the directive has been drafted in this way and why we are specifying the targets for the interim years as well.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Turning to the point about an overlap with the EU soils strategy, I think that that is slightly limited in relation to the provision before us because we will be dealing with different methods of disposal of the waste created in fields and elsewhere. However, there may be some crossover and I shall look into that.

<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: I am not sure whether this is a drafting or a probing amendment, but it seems to me that the word &quot;continued&quot; serves no real purpose. Everybody accepts that the judges are independent now. Why does that fact need to be stated in the Bill? My suggestion is that the word &quot;continued&quot; is verbiage. If we do have to have an adjective qualifying independence, then I would suggest that &quot;existing&quot; is a better word than &quot;continued&quot;. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="40713-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   There does not seem to be much between us. The duty of all Ministers to uphold the independence of the judiciary is nothing new. There has always been an expectation that Ministers will behave in this way, even though it has not previously been expressed as a statutory duty.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Clause 1 gives statutory force to what is now a matter of convention and will ensure that our long history of an independent judiciary continues. We believe that putting the duty into statute and ensuring that it extends to all Ministers will provide stronger protection for judicial independence than exists now.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>However, although the form of protection will be enhanced, we believe that the substance of what we are protecting should be defined by reference to what we have now: the sophisticated and well respected notion of judicial independence as it has developed over the centuries. As now drafted, the clause adds certainty that what we now know to be the case will not change.

<a name="40713-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>Removing the word &quot;continued&quot; from this duty would suggest that one is seeking to remove the link with the existing concept of judicial independence. I am not sure what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, is seeking to achieve by this but it may be, as he said, that it is simply a probing amendment.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>The function of the word sought to be deleted is simply to ensure that judicial independence is defined and must develop in line with the concept as it is now understood. It will not freeze the content of judicial independence at a particular point in time. In exact accord with the judicial method in the common law system, it will simply ensure that the starting point for any consideration of what judicial independence requires must be the concept as it was known at the time the Bill is enacted. The concept can of course evolve to reflect changing circumstances, but the parameters of any such evolution must surely be set by what exists now.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord would imply something else: that the Bill was declaring some new principle, in a deliberate break with the past. From what he has said, I do not think that is what he intends. I am encouraged in that respect by his use of the word &quot;existing&quot;. I do not think that there is much difference between us, therefore.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Declaring such a break with the past&#151;which I do not think he intends&#151;without defining the content of the implied new principle would, in my opinion, sow confusion and uncertainty in an area where clarity and certainty are crucial factors. It is very important in an area such as this that all those concerned have as much certainty as possible as to what is expected of them. What the current provision states clearly is that we want to perpetuate the existing state of affairs, allowing for gradual evolution in accordance with changing circumstances. That must surely be the correct approach to a principle of such crucial constitutional importance.

<a name="40713-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>If we are moving towards a written constitution&#151;which in a number of respects we are&#151;we can all agree that it should be inclusive. Some may argue that such an amendment to this Bill is unnecessary and that a recognition of the rule of law is omnipresent in every ministerial office. A happy picture indeed to visualise, and I hope that it applies to the office of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, together with his ministerial colleague. If that was ever true, however, it certainly cannot be regarded as an accurate description of some of the policies of the Home Office under the leadership of the present Home Secretary. Mr Blunkett, as we recognise, has many exceptional qualities, but I do not think he would claim that a willing deference to the rule of law is among them. His recent setback over the handling of immigration appeals is only one of a number of Home Office policies to have been successfully challenged in the courts.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>This amendment, however, is not an occasion for partisan point-scoring; it is intended to be constructive. I recall the controversy over mandatory sentencing under a Home Secretary who now leads, very successfully, my own party. I refer to Michael Howard. An issue when Michael Howard was the Home Secretary in a Conservative administration was that injustice could result where the sentence for a criminal offence was a mandatory sentence fixed by law rather than one which was adjusted to reflect the severity of an offence and the harm done.
</p>

<a name="40713-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>One of the difficulties in adhering to the rule of law is to recognise situations in which it arises, where it may be applied and where it is relevant. Let me give an example. Not long ago the present Government attempted to strengthen the enforcement of probation orders by withdrawing supplementary benefit from offenders who had failed to conform with the requirements of a probation order, very often by failing to report to their supervising officer, which is at the heart of the probation concept.

<a name="40713-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>It was a salutary experience to try to persuade the department concerned at that time&#151;the DHSS or the Department for Employment&#151;that such action would be contrary to the rule of law and that entitlements to social security payments were based upon entirely separate considerations. Finally, after the issue had been raised both in this House and in print, the department gave way and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;the Minister then as now&#151;was able to assist in devising some alternative penalties.

<a name="40713-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>That may be regarded as a relatively minor example, but often matters of principle arise out of humdrum situations which are not recognised at the time as amounting to conspicuous issues of injustice. It is just one example which illustrates the need for vigilance.

<a name="40713-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>More broadly, there is a large body of received political wisdom surrounding the definition and the meaning of the rule of law, the subject of the amendment, and the notion of constitutional legality.

its application. However, what can be claimed without fear of contradiction is that the rule of law is an honourable inheritance which has been developed over a lengthy period of time and which upholds fundamental British values and the political society we enjoy today. Long may it continue. It is our responsibility to ensure that it does.

<a name="40713-24_para23"></a>

<a name="40713-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   Amendment No. 19, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart, is grouped with Amendment No. 3. We on these Benches support Amendment No. 3. We think it is right that all Ministers should be required by statute to uphold the rule of law as well as the independence of the judiciary. However, there are issues which have not yet been resolved about what this obligation really means and how it is to be implemented. Some of these issues are raised by Amendment No. 19.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>There can be no doubt that the rule of law is a principle of the constitution and has been so for at least 300 years. That battle was fought for most of the 17th century, from the struggle between Lord Coke and Lord Chancellor Bacon in the early years of the century up to the Act of Settlement around the end of it. However, it is difficult to define the rule of law. Some would say that it is mainly or wholly procedural, that rights and powers must be exercised in accordance with established law and not by arbitrary decision, or that principles of natural justice must be applied, such as that no one must be a judge in their own cause and that both sides are entitled to be heard.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>It is less clear whether the rule of law has a substantive content. The question arises whether there are laws, such as the Nazi race laws, which are so repugnant to fundamental human rights that they cannot be regarded as legitimate laws at all.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The question has been raised that if the Government were to introduce laws which were inconsistent, or might be thought by some to be inconsistent, with the rule of law, would the courts be bound to apply them? If the judges have power to disregard laws in such cases, then we get a potential conflict between the rule of law and another principle of the constitution, which is the sovereignty of Parliament. We have not had to resolve that issue and I hope we never will. I do not think that we should aim to decide it in this Bill. That means that we should not use the Bill to restrict the sovereignty of Parliament as it exists.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We believe that the duty of Ministers to uphold the rule of law will be part of the legal background when reviewing an executive decision or the validity of secondary legislation, but the decision of a Minister to lay legislation before Parliament should not be capable of being restrained because that legislation is arguably contrary to the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>The possibility of a judicial review before an Act of Parliament or a Bill is laid before Parliament is a route to the rule of lawyers rather than the rule of law. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1217"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is why Amendment No. 19 spells out that nothing in the Bill is intended to derogate from the sovereignty of Parliament.
</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. As I understand it, following the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our law, the Minister is under a duty not to put before Parliament a Bill which contains a contravention of the convention. Why should that same principle not apply to the rule of law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I do not believe that there is such a duty. There is a requirement in the Human Rights Act that there must be a statement on whether the Bill complies, but I do not think there is any duty not to lay a Bill before Parliament. The sovereignty of Parliament still permits a Minister to lay before Parliament a Bill that does not comply with the rule of law. Indeed, as I understand it, the Civil Partnership Bill now before the House of Commons following its hectic passage through your Lordships&#039; House contains a statement by the Minister that she is not satisfied that it does comply with the European Convention.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Does it not follow from the obligation to certify a Bill that, should a Minister conclude that a Bill were not certifiable, he would be restrained from promoting it? Alternatively, he would have to place on the Bill, &quot;I am promoting this Bill even though I do not think that it complies with the European Convention&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   The second point is obviously correct, but the first point is not. For example, it must be correct that it is open to any government who saw fit to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 as a matter of constitutional legality. I cannot think that anything less than that would, in itself, involve something that was restrainable by any judicial process.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>Amendment No. 3 concerns duties under Clause 1(1) which apply to Ministers generally. It does not apply to the specific duties of the Minister&#151;or the Lord Chancellor as we must now continue to call him following the passing of the amendment earlier today. The specific duties are covered by Amendment No. 10 and in part also by Amendment No. 19, although I will not now deal with the particular part of that amendment which relates to the specific duties of the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The Government have not yet come up with their own amendments on the rule of law issues. It is desirable to see them before we take a vote on this issue, if indeed we have to take a vote. Therefore, although we support Amendment No. 3, we hope that it will not be put to the vote today and we do not intend to press our own amendment to a vote in Committee so that we can give time for further consideration of the rather complex and abstruse issues raised by the duty to uphold the rule of law.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I have two points. I will return to the definition of the rule of law, but my first point is an <br>&nbsp;<br>

interesting one. Something has always puzzled me, and what happened over the Civil Partnership Bill is a good illustration. I have always been concerned about what would happen if a Bill were introduced that was compliant with the Human Rights Act and had the ministerial certificate, but was then amended&#151;which would have to happen in the House of Lords, because the Government have not lost a Division in the Commons since 1997&#151;which made that Bill non-compliant. Of course, the Minister would have to introduce it to the Commons and say that it was not compliant in order to use the Commons majority to make it compliant. That probably answers the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. The Bill must be promoted as non-compliant in order to use the power of the Commons to make it compliant. I think that that answers the puzzle that I have always had about what would happen if a Bill became non-compliant on its passage.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>To return to my second point, as members of the Committee who were on the Select Committee will remember, we had long discussions about the rule of law. There were nine lawyers out of 16 of us and it was a very interesting discussion. I was interested in the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. He said that it was hard to define the rule of law. In fact, I do not think that it has ever been defined. I asked a number of members of the Select Committee, &quot;Could you please define the rule of law?&quot; Nobody could. Amendment No. 19 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;The rule of law is a principle of the constitution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>Is it not odd to include in the Bill a principle of the constitution that cannot be defined? Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor would like to have a go at defining it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="40713-25_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I follow the noble Lord, Lord Carter, if only because we have one thing in common: he and I are not lawyers. The noble Lord performed an immensely valuable function in the Select Committee by producing solutions to all those parliamentary questions that arose, just as he has now.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>He has attempted to steal my function which, as a non-lawyer, is to ask what I call the Pooh Bear or damn-fool question, which sometimes produces astonishing truth when put to the experts.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>It is in that spirit that I intervene. I have no great difficulty with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I accept that the rule of law is the principle of the constitution. He put it to one of our most eminent witnesses that the courts would assume that it was and would act on that basis. Equally, I have no difficulty with the principle of the sovereignty of Parliament. I do not think that anyone in the Committee argued that whatever the lawyers decided, they were interpreting the law as made by Parliament, and Parliament could always change the law. We are not far apart on that. I am glad to hear that we shall come back to the noble Lord&#039;s amendment when we have all considered it again.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>My reason for intervening on the proposition that we should include a specific reference to the rule of law is that on that point we have the support of the Lord <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1219"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1219</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. On page 152 of the evidence section, in answer to question No. 501 put by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, the Lord Chief Justice said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;It seems to me that it is very desirable that there should be a clear statement which reflects the need for the protection of the rule of law and I can well see that there is a very important role for the individual, whether he be called the Lord Chancellor or whether he be Secretary of State, to perform the function that you have just identified within government&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Encouraged by the fact that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, thinks it is a good idea to have a specific rule, I turn to the Committee&#039;s opinion, expressed in paragraph 73. We decided, unanimously I think, or certainly without difficulty, that there should be a reference to the rule of law. The Lord Chancellor undertook to produce a suitable amendment. The only point that I made at that stage because we were well advanced in our deliberations is that I hoped that his amendment would come back in adequate time for us to consider it, and not on the last Tuesday on which we were sitting when we would have to agree it without proper consideration. About 10 days passed and no amendment came from the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>That is why I intervene today. I am pretty confident that the Lord Chancellor produced an amendment and then found that he was in considerable difficulty with his colleagues in Cabinet, particularly the Home Secretary. There was then great difficulty in reaching agreement on an amendment that would be acceptable both to those of us who wanted to defend the rule of law and to the Home Secretary. That encourages on why we need a specific reference in the legislation on that point.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The Lord Chancellor came back eventually in the final week&#151;so late that we had to sit on the Thursday to consider the final draft of the committee&#151;and we looked at the amendment, which is in the record so I need not read it out. It seemed to be one of the great masterpieces drafted by Sir Humphrey. Sir Humphrey had clearly been brought back from retirement&#151;perhaps because the most distinguished Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department gives a masterly performance of Sir Humphrey on charitable occasions. Those of us who have attended at Smith Square on one of those occasions will know that he is a master at performing the role of Sir Humphrey, and may have wondered perhaps whether, in drafting this amendment, he made a contribution to it. But it was a contribution of such obscurity, in its complex bringing together of the need to protect the rule of law with the need to maintain the supremacy of Parliament, that a very large number of us in the Committee said that we simply could not accept it.

<a name="40713-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and my noble friend Lord Kingsland produced very clear amendments whose objectives we could all understand.

the clearer amendments tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and my noble friend&#151;were all withdrawn on the simple basis that as a Committee we decided that we could not press to a Division amendments on which we could not agree. That is why we are back in the House this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40713-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>This is an important issue, which goes back to that issue referred to in the earlier debate about the inevitable tension in government between those who protect the rule of law and those with equally important functions&#151;the functions of the Home Secretary&#151;in trying to maintain law and order. As a non-lawyer, I certainly do not have a solution, and I support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in saying that this is probably not an issue that we shall press to a conclusion tonight. However, before this Bill leaves the House, and certainly before it becomes an Act, we should have greater clarification than we have at present. We need to have, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said that we should have, a very clear statement in the Bill to protect the rule of law.

<a name="40713-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord will agree with me that it is extremely hard to define the rule of law&#151;and if it is extremely hard to define, how does one know that one is in breach of it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   That is exactly the question of which I said that the noble Lord was following my example in asking the damn fool question that sometimes produced interesting answers. Surrounded as I am by some of the most eminent lawyers in the country, and indeed the world&#151;lawyers with a huge reputation&#151;I hope that before we reach the end of our proceedings, we shall have enlightenment. And who better to give us enlightenment than the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor himself?
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I should like to say, before the noble Lord sits down, that the situation is surely that one does not always know when one is in breach of the rule of law, but that there are times when one knows when one is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I had thought that I had sat down, but I note what the noble Lord says.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I support the amendment so ably and concisely moved by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham. Until now, it has been the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role to be what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, described as the guardian of constitutional propriety. Although that has been a vital role, until now it has never been spelt out in any statute. But now that role is to be codified in Clause 1, which imposes both a general duty on Ministers and a special duty on the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>Since the role is now to be codified, it is surely vital that the wording of Clause 1 sets out the whole of that duty as guardian and does so in clear and forceful language. At present, Clause 1 fails in that in several <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1221"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1221</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

different respects, which will be covered by the various amendments&#151;the one now before us and some of its successors.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>In respect of this amendment, the trouble with Clause 1 is that it relates only to the independence of the judiciary and says nothing about upholding or defending the rule of law. That, when one is codifying, is a very serious omission, because if part of a duty is expressed and the other part is not, the inevitable conclusion is that the second half no longer exists. A nauseating Latin expression used by lawyers is <i>expressio unis est exclusio alterius</i>. It means that if we say that it is the duty of Ministers to uphold the independence of the judiciary and do not also say that it is their duty to uphold the rule of law, we have lost their duty to uphold the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor accepts that principle. Indeed, in his closing speech in the somewhat better attended earlier debate he referred specifically to the duty to uphold the rule of law being part of the function of the relevant Minister. As the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, has said, at a late stage he put an amendment before the committee that was met with almost universal criticism and was withdrawn. Our present solution is very simple. It is to insert the rule of law alongside judicial independence as the things that must be upheld.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>The answer, with respect to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, is&#151;to paraphrase some words of Lord Denning&#151;&quot;I may have difficulty in defining it but I can recognise it when I see it&quot;. The answer is that one can recognise something that is in breach of the rule of law, even if one cannot write a sentence that codifies precisely what it means.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is correct that once the words &quot;rule of law&quot; have been inserted in Section 1(1) they also have to be inserted in Section 1(4), and that that is dealt with by Amendment No. 10. I am delighted to hear that the Liberal Democrats support this amendment. I must confess that I have some problems with their Amendment No. 19. I am not sure whether it is meant to be an alternative or a cumulative amendment. I would point out two slightly difficult problems with it. The first is that it imposes a duty in relation to the rule of law on the one Minister only. That is curious when the duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary is imposed first on all the Ministers and secondly under Section 1(4)&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   Amendment No. 19 was tabled after Amendment No. 3, so it was taken to be cumulative to that amendment. The difference is that Amendment No. 3 deals with the rule of law as it applies to Ministers as a whole in Section 1(1). It does not deal with the specific duty of the Lord Chancellor under Section 1(4). Therefore, something else needed to be put in to deal with that. That would be either Amendment No. 10 or Amendment No. 19.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord for that explanation. The other difficulty with Amendment No. 19 is that it appears to deal with the <br>&nbsp;<br>

rule of law somewhat differently for the independence of the judiciary, and I suspect that if the Government do not accept this amendment we will need to get together and produce a compendium version. I suggest to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that the right thing to do at the moment is to accept Amendment No. 3, write in the rule of law there and then go on to decide what further amendments are needed. I hope that idea will commend itself to him.

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40713-26_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   One of the beauties of the House of Lords is that noble Lords who have not been part of Select Committees are entitled to contribute to the debate. I speak with a consciousness of great humility because we have heard a brilliant Sophoclean dialogue between noble Lords who were members of the Select Committee, and not many other noble Lords have taken part in the debate so far.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I am not a lawyer and therefore I shall address in fairly simple terms the arguments that a politician might bring to bear on this particular argument. One of the things that emerges&#151;and I think I might use the words &quot;<i>apr&#232;s le deluge&quot;&#151;</i>is how we find a basis of agreement because clearly it would be an impossible situation for the two Houses to enter into an unending game of ping-pong with no outcome. It would do considerable and grave damage to the status and standing of Parliament. My brief remarks in this discussion are directed towards how we might move steadily towards some sort of broadly acceptable compromise. I will not go back to the issue of the title because that has been decided, for at least the time being, by a substantial majority in the Committee. Frankly, I do not think that it matters as much as the substance of the role of the new Minister.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>From my point of view, and probably from that of many outside the House, the key question is not so much the title as the role, significance and weight of the person who holds office in the department that will be responsible for upholding the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. That is obviously the crucial consideration, so we should address the question of how we improve the standing, status and weight of this department.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>It is well known that the Liberal Democrats believe that the best way to do that is to create a Ministry of Justice, which would include the criminal justice responsibilities of the existing Home Office, and leave the Home Office more involved in the application and execution of law than the making of law and legal guidelines. Since for the moment that simply is not a possibility, much as we would like it to be, the House must address itself to every possible way in which it can enhance the status of the department that will be responsible, whether the title of the noble and learned Lord is Lord Chancellor or Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.

We also need to consider the argument for the person concerned being a lawyer, with a more instinctive knowledge of the rule of law. We also need to consider the question of whether he or she should sit in this House or another. On that, I am persuaded by the arguments of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that the Prime Minister should not be constricted in that way.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>Finally, we must address the most difficult question of them all. The Lord Chancellor, in his speech on the first group of amendments, pointed to the need for the most capable, able, intelligent and, above all, courageous person to be appointed to the job we are now discussing. I hate to say it, but we must address the fact that there is no longer the trust in politicians that once existed. Therefore, arguing that the crucial issue is who a Prime Minister&#151;any Prime Minister&#151;has in mind and that he will always have regard to the integrity and courage of that person rather than to his own association, party links or whatever, no longer carries a great deal of weight with the public.
</p>

<a name="40713-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>For those reasons, I believe that we need to be more specific about some of the powers that should adhere to this department and about some of the requirements <br>&nbsp;<br>

we would expect the person appointed to it to meet. We must recognise the fact that that extraordinarily negative vote we have just seen in part arises as much from distrust in politicians as it does from the view that the title Lord Chancellor should be retained.

<a name="40713-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I want to follow the noble Baroness in the wider ground which she has opened up before us, but it is better to confine myself strictly to the amendment now before the Committee. I support Amendment No. 3.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>In the Select Committee, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will confirm, we waited anxiously from day to day for the Government to produce an amendment to cover the inclusion of the rule of law. At that stage, I thought that that was common ground. Eventually, at the 59th minute of the final hour, an amendment was produced and it was, as accurately described by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, quite unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>If I had been asked before 12 June 2003 whether we should ever be debating in this House an amendment which would require Ministers of the Crown to uphold the rule of law, I would have thought that was perfectly absurd. Of course Ministers must uphold the rule of law. It is one of the basic facets of our constitution. But all that changed when the Government decided to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor. It is because of that decision&#151;and only because of that decision&#151;that this amendment is now necessary. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40713-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   I support the amendment. The wider appreciation of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, encapsulated some of my own thoughts and anxieties. I know not yet how those may be resolved. The rule of law and judicial independence as such are all but incapable of definition. Being incapable of definition, they cannot be enforced by any court of law. There is no suggestion that they should be or that Clause 1 should be amended to confer express jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>That being so, I come back to the way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, presented the situation. I do not know what the committee&#039;s view was, as I was not a member. I just read the report, but I did not find much in it to help me with this problem. Is it to be assumed that the committee took the view that these obligations, as they were incapable of definition and enforcement by the courts, should not be enforced by the courts? If it took that view&#151;and I have a feeling that it may have done, although I do not know what its view was&#151;

There is a far wider problem apart from the question; it was raised eloquently and objectively by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. What was the Select Committee&#039;s attitude? Was it that there would be no recourse to enforcement of these obligations by the courts or was it not? I assume that, as the obligations could not be defined, they could not be enforced by the courts.

<a name="40713-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   If the obligations cannot be enforced by the courts, it seems that the only way in which they can be enforced is by retaining the persuasive powers of the Lord Chancellor in a constitutional role in the Cabinet.

</p>

<a name="40713-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The Bill is about the independence, structure and administration of the judiciary. In any written constitution, that would be a discrete chapter. Although I commend the sentiment that the rule of law should prevail in our justice system, to latch it on to the end of a clause dealing with the independence of the judiciary is constitutionally clumsy. If we were debating a written constitution, the role of the rule of law and our obligation throughout government and justice to maintain it would be a declaratory statement and the first or second article of a written constitution.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>It is therefore inappropriate for us now to use the phrase loosely, as if we all know what it means, in the context of this clause, for the following reasons. First, the rule of law requires to be defined. It is not a law in the sense of an enforceable law between parties, so much as a constitutional principle that feeds the justice of the community to which that constitution applies.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>Secondly, in determining what the phrase means constitutionally to our community, we must consider broader considerations than justice. Clause 1 refers in subsection (1) to the role of Ministers and those connected with the administration of justice. The rule-of-law obligation should apply to all Ministers in all departments.

That is not to demean the intent of the amendment, rather to ensure that when we debate it further, and when my noble and learned friend from the Government considers it, our responses are produced carefully. What he says tonight and hereafter will be seized on as the view of the Government on the status of the rule of law in our constitution. That requires very careful thought. The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, is extremely simple; the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is analytically unacceptable when it is subjected to some careful thinking, and neither really achieves the intent of all parties.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para8"></a>

In other words, it would read, &quot;Ministers of the Crown and all others with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary&quot;. If it is meant to apply to all Ministers of whatever kind, whether concerned with the judiciary or otherwise, that ought to be made explicit. I can see some lawyer appearing before the Judicial Committee&#151;I hope that it is still in existence&#151;arguing that there is a doubt about this.
</p>

<a name="40713-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>It is common in constitutions for there to be a reference to the rule of law simply as a principle of the constitution. I hope that I am not misremembering, but I think that in the Treaty of Rome as amended, and in the draft constitution, there is a reference to the rule of law as a principle of the constitution. That seems to me&#151;despite the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, which I well understand&#151;to point without doubt to not including a definition of the rule of law in the Bill. Judges have been applying the rule of law, enforcing it, making people act in accordance with the rule of law, and preventing people acting contrary to the rule of law for a long time without necessarily on every occasion giving a clear, specific, detailed definition of it.

<a name="40713-27_spnew10"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   Perhaps I may build on this debate. Much of what we have been saying today seems to have been a struggle towards some articulation of social transcendence. That may sound rather abstract and pretentious, but we are trying to find a way of speaking about that which overrules even that which rules us, or even those who rule us, and to which those who rule us are, in some sense, accountable, even if they could get a popular majority for a quite different course of action.

Nevertheless, it is an important obligation that we do not lose the fact that that is what is emerging from this important debate about this important Bill.

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, another question about his amendment. New subsection (3) in Amendment No. 19 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;Nothing in this Act shall derogate from the sovereignty of Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>As I understand it, the sovereignty of Parliament is a doctrine of the courts. If I am correct in that, what function does making a reference to it serve? The courts in their jurisprudence will determine exactly what the sovereignty of Parliament is in a particular context. They might take the view, as did many courts in the 16th and 17th centuries, that the sovereignty of Parliament was qualified by the genius of the common law; or, as in 19th century Benthamite England, they might take a much more robust view about the powers of the legislature. But in the last resort it is the courts that define the sovereignty of Parliament, not Parliament itself. In those circumstances, is it really very helpful to add subsection (3) to the amendment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I think that it is inaccurate to say that the sovereignty of Parliament is a creation of the courts. It is something that is certainly recognised by the courts, but it is a constitutional principle. It was recognised by Dicey, as is well known, and by many <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1228"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other distinguished constitutional lawyers since. There have been questions about whether there is a limit to the sovereignty of Parliament and, if so, what that is.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>The intention behind subsection (3), and why it is necessary to include it, is that, as I said in my speech earlier, there is the possibility that at some time we might get a major conflict&#151;which could have happened on the ouster clause in the asylum Bill&#151;between the courts and the Government about whether the courts were bound to recognise the sovereignty of Parliament and the legitimacy of decisions made by Parliament. It seemed desirable that the question should be left as open after this Bill as it was before. I did not want any conclusion to be drawn that, because there was a specific reference in this Bill to upholding the rule of law, therefore parliamentary sovereignty was in any way less than it would be if this Bill were not passed. I hope that that is an adequate explanation of why I included this particular amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   As we appear to be debating Clause 19, having listened to what the noble Lord has said, I cannot see the slightest justification for retaining subsection (3). It does not make any sense at all. 
</p>




<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   As a non-committee member and a non-lawyer, I am a little puzzled over the difficulty about the rule of law. Are we not simply asking Ministers of the Crown to do what we ask the wearer of the Crown to do when we say, &quot;May she uphold our laws&quot; and perhaps adding <i>sotto voce</i>, &quot;Until you are able to change them&quot;? That is what it comes down to. It is for Parliament to see whether the laws are changed or not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   There appear to be two separate issues as regards the clause with which we shall have to grapple over the next few days in Committee. The first is whether it should be enforceable. That is dealt with in later amendments. The second is the content. At one level one might say that, constitutionally, the rule of law deals with issues such as the ouster clause; or one might posit an unlikely set of circumstances in which Parliament passed an Act limiting the franchise of the electorate. Those are two circumstances in which the courts might decide that the fundamental nature of the common law constitution was undermined by the sovereignty of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>At the other end of the scale it might be said that a defendant&#039;s rights in a criminal trial form part of the rule of law. I am rather attracted to that argument because it seems to me that the weakest point of the European Convention on Human Rights relates to the rights of the accused in a criminal trial. That arises, I believe, because we in this country have a very different system of criminal litigation to that on the Continent. There the protections are in my view at a much lower level. Therefore, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights is not much help, for example, when governments introduce proposals about propensity evidence to be led by the prosecution.

I heard with interest the views of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, and of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who rightly identified a possible weakness in the positioning of the amendment. Nevertheless, I believe that the expression &quot;rule of law&quot; has to come somewhere. I shall be interested to hear what the Lord Chancellor says about it.

<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="40713-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   This is an important issue which I do not believe we can resolve tonight. We have always been particularly concerned to ensure that our constitutional reforms in no way dilute the rule of law as a fundamental principle of the United Kingdom constitution. On the contrary, we believe that the overall effect of the reform should and will be to strengthen the constitutional principle of the rule of law by entrenching the independence of the judiciary and ensuring increased clarity and transparency in judicial and ministerial rules.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>Members of the Select Committee who considered the Bill considered amendments similar to those before us. They also considered a government amendment. I have not tabled that amendment again as I first wished to listen to the views of Members of this Committee on what principles they believed an addition to the Bill on the rule of law should encompass.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>Noble Lords have already raised the importance of ensuring that the rule of law continues to be upheld, but before we get to the detail of such an amendment, perhaps I may seek to establish clearly what the objectives are that we are seeking to address in this Bill. It seems to me that there are a number of key principles that ought to guide us in our consideration of this issue, excepting as I do that there should be a reference to the rule of law in the Bill. The principles are as follows.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>First, in referring to the rule of law in the Bill, we ought to be seeking to ensure that the responsibilities in regard to the rule of law currently discharged by the Lord Chancellor are, after the change or abolition of that office&#151;whatever may happen in the future&#151;still discharged within government.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Secondly, the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor or the office holder in regard to the rule of law arise, I believe, from his or her ministerial responsibilities for the justice system. Thirdly, we must accept that other Ministers of the Crown have responsibilities in regard to the rule of law; for example, the simple proposition that they must abide by the decisions of the courts. But the Lord Chancellor, or whatever the office holder may be called, because of his responsibilities for the justice system and their importance for the rule of law, has a special position within the Cabinet and within the executive.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>Fourthly, the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor or office holder in regard to the rule of law are not and should not be a matter for enforcement by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1230"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the courts. They are discharged in the Cabinet and in the executive through his position there and his influence in discussion with his colleagues. The operation of Cabinet government is central to our constitution and we should not be seeking to change that in the Bill by imposing a duty that would fall to be discharged in Cabinet, but that could be subject to judicial review going to the merits of the action taken or not taken by the office holder.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>Fifthly&#151;and this is why I think that in terms of principle, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is right in his third subsection&#151;any provision we add to the Bill should not in any way restrict the ability of Ministers or others to put proposals before Parliament on which Parliament can then decide.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>Finally, any provision we add to the Bill must properly take account of the roles of persons other than Ministers in regard to the rule of law, and not undermine their&#151;the other person&#039;s&#151;proper responsibilities. It is not the purpose of this Bill to codify the roles of all persons with responsibilities for the rule of law in our constitution. The danger of codifying some and not others is that we would upset the delicate balance that currently exists, which is not defined and could not be satisfactorily defined, in statute.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>A further general point about the rule of law which I think must guide our deliberations is that the rule of law is not itself a directly applicable legal rule, but a description of the status that the law as a whole should be accorded within our constitutional system. It informs the content, interpretation and application of the law, as the courts have often said in, for example, cases involving Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. But the rule of law is not and never has been of itself a standalone legal doctrine. It does not by itself form a directly applicable part of the law, so the courts could not at present declare actions to be illegal solely on the ground that they were contrary to the rule of law. If the rule of law is engaged, there must be some specific legal rule that gives expression to it before the courts can intervene. Any amendment that did not take account of this distinction would have constitutional effects reaching far beyond the subject matter of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>It follows from the above principles that any provision in the Bill on the rule of law should seek to provide reassurance that the existing position in relation to the rule of law is preserved while avoiding wider constitutional effects. It should preserve the balance in our constitutional arrangements while demonstrating the continuity and providing the clarity that noble Lords both on the Select Committee and in this Committee have been rightly anxious to secure with respect to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>Before proceeding to the detail of the amendments I would like to make one further point which I think is highly relevant and was touched upon by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, but which is frequently overlooked.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1231"></a>

</p>

<a name="40713-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>The point is that securing the independence of the judiciary forms a very substantial part of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s current role in upholding the rule of law and of Clause 1 of the Bill. The starting point for any attempt to define what is the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role with respect to the rule of law must be his ministerial responsibility for the justice system. Fundamental to this is the need for an independent and impartial judiciary. The centrality of that need to the rule of law is something that all commentators on the topic agree upon.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>That substantial part of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in upholding the rule of law has already been referred to in Clause 1 of the Bill. The duties imposed represent a very substantial strengthening of the protection for judicial independence by comparison with the present position. Not only is the current role of the Lord Chancellor in securing judicial independence placed in a statute for the first time, it is also extended to all government Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>The task in hand in relation to the rule of law in the Bill is therefore to define what additional role the Lord Chancellor has in relation to the rule of law, over and above the question of judicial independence, and to provide for continuity with that role after the office is changed. It seems to me that many of the differences&#151;if there are differences&#151;between the Government&#039;s position and that of others in your Lordships&#039; House, and many of the difficulties we have identified with the amendments now before us, can be traced back to this point.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para17"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>The Select Committee that examined this Bill was able to agree on a number of significant areas with respect to the rule of law, although perhaps these areas have received less attention than the areas of disagreement. For that reason, the Committee was able to agree easily that it is desirable for the Bill to make reference to the rule of law. We also agreed, first, that the reference to the rule of law should replicate as far as possible the responsibilities in regard to the rule of law currently discharged by the Lord Chancellor. Secondly, we agreed that, while other Ministers have responsibilities in regard to the rule of law, the Lord Chancellor has and should continue to have a special role in relation to the rule of law within the Cabinet. Most of the Committee, though not all, agreed that this duty is not and should not be directly enforced through the courts, but stems from his position in Cabinet and is exercised by way of his influence in discussions with colleagues.

<a name="40713-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>The simplicity of the amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, at first seems alluring. Indeed, my initial inclination was exactly the same as his. At the outset it appeared that achieving our objectives would simply require a reference to the rule <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1232"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of law to be added to Clause 1 of the Bill, as this amendment seeks to do. However, closer scrutiny has revealed some fundamental problems.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>As I have said, the rule of law denotes a state of affairs in which, in the event of conflict, the law has paramount force and effect in relation to any persons, institutions, interests, values, customs, practices, and so forth. It is not a directly applicable legal principle but a description of the status that the law as a whole should be accorded within our constitutional system. It can inform the content, interpretation and application of the law, but is not itself a directly applicable part of the law.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>This amendment would remove that distinction and make the rule of law into a directly applicable legal doctrine, binding on certain individuals. On one interpretation, it would require those individuals to ensure that a constitutional state of affairs, that is, the supremacy of law, prevails in all circumstances. On another, it would require them to act in accordance with a standard determining the legality of their actions and possibly to enforce that standard in relation to the actions of others.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>On either interpretation, the amendment is unsatisfactory for three main reasons. First, the amendment could not work because the content of the principle of the rule of law is controversial, with opposing views having been expressed over time by judges, academics, politicians, and practitioners. So individuals could never know with certainty what was required of them. Secondly, the amendment treats in identical terms roles that are fundamentally different.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>At present, the rule of law is upheld&#151;that is, the supremacy of law is secured&#151;primarily by the courts. The prominence of their role follows from the fact that it is they who have the authority to interpret the law and authorise its enforcement against all persons, including against the Government.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>Others, too, have roles in upholding the rule of law. The nature, extent and content of these roles varies considerably and has developed gradually over centuries as part of the process of constitutional development. Parliament ultimately has the power to make or unmake any law. The Attorney-General advises the Government on the law and represents the public interest before the courts. The police prevent and investigate criminal behaviour to ensure that the criminal law is enforced. The legal profession advises and represents individuals, corporations and governments in their dealings with the courts and with each other. This helps to ensure that the law prevails in private dealings, in police investigations and in court proceedings. Ministers are required to obey the law but do not generally have any direct role in enforcing the law against others.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>None of these roles is presently defined as such in statute although the relative positions of some of the players are buttressed by specific statutory or common law rules&#151;such as, for example, the provisions in the Act of Settlement about the removal of judges. They are all different in nature and content. They fit together to form the overall structure of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1233"></a>

constitution and ensure the status of the law within it. None of them amounts to a comprehensive duty to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in all respects. No one in our present constitutional system has such a duty.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>Seeking to impose upon Ministers of the Crown and all with responsibility for the administration of justice an unqualified statutory duty to uphold the rule of law, which is the effect of Amendment No. 3, fails to recognise that none of these persons would be in a position by themselves to ensure that the rule of law is upheld even within the limits of their own constitutional roles. It also fails to recognise that the status of the law within the constitution can only be guaranteed as the net effect of different independent roles that complement and, at the same time, act as checks and balances upon each other. Making each and every one of these persons comprehensive guardians of the rule of law in identical terms, which is the effect of Amendment No. 3, would ignore these distinctions and impose a duty on each that he would find himself unable to fulfil.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>The Lord Chancellor has certainly never been subject to such an undifferentiated duty. As I have said before, we have already improved upon the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in defending judicial independence in Clause 1 by giving it statutory expression in unqualified terms and extending it to all Ministers of the Crown. That is an important advance. The issue we are grappling with now is to define and give expression to what else the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in relation to the rule of law comprises.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>I very much thank the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Maclennan, for their amendment. It is an interesting and thoughtful attempt to come to grips with the complexity of this matter. The approach suggested in their amendment is much more in line with the principles that I have already set out as key to our consideration of this important issue. The amendment appears to have considerable merit but I wish to consider the draft further. I believe that, as it stands, the draft does not quite address some of the concerns I have raised in relation to the other amendment on the rule of law of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, that we have debated.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>As drafted, the proposed subsection (1) could give rise to considerable legal uncertainty&#151;there is a difficulty about what is meant by the rule of law&#151;but, as I said, I accept that the words &quot;the rule of law&quot; have to go into the Bill somewhere. The amendment that I proposed to the Select Committee referred to the rule of law as an existing principle. The intention was to make it clear that whatever is agreed as encompassing the rule of law now is the principle that we are seeking to safeguard in the future in order to provide as much certainty as possible. I am concerned that the unqualified mention of the rule of law&#151;that is, without reference to the word &quot;existing&quot;&#151;as per the amendment would not provide this clarity or certainty.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>I also have some concerns that unless the Bill makes clear that it is the existing principle of the rule of law that is to continue, the provision could be interpreted <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1234"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as creating a new constitutional principle. I think we all agree that we are seeking to replicate an existing principle.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>Subsection (2) of the amendment causes some difficulty in its use of the term &quot;respect&quot;. I remain unsure what is meant by this term in this context and what its effects in practice are intended to be. More importantly, I am not sure how the courts, if it were ever to come to it, would interpret the term. That uncertainty is reflected in the fact that, as far as I am aware, a statutory obligation to respect something is hitherto unknown in primary legislation. When dealing with a contested and potentially fluid concept such as the rule, I have reservations about introducing more uncertainty of terminology.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>I also have some misgivings as to whether the amendment appropriately takes into account other important constitutional principles. We must be very careful not to disturb the balance of existing constitutional principles, as I have gone through before. I accept that proposed new subsection (3) seeks to acknowledge the sovereignty of Parliament, but there are other principles whose status under the proposed text would need to be considered very carefully.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>There is no doubt, as I have said, that we need to introduce provision in relation to the rule of law. I remain committed to bringing in an amendment to ensure that the rule of law continues to be upheld. I have listened carefully to the debate and will seek better to understand the views of the whole House before tabling an amendment of my own at a later stage. That later stage will be while the Bill goes through this House.
</p>

<a name="40713-28_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>No written constitution, to my knowledge, has a provision imposing general obligations to uphold the rule of law. Given the nature of the principle, and the complexities and subtleties of its application, that is perhaps unsurprising. That highlights the scale of the task before us, and the importance&#151;as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, and the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, said&#151;of not rushing ahead and of ensuring that we get this provision right. I hope that in those circumstances the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="40713-29_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   Can the noble and learned Lord be a little more specific about what he intends to happen if the amendment is not now pressed? He said that he would bring forward an amendment at some later stage of the Bill before it leaves this House. In the light of our previous experience, as vividly described by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, I am afraid that we want something more categorical.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para0"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="40713-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Windlesham: </b>   The response of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, was in two parts, almost audibly so. There were his own extempore reactions for the first three or four minutes and then the Government&#039;s prepared response, which he was naturally bound by, but treated with a fairly free hand. There was generosity in those replies. The importance of rule of law is clearly recognised by the Minister, as well it should be. It is a question of how that primacy can best be reflected in the Bill. We can take encouragement from what has been said, particularly in the last few minutes of his reply.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>The short debate was also notable for the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. If I may say so to her, and to Members of the Committee, there are few people who have done more to encourage the growth of human rights in their public career&#151;hers is a very long public career&#151;than she has, irrespective of the Benches on which she was sitting at the time. Her contribution was a most important one. We value it and thank her.

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="40713-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton </b>   moved Amendment No. 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>Page 1, line 7, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Subsection (1) does not impose any duty which it would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament to impose. 

<br>
(   )   A person is not subject to the duty imposed by subsection (1) if he is subject to the duty imposed by section 1(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c. 26).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_211"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendments Nos. 14, 90, 91 and 98 are grouped with this amendment. These amendments address two issues relating to the extent of Clause 1. First, we have concluded that in one sense the present drafting is too narrow. As it stands, the duty is confined to the territory of England and Wales only. It could therefore be argued that it applies only to the actions of Ministers and others that take place within the physical limits of England and Wales. It could also be argued that the judiciary other than that of England <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1236"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1236</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and Wales fall outside the scope of the protection afforded by the duty. It would not include the justices of the new Supreme Court, the judiciary of Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the judiciary of international courts and tribunals.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>Secondly, we think that the drafting is too broad in another respect&#151;it does not take account of the positions of the devolved administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The scope of the clause needs to be narrowed to take account of that.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>The effect of the amendments in this group is as follows. The territorial extent of Clause 1 will be the whole of the United Kingdom. Clause 1 will remain binding on Ministers of the Crown and all with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary or otherwise to the administration of justice. The clause will not impose any duty that could be imposed by the Scottish Parliament. It will not, therefore, infringe on the competence of that Parliament. That is in line with the unanimous views expressed by the Select Committee. Those bound by the parallel provisions in Section 1 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which already contains provision in relation to continued judicial independence and to which my Amendment No. 17 refers, will not be bound by the existing Clause 1 duty. As both duties will be co-extensive, the effect of being bound by either one of them will be the same.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>I believe that this approach accords with the opinion of the Select Committee on these issues. But, I should spell out one aspect of the amendments that could, at first blush, appear not to be in line with the opinion of the committee. The Government, respecting the devolution settlement, fully accept that Clause 1 should not bind Ministers of the Scottish Executive and their officials, or otherwise operate within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. My Amendment No. 4 achieves that. However, the Government believe that the object of Clause 1 should be all of the judiciary of the United Kingdom, including the judiciary of England and Wales, of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. It must be right that the responsibilities of UK Ministers should cover all members of the judiciary in the UK. That said, Amendment No. 4 makes it clear that it will be for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether, and if so what, duties in this area are appropriate for the Scottish Executive. I would note that the approach taken by these amendments has been agreed with those in the devolved assemblies.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>Amendment No. 98 limits the territorial extent of Clauses 2, 4 and 5 to England and Wales only; those clauses deal with the judicial posts in England and Wales. I would also note that Amendment No. 14 defines the &quot;judiciary&quot;. As well as covering all members of the UK judiciary, the amendment will cover the judiciary of any court or tribunal which exercises functions of a judicial nature in pursuance of any international agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party or any resolution of the Security Council or General Assembly of the United Nations. That would include the International Court of Justice, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1237"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1237</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court, the European Court of Justice and Court of First Instance and the European Court of Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 make it clear that the term &quot;Minister of the Crown&quot;, as used in Clause 1, follows the definition in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;holder of an office in Her Majesty&#039;s Government in the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>That makes it clear that Ministers of the Scottish Executive are not caught by the clause. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40713-29_spnew5"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I need a little clarification. Not being a lawyer or having gone into all the findings of the Select Committee, is it right that the Scottish Parliament has no role in relation to the independence of the judiciary? I see from the Scotland Act that the existence of the High Court and the Court of Session is reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament at Schedule 5, under reservations to the constitution. I believe that the salaries and pensions of judges are also reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament under financial and economic matters.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>Perhaps the Scots are not totally excluded because I believe that in certain circumstances, Scottish Ministers are Ministers of the Crown. There is a stipulation under Section 52:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;Statutory functions of the Scottish Ministers, the First Minister or the Lord Advocate shall be exercisable on behalf of Her Majesty&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>I am not sure whether that means that they rate as Ministers of the Crown and, as such, have a responsibility for the independence of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>Under Clause 53:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;The functions . . . so far as they are exercisable within devolved competence, [shall] be exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by a Minister of the Crown&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>It seems to me that it is not the Scottish Parliament that has to do with the independence of the judiciary, but perhaps some Scottish Ministers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40713-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   First, Ministers of the Crown do not include members of the Scottish executive. Secondly, the Scottish Parliament has legislative responsibility for a measure similar to Clause 1 in so far as it affects Ministers of a Scottish Parliament or the Scottish executive. That is why we have not included them in the provision.
</p>

<a name="40713-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>Thirdly, the reservations in the Scotland Act, to which the noble Duke referred, relate to the existence of the Court of Session only, and this has nothing to do with the existence of the Court of Session. Justice is devolved, which is why if there were a duty that Scottish Ministers should be prevented from interfering with the independence of the judiciary, it would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament, not this Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>In relation to the changes that we have made, we have done two things.

<a name="40713-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Cullen of Whitekirk: </b>   I wonder whether I may make a few comments on Clause 1 as affected by Amendments Nos. 4 and 14.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for pursuing the objective to which the amendments are directed. It is clear that, even if one proceeds on the basis of the opinion expressed by the Select Committee report that it should be left to the Scottish Parliament to impose on Scottish Ministers duties similar to those in Clause 1, there would still be an anomaly in that Ministers of the Crown and other persons who have responsibilities throughout the United Kingdom would be subject to Clause 1 duties only as regards England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>Amendment No. 14, along with a consequential amendment to Clause 109(1) which deals with extent, are designed to fill that gap.

<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>The terms of Amendment No. 4 do not impose any duty which would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament to impose. I appreciate the difficulty in devising a form of words that leaves a Minister or other responsible person in no doubt as to when he or she is subject to a duty under the clause, as it would be amended. It may be possible to improve the wording. No doubt that can be discussed in due course.

From the wording of the Bill, it is clear that financial support directions can be issued to an associate of, or a person connected with, an employer that is a service company or that is insufficiently resourced. The use of those definitions from insolvency law gives the regulator incredibly wide powers. It comes under my heading of &quot;draconian&quot;&#151;the word that I used at Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The regulator would not only have power to serve financial support directions on any company in the same group as the employer and any shareholder that owned more than a third of the employer&#039;s shares but would also have power to issue financial support directions to associates of directors and shadow directors of the employer.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The full class of connected persons and associates seems very widely drawn and rather oddly random. It would include the company&#039;s employees and, in theory, even the nanny of the managing director&#039;s children. I know that that is a silliness, but I am advised that, in theory, such a person could be included. It would also include the current business partners of, for example, an ex-wife who divorced the finance director 30 years ago. Yet it might not include a 30 per cent shareholder of the company, and that clearly is important.

</p>

<a name="40713-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The impact of these clauses is to cut across the concept of corporate limited liability and to deter companies from investing in companies with defined benefit pension plans. For example, an acquisitive company that has an interest in many concerns will probably have a significant number of defined benefit pension plans operating in the group. If any of those are underfunded and the employers cannot meet a prescribed percentage of the Section 75 debt, the company will be liable to receive financial support directions. Broadly, if financial support directions are received, all the companies in the group will have to agree to be responsible for the affected employer&#039;s pension plan, the holding company must agree to be liable for that pension plan, or additional resources must be provided, because that is what it is all about.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The provisions will, in particular, act as a disincentive to a potential buyer of the company in difficulty. There has been much about that recently in the press, and I am sure that Members of the Committee will have seen numerous articles in the <i>Financial Times</i>, the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Guardian</i> and so on.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The potential buyer will probably either insist on an asset purchase, leaving the pension plan behind with the shell company as the employer, or walk away from the deal; otherwise, other companies already in the   buyer&#039;s group are likely to have to take on the purchased company&#039;s pension liabilities, and the directors themselves could be served with financial support directions.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>However, even the asset sale may not be able to go ahead in order to save the business. If there is an asset sale, the regulator might find that the only reason for structuring the sale in this way is to prevent a Section 75 debt becoming due. That would be the result of the structure if the struggling company had participated in a multi-employer pension plan. If the regulator found that such a structure was not in good faith, even if it might save the business, the seller would be exposed to the threat of a contribution notice, which I accept we have already covered. If the seller was an insolvency practitioner, even the slightest possibility of receiving such a notice would be unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Another issue would be the ease with which the companies could raise capital or borrow money. When a company does not itself operate a defined benefit pension plan but where there is such a plan in the group, the possibility will always exist that the company will be required to fund that pension plan. That will impact on the ability of companies to invest in future growth and will therefore impact on jobs in the United Kingdom, as this country becomes even less competitive. Figures for that were given to us in the Chamber only yesterday. We are aware that similar provisions have been introduced in the United States. Since they have been operative, defined benefit pension plans have become almost as rare as hen&#039;s teeth in all but the largest unionised companies. These measures are likely to have exactly the same effect.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>I do not know what, if any, thinking is going on in the department regarding Clause 39. However, at the very least, the potential recipients of a financial <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

support direction should be limited from the wide group perhaps caught by the current wording. Recipients should be limited to persons with a strong link either with the scheme or the company. Where the employer is not a service company, the potential recipients should be limited to scheme employers or companies controlling the relevant employer. Where the relevant employer is a service company, the recipient can also be a person who benefits from the employment services provided by that company. There is no justification for holding other persons liable for the relevant employer&#039;s liability to the scheme. Those other persons who, as I said, may be caught by the current wording of the Bill may not even be aware of the existence of the pension scheme.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Two other amendments have been grouped with this one. I prefer to reserve my comments on them until after they have been spoken to. For the moment, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40713-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   At least, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that this is a significant clause. It enables the regulator to bolster a pension scheme&#039;s viability and to do that by a suitable arrangement of financial support. When I first read Amendment No. 116, I thought it was helpful and was intended to clarify subsection (5), but it turns out that it is narrower than subsection (5), which refers to people who are connected with or are associates of the employer.
</p>

<a name="40713-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Page 22 of the Explanatory Notes suggests that persons,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;connected or associated with the employer . . . will include members of the same company group, controlling shareholders, directors, and the owners of unincorporated businesses&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I am not sure why the noble Lord wishes to exclude controlling directors from helping to bolster the scheme, if the regulator thinks that is necessary for the benefit of the scheme. So it seems to me that this is an attempt&#151;as indeed are certain other amendments that we are yet to discuss&#151;either to hobble the regulator or to narrow his options. I think that probably would be undesirable considering the practical benefits of the clause.

<a name="40713-31_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </b>  I am grateful for the contribution of my noble friend Lord Borrie. I agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has said. This is clearly not meant to be a clause to catch nannies. In so far as technically it might be read in that way, this is clearly&#151;as with a lot of our discussions at the end of our previous sitting on moral hazard&#151;an issue we shall wish to revisit to clarify the wording and any ambiguity. But, as my noble friend said, it revisits the issue of moral hazard.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>As it is a key tool, it may be worth taking a moment to explain the purpose of a financial support direction, the provisions of which are contained in Clauses 39 to 46. The purpose of the directions is to ensure that there is a guarantee of pension liabilities in circumstances in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which employers have attached their pension schemes to service companies or companies with very few assets. Although most employers who have done that have perfectly legitimate reasons for doing so&#151;we made it clear last time that we were not in any sense trying to inhibit legitimate mergers and acquisitions that keep an otherwise ailing company, possibly at risk of closing, afloat&#151;and have no intention of avoiding their pension liabilities, we have to ensure that the majority are protected from unscrupulous minorities who seek to invent ways of taking away the assets but dumping the liabilities&#151;almost shell companies, whether or not they are service companies.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>We therefore propose to give the regulator the power to ensure that, when a scheme is underfunded and attached to a service company or an insufficiently resourced company&#151;this is where a company is part of a collective group&#151;any pension promises are underwritten by other members of that group of companies. The thinking behind that is that obviously this is a debt that in all decency should be honoured as far as possible. A debt to the pension scheme is as much a debt as a debt to the suppliers of the company that is being acquired and should not be treated in any less favourable way.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Much of the talk seems to suggest that somehow pension liabilities are an encumbrance that gets in the way of doing useful things. That is unfortunate because those pension debts are moneys owed to the employees who have earned them legitimately, honestly and honourably. I am sure that there is no dispute in the Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, it is a question of trying to keep the balance right. I am willing to be persuaded that we may need to revisit each clause to see whether we have got the balance right. However, that we need some such provision seems to me to be without doubt. I am sure that the Committee will agree that, in general terms, sponsoring employers of pension schemes should be genuine entities carrying on a material trading activity or holding material assets so that the employer guarantee of the scheme is meaningful.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I shall give the Committee a real example, although not with real names. I am happy to disclose on Privy Council terms should the Committee wish. One of the examples I was going to use was recognised and pre-identified by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, so it may be that this case may also be one such. Spunoff plc is a subsidiary of the Vast Group. Its employees were formerly employed by Vast plc or other members of the Vast Group and formerly participated in the Vast Group pension scheme. When Spunoff plc was created, employees were moved into it from throughout the Vast Group and a new pension scheme was created, the Spunoff pension scheme. Since its creation, Spunoff plc has been rapidly run into the ground, although not wound up, and there is a &#163;25 million deficit in the Spunoff scheme. As I said, this is a real case.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Vast Group has so far refused to make up the deficit and has also refused to permit the members to transfer back into the Vast Group pension scheme, although that is still under negotiation. This would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC241"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a situation in which I believe, and I suspect all Members of the Committee would believe, that it would be appropriate for a financial support direction to be issued to ensure that the Vast Group stood behind the Spunoff pension scheme.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I would point out that this is one of a range of powers the regulator has and one that is at the extreme end, where all other steps so far have failed to persuade a company to honour a promise that it could and should make and which it is seeking artificially to avoid. If, despite being attached to a service company, the scheme trustees and employer have in place appropriate funding arrangements or a concrete and realisable recovery plan, and the employer and parent company are committed to supporting the pension scheme, the regulator would monitor the situation rather than issue an FSD.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>These powers will be exercised only when it becomes apparent that the scheme is insufficiently funded and the employer, either because it was a service company or because it was extremely weak in comparison to other companies in the group, is unable or unwilling to put a concrete and realisable recovery plan in place to restore the funding position.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The regulator&#039;s first steps would be to work with the trustees and employer to look for ways to restore the funding position and get assurances as to the commitment to that scheme. In other words, there would be a presumption of good faith to start. It would be only when that had failed that the regulator would consider issuing a financial support direction. Such a direction can be issued to anyone connected or associated with the employer&#151;here I take the remonstrances of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. The regulator will have to consider this very carefully as it will have to consider who is in a position to put these arrangements in place. I have to say that it did not strike me that the nanny would be in a position to put those changes back in place.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>It may well be that the threat of that direction would be sufficient to encourage the parent company to commit to guaranteeing the funding on an ongoing basis. One option could be for companies to move the pension liabilities out of the weak scheme to a stronger one&#151;in other words, back to Vast from Spunoff&#151;or strengthen the company itself; that is, moving resources from Vast into Spunoff.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Those served with the direction would be given appropriate time to put in place appropriate arrangements. However, if this does not happen, there must be serious questions over the schemes&#039;&#151;and the scheme members&#039;&#151;future. That is why the regulator would issue a non-compliance contribution notice to anyone named in the direction. We discussed that on the previous occasion. Of course, it will not be appropriate for the regulator to issue a notice to all those named in the direction. Some individuals may have been named in the direction because they are in a position of influence and able to ensure the directions are put in place. However, it would not be appropriate then to seek to ensure that they contribute to the funding of the scheme.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC242"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Factors that the regulator must take into account are set out in Clause 42(4). We have discussed them. They comprise whether the person has taken reasonable steps to secure compliance with the financial support direction; the relationship that the   person has or has had with the employer; the relationship which the person has or has had with the parties to any arrangements put in place in accordance with the direction; and any connection or involvement that the person has or has had with the scheme and the financial circumstances of the person. We discussed all the considerations that the regulator would have in mind on the previous occasion. The regulator would take those factors into account as part of the reasonableness test.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The sum in the contribution notice as a maximum can be the Section 75 debt due or potentially due. However, the regulator could reduce that amount as we discussed on the previous occasion. For example, it may choose a sum which would then allow the employer to put a concrete and realisable recovery plan in place to restore funding within an appropriate timescale. To pay the Section 75 debt all at once might tip the scheme over, but a recovery plan over, say, three years might very well be acceptable and tolerable and keep the scheme and the members on a steady course.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40713-31_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40713-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The sum could also be reduced to take account of the financial position of those named in the notice. Therefore, there are plenty of safeguards. Before a financial support direction or a non-compliance contribution notice is issued, the regulator will send a warning notice to all those likely to be directly affected by any decision. It will set out the evidence it has, why it thinks it is reasonable to exercise the power and, if necessary, details of how any sum has been calculated. The directly affected parties will then be able to make representations&#151;either on paper or in person if they prefer&#151;to the Determinations Panel.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>If the Determinations Panel exercises one of the powers, directly affected parties could go beyond that&#151;again we discussed this briefly on the previous occasion&#151;and appeal to the Pensions Regulator tribunal, which is entirely independent, before the order or direction has effect. They can go beyond that. If they are not satisfied with that decision, they may seek permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on a point of law.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The amendments seek to clarify the category of person to whom the regulator can issue these directions. As I say, I am sympathetic to the points that the noble Lord made. I have taken some time over my reply as it is the first time that we have discussed FSDs. I thought that it was worth putting those comments on the record to enable people outside to see what our intentions are in that regard. As I mentioned, over the summer we shall continue working with the various interested parties to ensure that these concerns are met.

<a name="40713-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>It may be appropriate to mention that at the end of our previous day&#039;s discussion on the Bill I agreed to take away a number of concerns. I have listed them. I do not have sufficient copies for every Member of the Committee but I shall ensure that they are fully distributed. We are taking away for further consideration issues such as the contribution notice on an insolvency practitioner; whether it is reasonable to apply a retrospective time period; the clearance procedure guidance&#151;we shall produce an initial draft by Report; and industry codes&#151;we are waiting for the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to produce an example of those.

<a name="40713-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We are also considering contribution notices under Amendment No. 112. In addition&#151;this relates to amendments that we might discuss more fully&#151;the Committee may think that there is not much point in repeating the debate on financial support decisions which we have already had on contribution notices because in all these cases I am perfectly willing to take these issues away.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Meetings and discussions will take place over the summer on this bundle of related issues, including the one that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised. I understand from my officials that the first meeting scheduled with the organisations is expected to take place before the end of July. No one is wasting time on this. I hope very much that I shall be able to give a report to Members of the Committee before Report, following the summer discussions, to show how far we have been able to reach consensus with the industry. I ask the Committee not to push me further than that. We are seriously engaged with the organisations to see what we need to clarify, what issues we need to revisit, what we need to discuss and what would appropriately be contained in a code of practice, a code of guidance, a regulation and so on.
</p>

<a name="40713-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>In the light of that very lengthy explanation, for which, I hope, the Committee will forgive me, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, to withdraw the amendment. I also invite the Committee, if I may, not to move some of the amendments that have been tabled, as they repeat some of the territory that we have discussed. At this stage, I cannot take the Committee any further forward than I did at the end of the previous sitting.

previous sitting. However, I do not feel that they have got there yet, and I support the plea made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for clarity. In that context, I shall not go through the amendments line by line, but we look forward to the clarification that we expect.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I have one further point to make on the general topic. I agree with the noble Baroness that pension funds are not some minor irritant that gets in the way of a deal. That is often the tone of conversation on the issue. In particular, I refer to the remarks of Mr Philip Green, the tax exile from Monaco who is trying to take over Marks & Spencer. He described the attitude of the pension fund trustees as arrogant, rude, untimely and unhelpful. That was the pot calling the kettle black.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40713-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I accept the noble Baroness&#039;s invitation to speak now and shut up later, if that is all right.

<a name="40713-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I agree with everything that she said about the objectives of this part of the Bill and about what is to be achieved. However, I have some great reservations about possible side-effects.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>It seems reasonable to start with Mr Philip Green. As I understand it, the trustees of the fund have said that, if he takes over M&S with a very geared vehicle, they will change their investment policy. That will result in a current deficit of about &#163;250 million becoming a deficit of about &#163;2 billion. That is a thoroughly reasonable decision, given the way in which trustees consider such things or are coming to consider such things. Someone who asked the same question a few years ago would not have got the same answer from the trustees.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>It is a matter of fact with markets that, although you can reasonably project a rate of return for the equity market, you will, in any average 30-year period, underperform by 30 per cent about 30 per cent of the time. The ability of the employer to make up the deficit from cash flow, if the investments have gone wrong over that sort of timescale, is important to the interests of the scheme members. It seems right that trustees should react to the solvency of the sponsoring company by adjusting the expectations that go into their investment policy. That is in line with current thinking. However, there are substantial consequences. There is a substantial transfer of value from owners to pensioners. They will get substantially less for the companies that they are selling. That may be something that we want to achieve, and I suspect that it is an objective of the Bill to make sure that pensioners are looked after and that shareholders come second in the queue&#151;or certainly not first. We should accept that.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The board of M&S may think that that consideration is a convenient poison pill, but, if they consider the matter further, they will see that what we are introducing is a substantial mechanism. If an ordinary company starts to get into difficulties, the pension fund trustees will follow the precedent that has been set in such capital letters and say that they have to change their investment policy. So, the moment that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC245"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the company gets into difficulties, the pension fund starts to add to it, because it starts to change its investment policy. Anyone running a major defined benefit scheme will feel it standing behind them, and the moment that there is a downward slope in results or a dip in the balance sheet, the trustees will push. They will increase the rate of contribution. They will declare a deficit. Such a scheme will be extremely dangerous to run.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>As my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale says, unless we are careful this will result in the accelerated death of defined benefit schemes. They are becoming dangerous and powerful to live with. It will result in pension funds becoming more risk-averse generally, which is not the result we wish for nationally. We need our pension funds and our big investors to be prepared to take risks. It will also be compounded because leverage buyers have been good payers for companies, by and large, and if they are no longer in the market because they cannot take the pensions consequences, that will reduce the general value of equities, which will compound in terms of reducing the returns that are available from investment in equities.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>So, we need to look at the consequences of this carefully and decide whether we want to place that risk on the individual company&#151;on the individual set of trustees&#151;and effectively make them react to this change in circumstances by becoming risk-averse, or whether it would be better for the economy as a whole that we place the risk on the pension guarantee fund. We would be saying that employers as a whole should take the increased risk&#151;or, at least, where the balance should lie. The consequences emerge slowly. This particular problem is not really a consequence of the Bill. It goes back to the Pensions Act 1995 and maybe before. It takes a long time for such effects to work through, because the orthodoxy takes a long time to change and develop in the pension fund industry.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>One way or another, this move will have major consequences and its relevance to this part of the Bill is that trustees will be in a position to create a deficit where none appears to exist. As the circumstances of a company change or as it passes from the control of one person to another, a great deal of uncertainty is created regarding the transfer of a company. If one asked 3i about how it sees this matter, it would say that companies were dying and that companies have died because of the uncertainty and because they could not, under the Bill as it stands, see how they could make a deal with the pension trustees and say, &quot;Fine, if we invest in this company we will set such and such a contribution rate and that is the way that the pension fund will be run&quot;, because that arrangement could be overturned by the regulator. It would be caught by the retrospective provisions. Companies are now dying due to the current provisions in the Bill and the uncertainty that it creates.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Do we really want that to happen? There always will be a dilemma in a company that is doing badly, over how a scheme should run, between the interests of pensioners and keeping the company going. We must ask whether we have got this right. Looking at Clause 39 in particular, I find myself thinking that <br>&nbsp;<br>

perhaps I am watching an episode of &quot;DIY Disasters&quot;. We are hacking away at the roots of company law and the foundations of a joint stock company, which is limited liability. It creates losers.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Every time that a company goes down, people lose money through no fault of their own. But it has enabled the joint stock company to exist and flourish. How many bricks can we take from the foundations before there is a real problem? My suspicion is that we shall not even begin to see the problems that we are creating for 10 years. Maybe it is all right and maybe it is not, but I cannot find anyone who has really thought through the problem, but we are taking limited liability to pieces for pensioners.
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="40713-32_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40713-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>As my noble friend said, this can run through to shareholders. 3i is clear on the legal advice it has: it runs through to shareholders. If they invest in a company with a defined benefit scheme, they are liable. They cannot escape it. The whole business of dealing with a company which has any sort of difficulties, of putting more money in and rescuing it, where they are exposed to the risks of a company with a defined benefit scheme, becomes impossible because of the uncertainty. You cannot restrict your likely loss to the money you are putting in. Each time, your potential loss will be the whole of your assets.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We need to find ways of dealing with that. I do not think that the Bill is intended to destroy the basis of 3i and its competitors&#039; business. We talked about getting clearance under Clause 35. We need a mechanism for clearance under Clause 39 too. There needs to be a way in which someone who is taking on a company with a defined benefit scheme, acquiring it or putting themselves in a position where they are likely to be attacked can say, &quot;This is our maximum potential liability for pensions before such and such a date. This is how we can do a deal with the pension fund trustees so that they will not suddenly rush into gilts and create a deficit that will hold up in front of the regulator and the courts&quot;. Unless we do that, we shall have great difficulties.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>It will be difficult enough to do an audit of a company in a group. Once the Bill is passed, to sign off an audit you will have to know the state of the pension fund of every company that might bite back&#151;certainly all the companies in the group but also, probably, other companies owned by your major shareholder, because the group runs so wide. There are big liabilities that could come running at you. How that should be done and how audits should be signed off is quite a question. I have not yet found anyone who can answer that.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I suppose at the root of this lies the problem that we are moving on limited liability. We have long accepted that limited liability can be crossed when there is fault; that is, fraud or malfeasance. We have done that, and that is accepted. Clauses 34 and 35 take us to the point where it can be done by mistake, just by carelessness. You can do something as a trustee of a pension fund which makes you liable for all your assets just because <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

you did not realise that it could have those sort of consequences or that you should get clearance. There are plenty of pension funds which are not beautifully run.
</p>

<a name="40713-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>In Clause 39, we break limited liability without fault, without any involvement in what has been going on, without any fault anywhere. I know that there are companies which the noble Baroness described with which we all want to deal. Sainsbury&#039;s got into trouble and the Sainsbury family were presumably regarded as people whose personal assets could be gone after for the Sainsbury pension fund. That seems to me to be breaking the basis of limited liability in a way which would have very unfortunate consequences.

<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Perhaps I may respond briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I do not want to reopen the general discussion about getting the balance right. We have discussed that thoroughly. However, I want to make it clear that the clearance system with contributions that he rightly identified will also apply here. So, that should also help with financial support directions.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>However, the general point about which I would put up a red light relates to the noble Lord&#039;s somewhat vague comment that, where a company is going through a merger and acquisition and the pension fund is a liability it would quite like to duck, it should be able to dump it on the PPF. That means that you produce a moral hazard. It becomes in the company&#039;s interest to run the fund down on the grounds that other companies not in their group will pick up the cost by virtue of the levy. Frankly, that is unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>One of the regulator&#039;s jobs is to ensure that pension schemes enter the PPF if, and only if, the employer is insolvent and the scheme is underfunded and cannot meet its wind-up liabilities. Otherwise, it will lead to the situation I gave as an example on Second Reading. If employers can let the state pick up the bill for asbestosis, no employer will ever protect his employees from asbestosis. We are in exactly the same situation, and that is what the noble Lord is inviting us to do. I hope very much that the Committee will not agree. He would not have the support of the industry voices that I have heard for any scheme in which the last man standing will pick up the bill for all the other schemes that have been able to manipulate their liabilities on to the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Let me give that warning now. The noble Lord may not intend to go that far, but I cannot let him think that there is a solution in the PPF. We have to get the balance right. I do not think that any of us disagree, and we will work on that over the summer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I should like to add two or three brief points following the remarks of my noble friend Lord Lucas. I entirely agree with him that it will be a great pity if the Bill is inadvertently detrimental to companies introducing and maintaining defined benefit pension schemes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The defined benefit pension scheme, as has been operated by many British companies, is an excellent means of planning for retirement. Unfortunately, people entering the workplace today are less likely to be able to join one of these schemes than was the case when I entered the workplace. I am heartened to see that major companies such as Tesco have recently renewed their commitment to their defined benefit pension scheme, which has 130,000 members. That is very important.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>We need to be concerned about breaching the principle of limited liability, particularly in Clause 39. It is a delicate balance, as the Minister said, between giving the regulator too much unfettered power and creating a situation in which overseas investors are less likely to invest in British companies.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The Minister has said that she will look closely at industry representations. I hope that they will include those made by the British Venture Capital Association, which is clearly very concerned about this. It is particularly concerned about the effect on investors from United States companies. That slightly puzzled me; I am by no means an expert on the American set-up, but I understand that the PPF is, to some extent, modelled on an American equivalent. Is there any limit on what a company could be ordered to pay to make good, as in the United States model, or any compromise with the principle of limited liability?
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>However, I entirely agree with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that we have to make sure that Vast and Spunoff do not leave their pensioners in the lurch. I have had a very large number of letters from deferred pensioners belonging to companies that are not insolvent but are nevertheless going into wind-up. Some companies may still be trading or are better funded than those which are winding up their pension fund. I welcome the fact that they will be caught by this clause.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I know that the noble Baroness has said that she will come back later to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, but I agree with the first thoughts of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. It is clearer than what is presently in the Bill, and it catches just about everybody that it ought to catch.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I must clarify the point about the US. My understanding is correct: in the USA, there is joint and several liability in company schemes for DB schemes. So in the States the provision is already more widely drawn than would be the effect of these clauses&#151;and they still manage to invest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   But it stops with the shareholders. It runs within a group and stays there. It has been promised that the issue will be reviewed.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Perhaps I may press the noble Baroness on the matter of clearance under Clause 39. What is she thinking of clearing, and how?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The suggestion made on the previous occasion was that, where a company or group of companies proposed a merger or acquisition, such that it had implications for the viability or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC249"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC249</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

funding its pension scheme, we wanted to make a distinction between a legitimate merger and acquisition&#151;in which case, remedying that deficit might take three years, five years or whatever period the remedial plan might be agreed for&#151;and an artificial manipulation. Any company acting in &quot;good faith&quot; could go to the regulator and get the equivalent of planning permission that this was acceptable activity and that it would work co-operatively in order to produce a remediation of any situation affecting the pension scheme&#151;as opposed to assuming bad faith.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>That still leaves open the issue of whether the building control inspectors need to see whether you have done the work correctly. The point about the clearance is to ensure that companies which might be in the early stages of exploratory talks and which are clearly doing this in good faith to rescue the ailing companies the noble Lord was talking about could proceed knowing that they would not be hit by something out of the blue from the regulator, if they were handling the matter with propriety.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40713-33_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   After that discussion, what can I say but <i>mea culpa,</i> particularly for not speaking to my Amendment No. 119, which answers the question of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on what my ideas mean regarding control.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>My noble friend Lord Trenchard was right: we were trying to simplify things. I started this hare, as I am sure the Minister would call it, running because I had not understood from our discussions on the previous clauses that she intended to carry her consideration through to the whole of the ball game. Now that I have understood it, it makes life a lot easier.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>My Amendment No. 119 covers the Minister&#039;s illustration of the small company Spunoff owned by Vast. I am delighted to hear, which again I had not appreciated even after our discussions last week, that this form of direction was a matter of last resort. It is the final plank after one has gone through all the other activities of the regulator and indeed the activities of the good firm, to which reference has been made.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Lucas for his extensive support. Clearly, he shared my impression that each part of the Bill would be considered separately by the noble Baroness and her team over the summer. Now that we have that straight, we all understand, So that is brilliant.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The Minister mentioned the effect of the Bill. One understands that, but one does not want the unintended consequences of such an effect. I am sure that that will be part of her thinking over the summer.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Lastly, like the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, I am delighted to hear that the Minister will produce the results of her thinking before Report and, as she said to him, in good time so that we can consider it and decide whether we want to pursue this fox&#151;I will not use the hare again&#151;through further stages of the Bill. I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(6B)   The groups referred to in subsection (6A) are&#151;


<br>
(a)   companies owned by or owning the employer in a 100% shareholding relationship,


<br>
(b)   companies owned by or owning the employer in a 75% to 100% shareholding relationship,

(e)   directors of the company at the time the act or failure occurred to the extent that they or their associates have benefited from the act or failure,


<br>
(f)   associates of the directors only to the extent that they have benefited from the act or failure.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_21"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall be extremely brief, and I do not expect a substantive reply. On this occasion, I do mean this amendment, and I know why it is there. We saw it before, when it was in the wrong place.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The amendment suggests that there ought to be a hierarchy. There is no fault&#151;you ought to go after the company before you go after the directors. I hope that that gets factored into the conclusions.
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>There are a couple of other things I wanted to ask. If there are clearance procedures, where a company is in any sort of trouble, you will presumably have to get clearance every time you declare a dividend or pay a director&#151;all sorts of little things which involve the transfer of money to associated people. Clearly this applies to the big transactions, but if you declare a dividend, you are taking money from the company and giving it to the big shareholders or other companies. In a company which is in any sort of difficulties with its pension fund, you are doing something which may affect the interests of its pensioners. How will you get clearance for that large number of relatively small, day-to-day transactions?
</p>

<a name="40713-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Secondly, how will you deal with directors put on the board by venture capital companies where a company is known to be in difficulties? How will they be sure that their personal assets are not at risk if, despite their best endeavours, the company goes down and the pension fund is in deficit? I beg to move.

We have had an example, apparently, of directors asking if they would be liable if they accepted positions with employers with underfunded schemes.

The amendment would ensure that net income can be taken into account instead of net assets when the regulator is establishing the net <br>&nbsp;<br>

assets of both the sponsoring employer in relation to a scheme and of any connected or associated persons in determining whether an employer is insufficiently resourced.
</p>

<a name="40713-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The concept of net assets is based on the definition in Section 264(2) of the Companies Act 1985 which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;&#039;net assets&#039; means the aggregate of the company&#039;s assets less the aggregate of its liabilities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>We have allowed for this provision to be in regulations to allow for flexibility. The way in which employers&#039; assets and liabilities are assessed may need to change, due to differing factors or economic conditions which the regulator may need to take into account. We think that it is an appropriate concept and, as I said, of course a person&#039;s net income may be taken into account if it becomes necessary to impose a non-contribution compliance notice as part of their financial circumstances. So I am not sure how much difference there is between the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and myself, but I hope that, with that explanation, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="40713-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I support my noble friend in this amendment. The test of net assets is a static test at a point in time, something shown in a set of accounts. If you believe that sets of accounts show something very useful about a company, then you might believe that this test was useful. In fact, when looking at the worth of an employer to a pension fund, you need to look at its cash flow. I think that that was the idea behind the net income to which my noble friend referred.
</p>

<a name="40713-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This seems to be the wrong sort of test. We should be looking at the ability of the company&#151;the entity&#151;to generate the resources that would allow it to support the pension schemes concerned. The wording of the amendment may not be quite right, but when the Minister talked about the definition in the Companies Act, I genuinely felt that the wrong kind of test was being proposed.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I, too, have some sympathy with the amendment. Assets and income are not the same thing. In particular, the sort of companies which get into difficulties with their pension fund are often declining industrial companies where, in theory, although the assets might look very valuable, they are not in fact very realisable. So I think that it is worthwhile to have an element of considering cash flow as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Perhaps if we replaced the words &quot;net assets&quot; with &quot;resources&quot;, that would be a more general phrase which could encompass everything.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am perfectly willing to look at it. However, we may be misunderstanding the thrust.

individual company to pay. The clause is not about the requirement to pay&#151;if it were, I would take the point about cash resources as opposed to, say, large acres of contaminated land somewhere in the depths of the north, the east, the west or wherever.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Much of this will be done by regulations. As it stands, if we compare company with company, we need to know the assets and not just the cash flow. I am not even sure that the cash flow would necessarily be especially relevant in those circumstances. It is not a question of whether companies will pay, but of making comparisons between other groups in the sector within the group. This comes within that subset of the service company and the insufficiently resourced company.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>The noble Baroness said: I think that we will continue a little of the discussion that we have just had. This probing amendment would delete subsection (4), which deals with how net assets are to be determined. We want to get at the thinking behind the test of net assets.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The Minister spoke a moment ago about what was shown in the accounts. One of the questions I was going to ask was whether the accounting conventions used in the accounts would be used, and I think that she said that they would be. One consequence of that is that that will be sorted by whether there are valuations in the accounts, whether the historical cost convention has been used throughout or has been modified and, looking forward, whether the company has been following UK GAAP or has moved on to international financial reporting standards. You can get quite different measurements of net assets on those two bases.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>That is the provision in the context of using financial reports. I had hoped that the Minister would not rely on net assets being derived from sets of accounts&#151;that, instead, they would have been derived from normal valuation principles, which is when you look at cash flows again. The way in which the worth of net assets is determined is by looking at the discounted value of the cash flows or some alternative valuation methods.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I tabled the amendment to try and tease out what we are talking about here. It is important to understand that historical cost accounts&#151;the ones referred to under the Companies Act&#151;have severe limitations for the use of determining whether there are sufficient net assets to meet the possible debt that could arise. We may be illogically pulling into the net companies that have a perfectly good valuation, on the basis of their cash flow, but whose accounts show a particular position. Alternatively, we could be ignoring companies that appear to have assets but do not yield particularly good cash flows and are not particularly good backing for employer debt.

<a name="40713-35_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Baroness Lockwood): </b>  I must point out that, if the amendment is carried, I cannot call Amendment No. 120C, which will probably not be moved anyway.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The purpose of the clause is to define the meaning of &quot;service company&quot; and &quot;insufficiently resourced&quot;. In effect, an insufficiently resourced company is one that has insufficient net assets to pay a prescribed percentage of the estimated Section 75 full buy-out debt, although another connected or associated company may have sufficient net assets to do so. The test is designed to identify situations in which a company group has attached pension liabilities to one of the weakest companies in the group.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The amendment would remove the provision allowing the net assets of the connected or associated company to be determined, calculated and verified in a prescribed manner. The concept of net assets is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said&#151;I should have welcomed her to the Committee when I began&#151;based on the definition in Section 264 of the Companies Act 1985, which means that they are the difference between the assets and liabilities.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The purpose of having regulations to define net assets further is twofold. The clause allows the regulations to provide certainty for companies and the regulator about how net assets will be calculated. It also allows for flexibility. That is important because the way in which employers&#039; assets and liabilities are assessed may need to change, if economic conditions change. There will be consultation on regulations made under this clause.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I hope that, with that assurance, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I support what my noble friend said. We are after a concept that allows us to describe the ability of a company to support its debt to its pensioners or, in the case of subsection (3)(b), an associate&#039;s debt. That is not described by the phrase &quot;net assets&quot; in the Companies Act sense. Many companies go bust with enormous net assets, because their net assets are calculated on a going concern basis. When a company goes bust, the key figure is the amount that someone else will pay for those assets, and that is often nothing.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The balance-sheet total produced by accountants is not a good measure of a company&#039;s ultimate ability to deal with a debt. It is more of a cash-flow concept, as my noble friend said, which would be better expressed, if we are to use the phrase &quot;net assets&quot; by assessing net assets on a valuation basis. Someone who is running a newspaper, for instance, may have net assets that are close to zero. Someone running a regional newspaper may have no physical assets at all, but they will have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC256"></a>

wonderful cash flow. The balance sheet will look awful, but their ability to support a deficit of &#163;20 million on a pension fund may depend on only half a year&#039;s profit.
</p>

<a name="40713-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>It does not show on the balance sheet, if you use the accounting method; it must be a valuation method. I think that that is what my noble friend is saying: we need something that brings out the ability to deal with debt, particularly if, as set out in paragraph (b), someone else will carry the can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   We have taken advice on the matter, and we have had extensive discussions with the DTI. This is one of the issues on which we will consult before the regulations are made. The comments made by the noble Baroness may be helpful and may steer some of that discussion, but, so far, the measure appears to be appropriate, on the basis of the advice that we have received. If we need to clarify the intent of the regulations, we will, of course, take the matter forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40713-35_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply and my noble friend for his contribution to the debate. I shall keep my own counsel about whether I would have consulted the DTI on the correct way to measure net assets. With the amendment, I was trying to tease out the issues. They are important and are worth examining again, if we are to have a genuine measure.

</p>

<a name="40713-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The Minister said that it was right to have flexibility in regulations and that people could see how the measure was calculated. I have absolutely no problem with that. I have no problem with regulations being used. However, I am slightly concerned that a rational basis should be used, although the cost and benefit issue will need to be considered. The kind of valuations that I was discussing that involve cash flow are more complex although they reach an answer that is approximately correct rather than a very definitely wrong answer, which the Minister will get if she considers accounting type formulations. But doubtless we can return to this measure another time.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>The noble Lord said: This is purely a probing amendment because I simply do not understand the Bill here. Subsection (6) of Clause 40 on page 29 refers to,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>that is, Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995&#151;being &quot;disregarded&quot;. I confess to being somewhat more confused than usual on this issue. What on earth does it mean? Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 is headed, &quot;Deficiencies in the assets&quot;. In this Bill the phrase, &quot;insufficient resources&quot; is used. I assume that they mean the same thing. Therefore, I believe that that particular point is explained. But what is not explained, even in the Explanatory Notes, is that the word &quot;estimated&quot; does not appear anywhere in Section 75. Section 75 is all about real debts determined, calculated and verified by a prescribed person, as can clearly be seen in subsection (5) of that section. I repeat, why the disregard for something that does not exist?
</p>

<a name="40713-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The situation gets worse. If there is already a Section 75 debt and it is so badly calculated that the money due is insufficient to ensure the solvency of the scheme, that surely is the fault of OPRA, whose actions the regulator is taking over. Why, then, should the employer, however defined, be subject to a redetermination that would not occur post the handover? After all, there is nothing in Clause 39 to provide for cases of redetermination unless I have totally misunderstood the entire clause. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40713-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is absolutely right to identify this as quite a technical subsection. I am almost certain that I shall need to follow this up with him in writing. When I pressed for a similar explanation, I was given to understand that the measure prevents a company being held liable for debt twice over. The existing Section 75 debt may have changed by the time the further calculations are done. It may be lower or higher. Therefore, the new estimated Section 75 debt should displace it; otherwise, there may be no power to cancel the original one.
</p>

<a name="40713-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>To some extent, the measure seeks to take account of gaps in chronology in that subsequent measures may be put in place. That is the broad thrust of the measure.

I did say that I knew that I would risk incurring her wrath and I shall now do so. We are not talking about the earlier clauses but the financial support directions and when they can be issued in Clause 41, which determines the meaning of financial support. These amendments, in particular Amendment No. 125&#151;the others being paving amendments&#151;focus on two problem areas. One is where the employer is willing to pay and the other looks a little more at the degree of liability that can attach.
</p>

<a name="40713-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>New subsection (4)(a) does this by saying that the employer shall be treated as willing to continue funding the scheme so that the calculations under (3)(b) reflect that. I am not sure whether that was exactly the same as the issue debated before, but it seems reasonable that if the employer is prepared to continue to fund the scheme that it would not fall within the ambit of the financial support directions.
</p>

<a name="40713-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>New subsection (4)(b) takes a slightly different approach, because it ensures that a person&#039;s liability is restricted by a formula that will reflect the extent of the person&#039;s association with the employer, using an association percentage, dealt with later in Amendment No. 136 by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, which restricts liability, either by reference to an ownership or benefit connection. The two amendments try to constrain the way in which financial support directions can apply&#151;not to challenge the principles themselves, but to say that in certain situations they should not apply due to willingness to pay or that they would be constrained by reference to the connection between the person involved and the pension scheme.

In summary, the amendment moved by the noble Baroness limit the regulator&#039;s discretion in determining what financial arrangements the regulator can require a person to put in place where a party other than the employer triggers the wind up of the scheme and where the employer is willing to fund the scheme on an ongoing basis.

Obviously the guarantees cannot be enforced outside the EU as easily as they can inside the EU. In the case of Vast, another company in the group could be the ultimate guarantor.

<a name="40713-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This goes back to a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, fairly early in our proceedings&#151;possibly the first day of Committee&#151;with which I heartily agreed. He said, and we agreed, that the tighter the description on the face of the Bill, the easier it will be to get around it. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, thought that X and Y would not last for long because he could see ingenious ways of getting around it.
</p>

<a name="40713-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Regulations enable the regulator&#151;in this case, when dealing with financial support directions&#151;to produce regulations within the framework of the policy intent of the Bill without coming back via primary legislation. Many highly paid professionals will find ways of avoiding the encumbrance of some of the regulations, and the regulator may wish to catch them. Regulations are not only about prescribing detail; to some extent, they provide clothes that are too large for the Bill at the time but they produce something that the Bill can grow into as practices develop. This is such a situation.

<a name="40713-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I think I am grateful to the noble Baroness. Of course, I recall what I said during the first day of Committee.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Lord said: Much of the Bill is written in terms of a worst-case scenario, and it is absolutely right that it should be. However, I gather that pensions providers have decided a whole lot of rules for themselves. The amendment uses the term &quot;industry codes of practice&quot;, for want of a better expression. Those have already been given a nod and a wink from OPRA and there is no reason on earth why the regulator should not also recognise them. If they have been lived up to, the regulator will no doubt be far more lenient than if they have not. Obviously I have no problem with that; nor do I have a problem with the regulator becoming involved with industry in producing such codes of practice. So often the industry works faster than the Secretary of State, the department, the regulator or any quango or civil servant.

<a name="40713-37_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I circulated a little hand-list earlier. This amendment is identical to Amendment No. 112, which we discussed previously.

It is possible that others may have examples.

If there are any relevant codes&#151;we are not aware of any but that may reflect my lack of information on the subject&#151;we shall be glad to see them. My answer is exactly the same: if such circumstances exist, we shall be happy for them to be taken on board. However, we are not yet aware of such circumstances; nor have we received any evidence of them. But I am happy to receive them if there are any.

</p>

<a name="40713-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The amendments deal with Clause 43, but I am discussing whether these matters are covered by the discretion given to the regulator in subsection (4) of Clause 42. Should the regulator take account of willingness to pay and the nature of the connection between the person to whom the notice is to be issued and the debt, or should that be left wholly to the regulator&#039;s discretion?

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40713-37_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I wish to make a distinction between who is triggering the wind-up and whether the scheme is in wind-up. When determining the amount of liability imposed by the contribution notice, the regulator will have to take into account whether the scheme is in wind-up or subject to an assessment period. However, it is irrelevant who decided to wind up the scheme. For it to be otherwise would be to penalise members.
</p>

<a name="40713-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I believe that many of the noble Baroness&#039;s remarks deal with a pre-wind-up situation. I wonder whether that is the difference between us. Clearly the regulator is anxious to ensure that the pension promise is met for employees. If the company is solvent and it suits the parties concerned to wind it up in the sense that a full buy-out of liabilities can be met, that may be the appropriate way forward. If that wind-up has been generated by some other party, that is irrelevant. What matters is whether the wind-up is the best way of protecting the employees&#039; interests, not who triggered it.

</p>

<a name="40713-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Given that, I am not sure that there is all that much between us. Clearly, if the regulator believes that it is in the best interests of the company to continue the scheme, the employer is willing to continue it and there is a reasonable funding contribution, that is fine. However, by the time you have gone into wind-up, it seems to me that you have already gone through that territory&#151;you are in the last stage. The regulator is seeking to ensure that the pension promise is met through the company being solvent and having the capacity to pay the liabilities that will possibly fall due&#151;in some cases many years hence&#151;by buying deferred annuities and so on, rather than that scheme coming to the PPF. I wonder how much difference there is between us. No one wants to wind up a scheme if it can continue. Equally, it may be appropriate to wind it up and protect the liabilities. The individuals may have moved on to another job knowing that that the scheme is secure because there is a deferred annuity.
</p>

<a name="40713-37_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>From our point of view, it does not matter who has triggered the wind up. Therefore, I wonder whether there is as much difference between us as the noble Baroness seems to think.

Based on the submissions that we have heard from outside parties, it is my understanding that it is likely to cause a problem for those who are happy to continue paying. It may well be the way in which the discretion is phrased, or it may not. I am happy to take this matter away and to see to what extent there is a difference between us.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that Amendment No. 131 is self-explanatory. It asks a very simple question, the background to which is that the object of the whole exercise is to bring a pension fund up to a state in which it is capable of fulfilling the promises that the rules of the scheme made to the miscellaneous employees. If it does that, no matter how it got into difficulty in the first place, I believe that no fine should be involved in the determination, and I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could tell me that that will be the case.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40713-38_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   We do not support the amendment. I should have thought that it would be very difficult to prove the exact amount of personal gain or to prove that it is detrimental to the scheme and a direct and intentional consequence. We think generally that this is fettering the regulator too much.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40713-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   That seems to be right. Under Clause 42, the regulator is already required to behave in a reasonable manner. The various provisions listed in subsection (4) include that he must take into account the financial circumstances of the person on whom the contribution notice is issued. I shall not read out the other points. It seems rather unnecessary to have this provision.

<a name="40713-38_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Those are my views precisely. We are not unsympathetic to the push behind this matter but we believe that it is adequately covered. The regulator must take into account, in particular, the degree of involvement in the act and the financial circumstances of the person. I think that we are back to Amendment No. 112. As I said, if the noble Lord thinks that there is an issue here which we have not picked up, I shall be happy to explore it, but we believe that it is simply not necessary.

The object of the exercise must surely be to make up the pension fund to a state at which it can live up to its promises. We have established that that is the last plank in the arrangements for it to be made to do so. Over and above that, is there to be a fine on the perpetrator? That is the question that I asked.

<a name="40713-39_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Essentially, there are two parts to Amendment No. 136, and I shall deal with them in reverse order. The second part deals with the percentage amount for which each individual person may be liable in the event that contribution notices or financial support directions are issued to more than one person in respect of the same debt.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I understand the concern behind the amendment. We will take it away over the summer but certainly at this stage we are not into the &quot;percentage game&quot;, as the noble Lord will understand perfectly well, so I shall not now go back over that territory. I understand the need for clarity and certainty as far as possible.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord intends this and obviously I can respond only to the amendments as drafted, but the proposed new subsections (4) and (5) in Amendment No. 136 would have the effect of ensuring that if the pension scheme of a solvent employer were to be wound up by a person other than the employer, the full buyout provisions would not apply to that employer.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I am sure that that cannot be what the noble Lord intends&#151;that by finding someone else to wind up the scheme you reduce your liability when there is a capacity to meet that liability. That is what the amendment does. Therefore, I have already said that the Government consider it entirely appropriate that a pension promise made should be a pension promise honoured. That is why we are introducing the PPF and the full buyout provisions on winding up when the sponsoring employer remains solvent so that liabilities do not inappropriately and unnecessarily fall on the PPF.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I am not sure whether the noble Lord&#039;s understanding of the amendment is the same as mine.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;The sum specified by the Regulator in a contribution notice may be either the whole or a specified part of the shortfall sum in relation to the scheme&quot;.</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="40713-39_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The reason that I was getting another file is because this clause is a consequence of Clause 47, which has already been agreed.

</p>

<a name="40713-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The clauses are designed to protect the pension protection fund against actions taken that reduce the assets in an eligible scheme which may, because of the insolvency of the employer, be taken into the PPF. Clause 47 allows the regulator to issue a restoration order directing that the position of the scheme be restored where that scheme has entered into a transaction at an undervalue within a two-year period leading up to an insolvency event, as set out in Clause 115, or an application notification under Clause 121.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC269</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>A transaction at an undervalue is exactly what it says&#151;a transaction involving scheme assets which results in the scheme receiving no consideration, or consideration which is less than the market value, in return. This could include, for example, trustees being persuaded to purchase a property on the basis of planning permission for a development which does not actually exist; or a director of a company persuading trustees to offer him a transfer on a very generous basis to prevent his benefits being reduced by the compensation cap, should the scheme enter the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Within insolvency legislation, there is currently provision retrospectively to undo transactions at an undervalue, involving company assets which occur in the run-up to insolvency. These clauses introduce similar provision in respect of transactions involving scheme assets in order both to protect the scheme members from having the assets of their scheme unfairly depleted and to guard against the possibility of the PPF having to assume responsibility for such schemes where it otherwise would not have done so.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The power to issue a restoration notice or order is reserved to the determinations panel and exercised by standard procedure. It is also subject to the powers to vary and revoke contained in Clause 95.

</p>

<a name="40713-39_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In line with Clauses 35 to 38, which give the regulator power to issue contribution notices where there has been evidence of avoidance of employer debt, the power to issue restoration orders where there is a scheme transaction at an undervalue will apply to actions taken after 11 June 2003 when the proposal to introduce the PPF was announced. This ensures that where a transaction at an undervalue has taken place since that date, when my right honourable friend the Secretary of State clearly warned that we would have to introduce protection against engineering designed to circumvent the intent of our proposals, the scheme&#039;s position can be restored. When we discussed a similar issue earlier, I was able to quote Mr Willetts and Mr Webb, who both endorsed the need to protect what is basically a closing-down sale before dealing with the situation.
</p>

<a name="40713-39_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>That is the point of the restoration orders. Clause 50 is, in that sense, pretty much consequential upon Clause 47. I wonder whether I have met the noble Lord&#039;s points by retrospectively revisiting Clause 47.

<a name="40713-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. As I have said several times, the trouble is that the Bill is drafted in such a topsy-turvy way that one is always looking backwards or forwards or, on many occasions such as during the passage of the Pensions Act 1995 or the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, looking sideways. Therefore, it seems sensible to take the clauses in the order in which they are set down in the Bill, wherever that may subsequently take us in relation to either the questions or the explanations.
</p>

<a name="40713-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I am not sure that the noble Baroness answered my primary question: what about instalments? They do not necessarily apply to a restoration order, but they do apply to the other orders that we have been discussing on these clauses.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40713-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Obviously, if it is possible to make good the shortfall in the scheme by a reasonable pattern of payments so that it is appropriately met, that is no problem. But it may be that, by this stage, we have gone past that moment. Bluntly, I think that the structure that we are setting up would fail if at the 59th minute of the 11th hour there was suddenly a capacity to pay by instalments. That issue should have formed part of the good-faith negotiations much earlier on either to prevent the scheme being wound up or to prevent the risk of the company becoming insolvent.
</p>

<a name="40713-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>In that sense, I am not sure that a question concerning a restoration order should be asked at this point, where a company is seeking artificially to reduce its assets by playing games with valuations or land or whatever so that it may then not need to go into the PPF. In various ways, we are seeking to gain access to other assets within the company group where appropriate under mergers and acquisitions or we are seeking to gain access to some of the assets&#151;for example, property such as land and so on&#151;into which the pension scheme money has been turned.
</p>

<a name="40713-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Although the lawyers will probably shout at me, at that stage, I would make an assumption of bad faith and of a deliberate running down of, or playing games with, available assets in order to reduce liabilities. Certainly, at that stage I should be quite surprised if the employer suddenly popped up and said, &quot;Oh well, we can make this good by instalments&quot;. If that discussion was decent and honourable, it should have occurred 17 or 18 stages further back down the line. However, I suppose that it is possible for that to happen and the regulator may believe that, as a result of either a merger or acquisition, the situation has changed and it is now reasonable to make instalments. However, the assumption here is that it is a once-and-for-all, make-good order. If the regulator had good grounds, presumably he would have the power to revisit the situation.
</p>

<a name="40713-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>On the question of timing raised by the noble Baroness, I may be able to add to the answer that I gave her. What counts as &quot;reasonable notice&quot; will depend on the circumstances. For example, if the transaction involved land, by definition, it might take time to turn the land into a realisable asset. Therefore, once the time for compliance has ended, the regulator may issue a non-contribution notice. That would not happen immediately as both those powers would have to be exercised with a determinations panel. Therefore a warning notice would be given.
</p>

<a name="40713-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The vocabulary that we continue to use includes the words &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;tight rope&quot; and so on. We are trying to ensure that we hold fast to the assets which should properly go into the scheme without them being disposed of. We are also trying to ensure that we provide enough time for the assets, which may have been disposed of, to be brought back into the scheme in order to meet its liabilities. Clearly, the length of time that that takes will depend on what type of asset the money has been&#151;I was going to say &quot;laundered&quot;&#151;transmogrified into.

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I think that this matter will have to be left to the judgment of the regulator. But I do not doubt that, if it is appropriate, the industry will encourage the regulator to consider codes of guidance&#151;in some cases, they may be codes of practice&#151;to describe some of the situations intended here. Behind all this is an assumption that the assets will have been deliberately run down. There are various ways to do that, and therefore the presumption is that we are not necessarily dealing with companies acting in good faith.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40713-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   In an attempt to be helpful but also brief, I have the feeling that the most obvious interpretation of subsection 50(3) is that the regulator on a once-and-for-all basis says either that the whole of the shortfall should be paid or that a specified part of it should be paid. I have been thinking about the more imaginative interpretation of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, since the moment he mentioned it, not having thought of it myself.

I do not think that he can then go on to specify a subsequent sum in addition to top up at some later stage. In my view, that would not preclude the regulator breaking down the pattern of payment if he thought it appropriate. However, it seems to me that it would be very unlikely at this stage that he would think it appropriate because that is the sort of discussion, in good faith, that should have gone on many stages earlier.

</p>

<a name="40713-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The application to the court can be made only in two circumstances.

<a name="40713-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale </b>   moved Amendment No. 139:

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I should apologise to the Committee that I did not spot earlier that somewhere along the line the words &quot;shall be&quot; have gone AWOL in Amendment No. 142. They should appear after the word &quot;Regulations&quot;. Amendments Nos. 139, 140 and 142 are grouped together. Amendments Nos. 139 and 140 are paving amendments for Amendment No. 142.

</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Am I still confusing the noble Baroness?
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. I do not have the amendment. I apologise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   In that case, I shall expand a little more than is my normal wont. Amendment No. 142 seeks at page 40, line 21, at end to insert a new subsection (7). There are two words missing, which are the words &quot;shall be&quot; after the word &quot;Regulations&quot; at the beginning of the new subsection. I had hoped that the office had informed the department of these amendments, or perhaps it guessed because clearly without the words the amendment does not make sense.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Two things concern me in Clause 55. First, subsection (1) only provides a power to regulate to enable inspection and so on of the register. I believe that there should be a duty to regulate to enable such inspection and so on in respect of the specific information mentioned in the last line of the amendment; that is, registrable information except for individual trustees&#039; or managers&#039; names and addresses.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Secondly, is there any reason why the names and addresses of individual trustees and managers under Section 54(2)(c) should be revealed? It seems to me that the regulations could well reveal potential terrorist targets, not obviously of the 9/11 type, but, for example, Huntingdon Life Sciences Company, where there was ongoing persecution by the animal rights lobby. I believe that one should think about the matter. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am again at a disadvantage. Certainly my understanding of Amendments Nos. 139, 140 and 142 does not conform to the speech made by the noble Lord. It may be useful if I spell out why the clause is drafted in this way and see whether that addresses the concerns of the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I introduced the amendment by saying that there should be a change from a power to a duty to regulate to enable the various things in <br>&nbsp;<br>

subsection (1) to take place. Perhaps the noble Baroness could explain what subsection (1) means and does. That would be helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Clause 55 provides the power for regulations to be made relating to the provision of information recorded in the register of pension schemes and extracts from the register or copies of the register. The Secretary of State may by virtue of this clause direct the regulator to produce reports, which may be published, concerning the information held in the register, including the operation of the regulator&#039;s functions in relation to the register. That will enable the Secretary of State to be provided with statistical information about pension provision generally and to inform and assist future policy development.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord is anxious about the Delegated Powers Committee. It was concerned with the provisions of subsection (3), which would enable regulations made under subsection (2) to modify Clause 76, relating to the disclosure of restricted information. Given that the noble Lord was concerned about the trustees of the Huntingdon Life Sciences Company and terrorists and so on, I sense that he might be.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>There is nothing sinister about the provision. The data protection rules continue to apply within the provision. The regulation-making powers in subsection (2) will enable the Secretary or State or his agent to provide a pension tracing service. This function is currently undertaken by OPRA in its role as the registrar of pension schemes. The service enables those who have lost touch with old pension schemes to trace them and to find out what additional pension provision is available to them. Last year OPRA succeeded in providing contact addresses for over 25,000 requests. The scheme is vital for helping individuals comprehensively to plan for and to make informed choice about their retirement.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Clause 76, quite rightly, imposes very strict controls over the ability of the regulator and to any person to whom the regulator has made an authorised disclosure of restricted information to disclose such information to any third party. Anyone who does so is guilty of a criminal offence. The Delegated Powers Committee thought this was an important safeguard.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The clause takes away the pension tracing service from what was OPRA, and would be the Pensions Regulator, into the DWP because we do not think that it sits sensibly with the other responsibilities of the Pensions Regulator. This connects with concerns in Part 4 of the Bill about planning for retirement, informed choice and so on.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Some of your Lordships were present when we looked at the informed choice retirement planner. Obviously, for that information one would need access to a pension tracing service so that people can bring <br>&nbsp;<br>

into play the available information on existing bits of deferred pension that they may have lost sight of some time previously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I was not actually going to ask about that. I thought I heard the noble Baroness say that this was not a suitable subject for the regulator. Therefore, it was being given to the organisation to be set up in the next part of the Bill. That surely cannot be right; I must have misheard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40713-41_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Or I may have misstated the position. The pension tracing service, which 25,000 people used OPRA for, is a very useful &quot;relatively low-level service&quot;. It may require a high degree of ingenuity. Nevertheless, we think it better sits with the Secretary of State&#039;s concern for information, retirement planning and all the other bits that come under Part 4 of the Bill, which we shall come on to discuss. I associated that with the retirement planner. I cannot remember whether that display was held in this Room. It had pretty slides and certainly interested the noble Lord, Lord Freeman.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>That is why we are removing the responsibility from the Pensions Regulator, who otherwise inherits the functions of OPRA, and bringing it over to the DWP. This is a tracing service, which in many ways is not dissimilar to finding out what one&#039;s national insurance contributions are, what one&#039;s entitlement is to state pension, how many years of added pension one has built up with SERPS or S2P and so on. It is at that level, and better provided by the DWP.
</p>

<a name="40713-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>We think that the costs will be fairly modest. It is a useful piece of&#151;I was going to say &quot;graffiti&quot;, but that is the wrong word&#151;low-level mechanical processing, which is best taken away from the regulator because, as the noble Lord will know, the function of the regulator is to seek to identify risk. OPRA has been bedevilled by the fact that it was required to carry on too much low-level activity, such as scheme returns coming in two or three days too late, which accounted for nearly half its complaints. We are trying to clear some of that stuff away from the Pensions Regulator. This is one such example, and nothing more than that.

<a name="40713-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I am not sure any more what the debate is between us. I think a misunderstanding may have occurred because perhaps there was not a full appreciation that the pension tracing service was coming over from OPRA to the department, for reasons I hope I have explained.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a simple amendment in the days of open and transparent government. As the noble Baroness knows, Clause 55(4) says that the Secretary of State can direct the regulator to make various reports to him. But subsection (6) merely says that the Secretary of State &quot;may&quot; publish any report submitted to him under subsection (4).
</p>

<a name="40713-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Amendment No. 141 deletes that permission to publish and replaces it with a requirement to lay any reports that the Secretary of State has directed before Parliament. I hope that we have not thrown the baby out with the bathwater and that laying the report before Parliament would not preclude any other form of publication. The principle behind the amendment is twofold: first, if the Secretary of State has gone to the trouble to direct the regulator to produce a report, why cannot Parliament see it as well? Secondly, publication should not be left to the discretion of the Secretary of State, but should flow naturally. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40713-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The noble Baroness is absolutely right to pick up the point about the discrepancy. The Secretary of State may by virtue of this clause direct the regulator to produce reports, which may be published, concerning the information held in the register&#151;surveys equivalent to those that GAD or NAPF produce. I hope that for the first time we shall have, providing the information is consistently recorded, a firm database on which to extrapolate information which may be of public interest. That may include the operation of the regulator&#039;s functions in relation the register. Up-to-date and detailed information from the register will be vital to future policy development.

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Obviously, there will be a presumption that publications will be laid before Parliament where appropriate. I think everyone would agree that the department has a good reputation for openness. But we could&#151;and this goes back to the point about the Huntingdon Life Sciences Company&#151;have a report that contains, for example, the names and addresses of trustees, which it would not be appropriate to make public. In that sense, it might not be appropriate to require the Secretary of State to make that report public, as the amendment would require.
</p>

<a name="40713-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>There could be an issue not only about data protection but also about protected information and so on. I think there is a line to be drawn. In practice, any report of the sort we seek to get from the regulator, which is the broader brush information and so on, will not only be laid before Parliament but&#151;as in the past with Pickering, the National Audit Office report on OPRA, the Quinquennial Review of OPRA and so on&#151;published and placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="40713-42_para8"></a>

</p>

<a name="40713-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>There are three sub-groups of amendments in this group. The first group, Amendments Nos. 144A, 144B and 144C, amend Clauses 65, 66 and 69 respectively to make them subject to Section 296. Clauses 65 and 66 concern the regulator issuing a notice to obtain reports or information. Clause 69 deals with the powers of inspectors when they inspect premises. Clause 296 is entitled, &quot;Protected Items&quot;, and deals with excluded items from disclosure or inspection, which are subject to legal privilege.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The amendments seek to make it clear in the Bill that the powers in Clauses 65, 66 and 69 are indeed subordinate to the provisions of Clause 296; that is to say that legal privilege will prevail in those instances.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Amendments Nos. 144D and 148A amend Clauses 70 and 72. Clause 70(6)(a) allows for the retention of documents that have been taken during an inspection of premises until the conclusion of proceedings, and Amendment No. 144D adds that such retention must be necessary and proportionate, otherwise documents that were not needed could be retained for the full period until the end of proceedings, and that would not be fair, in particular with businesses which may want access to their documents. Amendment No. 148A does the same to Clause 72, which deals with documents retained after being obtained by a warrant.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The last amendment in this group, Amendment No. 145, also deals with document possession under Clause 70 but here it inserts a new safeguard for the person from whom the documents are taken by requiring the inspector to sign for what he has taken. Ministers will be aware of the importance of documents to businesses. That will ensure that there is clarity about what has happened to documents. I hope that the Minister and, indeed, inspectors, would welcome some kind of formal procedure to avoid later disputes. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="40713-43_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. Clause 69 outlines the powers of the inspectors when inspecting premises. When an inspector enters premises which are liable to inspection he may make such examination and inquiry as may be necessary to the purpose for which the premises are entered. The inspector may take possession of any document appearing to be relevant to compliance with the regulatory provisions, or take any steps which appear necessary for preserving the document or preventing interference with it. He may also take copies of any document&#151;and, yes, he will sign for them so that there is a proper paper trail of such activity. To reassure noble Lords I should emphasise that we are talking about inspectors who are, in DWP terms, extremely senior&#151;Grade 7 civil servants or above, who are equivalent to fully qualified tax inspectors. So we are talking about a more modest level of seniority in exercising such powers.

</p>

<a name="40713-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Amendments Nos. 144A to 144C seek to ensure that the powers contained in these clauses shall not extend to the disclosure of protected items by adding to it the provisions contained in Clause 296 on protected items. Has the noble Baroness made the cross-reference with Clause 296? There it is made clear, regarding the matter upon which she pressed me, that protected items include,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;communications between a professional legal adviser, his client or any person representing his client which fall within subsection (3)&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>in connection with the giving of legal advice and so on. That should deal with the point made by the noble Baroness about protected information and legal advisers.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The phrase &quot;protected item&quot; relates to one that is subject to legal privilege; that is, any communication between a professional legal adviser and his client, or any person representing his client, which is made in connection with the giving of legal advice, and so on. However, this amendment is unnecessary as it seems to be fully covered by Clause 296.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Clause 70 provides additional provisions in respect of Clauses 67, 68 and 69. An inspector applying for admission to any premises for the purposes of this clause must produce his certificate of appointment if required to do so. Any document relevant to proceedings may be retained until the conclusion of those proceedings where proceedings are commenced before the end of the retention period of 12 months, otherwise to the end of the retention period. The regulator may extend the retention period.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>As drafted, Amendment No. 144D implies that the regulator may abuse its powers. An essential element of the work of the regulator is to focus on protecting the benefits of members of work-based pension schemes, concentrating its effort on schemes where it assumes or assesses that there is a high risk of fraud, bad governance or poor administration. Therefore, Clauses 67, 68 and 69, also prevent the regulator abusing its powers.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>In some situations it is appropriate for staff of the regulator to visit and inspect premises. These are powers that OPRA already has. It may be of interest for noble Lords to know that OPRA has made 12 unannounced visits per year since its inception in 1997. This is a power that is currently being used and I have not come across any suggestion that its powers have been abused. However, although OPRA was able to visit premises and inspect documents, it had no powers to seize or copy documents. That is a lacuna that should never have been permitted in the original legislation in 1995. I and my noble friends present also share culpability for not spotting that at that time. That lacuna has been remedied in Clause 69.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Amendment No. 145 seeks to ensure that any document seized by an inspector of the regulator will be detailed and an appropriate receipt given. That is what will happen. The regulator will follow best practice guidelines, contained, for example, in Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code B.

</p>

<a name="40713-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Clause 72 provides the regulator with the power to apply for a warrant to inspect premises in cases of suspected fraud or in serious breaches of pensions legislation which may have a significant impact on members&#039; benefits. OPRA currently has a similar power to apply for a warrant under Section 100 of the Pensions Act 1995, which it has exercised only 12 times since April 1997&#151;that is entry by use of a warrant as opposed to arriving unannounced. Each warrant that OPRA has applied for has been granted.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Like OPRA, the regulator will be able to apply for a warrant only in specific circumstances; for example, if it has requested information under Clause 66 that has not been provided, if there is a risk that requesting information would cause it to be destroyed, or if there is evidence of criminal activity.


</p>

<a name="40713-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Amendment No. 148A would appear to seek to ensure that any document taken from the premises should only be retained provided that retention was necessary and proportionate in the circumstances. The amendment has no purposeful effect because Clause 72 is very specific to the powers afforded to an inspector when a warrant is issued.
</p>

<a name="40713-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I hope that I have addressed all the issues raised by the noble Baroness in these amendments that cut across those clauses, but, if not, I am sure that she will press me further.

<a name="40713-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. Perhaps I may press her on one or two points of detail, although the drift of her comments is what we   were hoping to hear. First, she said that the inspectors would sign for documents. Under what authority would that arise, because it is not under the Bill? Would it apply as a matter of procedure?
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. In practice anyone who took documents without signing for them would be a fool, because there would be no record of where they had been obtained and there would be no paper trail that would stand up in court if a criminal process were to be pursued. Such a practice is required by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code B and the inspectors would abide by that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that. Does that code apply currently to the department&#039;s inspectors and will they apply to the inspectors who will be carrying out the regulator&#039;s functions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. The inspectors, who have quite a senior level of responsibility, will be required to sign for documents when they take them. If they do not there will be a serious question mark about the paper trail, because we are dealing with cases that may well go to court, if there has been a criminal offence at some stage. Obviously, such evidence would not stand up unless appropriate procedures had been followed, as laid down by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code B.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that. Of course, the answer was given by the Minister from the <br>&nbsp;<br>

perspective of preserving evidence. My question was asked in the context of preserving the company&#039;s ability to have some record of documents that had been taken from it so that it could ensure that it could retrieve those documents at a later stage. But I imagine that there would be some commonality of interest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Or copies made, for example.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Yes. The Minister also said that Amendments Nos. 144A to 144C were not necessary because of Clause 296. I was seeking an assurance that, from the Minister&#039;s perspective, Clause 296 overrides the earlier clauses, in effect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that. My last point related to Amendments Nos. 144D and 148A, which relate to the retaining of documents only if that retention is necessary and proportionate. The Minister spoke about regulators not abusing their powers, but then said that there would be a power to seize documents, which, presumably did not apply before. Having obtained the power to seize documents, should there not be something that says that one could not hold on to them for an unnecessary period? My point is that documents are often the lifeblood of a company. There may or may not be some wrongful act for which the company may be brought to book, but inspectors could enter premises and take away large amounts of documents, which could inhibit the way in which the company carried out its lawful business.
</p>

<a name="40713-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>While I completely understand that documents should be retained when they are needed for proceedings, the Bill does not say that the documents should be retained only for the purpose of proceedings. It says that, &quot;You can hang on to whatever you have managed to gather in for as long as the proceedings are going on&quot;. I believe that that should be restricted in some way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   If the documents are part of the lifeblood of the company&#151;and I realise that they might be in certain circumstances&#151;they could simply ask for the documents back. The regulator would keep a copy and send them back.

</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Perhaps I may ask a question about Clause 69. It is not clear to me whether subsection (2)(d) would give the power to remove or require a copy of a document which was encrypted. If that was the case, the inspector would not be able to say that the document appears to relate to compliance, because he would not know what the document was. If an encrypted directory on the computer was used for maintaining the pension scheme records, one could expect that there might be relevant matters in it. I cannot see how subsection (2)(d) would apply in that case. Does it and, if so, how? I do not need an answer now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I think that the noble Lord will end up with a bouquet of steeled wire. I should first compliment the ingenuity of his concern. I thought that I had prepared for all possible contingencies, but encrypted, protected, coded documents had not occurred to me. However, we can legally take information stored in any form, so there is no legal problem. There may be a problem of identifying whether information is relevant by virtue of it being encrypted. I understand that you do not know what you do not know. That is always a problem. But if you do know what you do not know, so to speak, then the information may be taken&#151;that is empowered under Clause 69(2)(e).
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="40713-44_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I do not think that that covers encrypted information because it cannot appear to be relevant. I think a &quot;might&quot; could be needed in the subsection.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Amendment No. 146 is a technical amendment to ensure that a warrant may not be issued solely on the basis that a document is on the premises which goes to compliance with the Northern Ireland equivalent of Clause 228&#151;obligations on employers to enable employees to obtain information and advice about pensions&#151;or solely on the basis that a person is liable to pay a civil penalty order in respect of a breach of the equivalent in Northern Ireland to Clause 228. Without these amendments, warrants could be issued in relation to those Northern Ireland provisions which would be out of step with the position regarding the equivalent GB provisions.

Not being able to take regulatory action or allow criminal behaviour to go unpunished, are equally unacceptable.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister to clarify what the amendment actually does. It seems to exclude from the ability to obtain a warrant documents relevant to compliance with Clause 228. I understood that the Minister&#039;s justification was, of course, on the basis that the regulator had to have the power to obtain the information and obtain a warrant, if needed. But my reading of the amendment is that new subsection (3) says that in subsection (1), which relates to a justice of the peace issuing a warrant, the reference in (3)(a) or (b) does not apply to any information required under Clause 228(3). I may be completely wrong, but my understanding of the amendment was that it achieved the opposite of her description.

</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Barker </b>   moved Amendment No. 149:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 54, line 10, after &quot;false&quot; insert &quot;or maliciously provides the Regulator with information which is misleading or likely to mislead&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment may seem pedantic, but I believe that it is important. Providing false or misleading information becomes an offence under the Bill. It is important to establish whether someone has knowingly and maliciously provided false information and whether they have knowingly and recklessly provided information which was misleading.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Secondly, how does one establish what is misleading information? Information can be misleading on the part of the person who provides it. Equally, it can be misleading to the person who receives it. The purpose of the amendments is to tighten that up when we are talking about a criminal offence.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>An assessment must be made about the likelihood of information being misleading and misunderstood by the recipient. In most cases, the recipient will be the regulator and the board; they will be highly equipped and will no doubt have easy access to a great deal of expert information. That may be different from those who are providing the information to them.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>We are seeking to spell out in slightly greater detail than is in the Bill the standards by which information should be assessed. Somebody could probably provide information in the belief that it was perfectly good, but it could mislead the regulator. So we are trying to ensure that we get to those who maliciously provide wrongful information and to establish greater legal certainty in taking into account the recipient of the information. It is a pedantic argument but quite an important one. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I oppose, quite strongly, the amendments presented on behalf of the Liberal Democrats by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. I feel that the present proposal, which is quite common form in legislation&#151;that a person who knowingly or recklessly provides the regulator with information which is either false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of an offence&#151;is perfectly reasonable. If you say that that is all right for false information but if, in relation to misleading information, you want to insert the words &quot;maliciously provides&quot;, I would say that that is a severe watering down of the provision for the offence and exceedingly difficult for anyone to establish. I think that the amendment should be rejected.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Amendment No. 151 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;information is misleading or likely to mislead only if it is misleading or likely to mislead when viewed in the light of the addressee of that information&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Of course, the addressee is the regulator. We have not yet determined whether it is &quot;he&quot; or &quot;it&quot;&#151;there are further amendments on that score. That presumably means that if the regulator should know that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC289</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

information is misleading, there is to be no offence. That seems to let off very lightly someone who may have knowingly or recklessly provided information which is misleading to many people but perhaps not to the knowledgeable regulator. Normally, one judges these matters objectively: is the information misleading or is it not? I believe that on all those counts the amendments should not be accepted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I feel like simply saying, &quot;I agree&quot; and sitting down again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   With him or with her?
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Absolutely not with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. It seemed to me that the response of my noble friend Lord Borrie was exactly right. I want to add one point. Clearly, the provision refers to the person giving the information, not to the degree of knowledge the regulator may or may not have, such as he could or could not be misled.

</p>

<a name="40713-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>It is for the regulator&#151;and this may give some assurance to the noble Baroness&#151;where there is a question not of bad faith but of honest doubt&#151;and we are all out to catch the bad faith cases, but there might, I suppose, be a question of honest doubt or inadequacy by the person giving the information&#151;to prove beyond reasonable doubt to a court that a person who provided false or misleading information did so knowingly or recklessly. That is a very high standard of proof. It is for the regulator to establish that in a criminal court.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>So, in addition to everything my noble friend Lord Borrie said, which seemed to me to be exactly right, I think the noble Baroness could have the comfort that there is actually a high hurdle for the regulator to establish were these consequences to flow.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I could not disagree more with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. Our reading of the clause as it stands without our amendment is that it is possible that information could be deemed to be misleading only if it were proven to have misled someone. Therefore, the supply of information which was in fact misleading but was never caught would fall without that. That is important. That is why we have inserted the provision about being,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;likely to mislead&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>My second point is&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   What distinction does the noble Baroness draw between misleading information and wrong information? It is like asking what colour is an orange in the dark. Does someone have to know it is wrong for it to be wrong in terms of the recipient?
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   That is exactly the point that we are trying to get at. We are trying to establish that there is a reciprocal duty of care on the recipient of information as there is on the provider of it.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The recipient in this case is largely the regulator.

<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40713-45_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Surely, it is not the regulator&#039;s duty to ensure that he is not misled; it is the duty of the person providing the information to ensure that he does not mislead the regulator. We may be dealing with thousands of schemes. We are seeking in the Bill to establish that the regulator may be able to, so to speak, take his eye off the vast majority of schemes where there is no significant issue of risk involved to members and to be able to concentrate&#151;we all agree&#151;his resources where there is real risk. To do that he has to be able to rely on the reliability, the accuracy and so on of the information presented to him.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Therefore, there is a duty of care on the person providing that information&#151;trustees or whatever or scheme professionals. It is not the job of the regulator to ask, &quot;Am I misled?&quot;, it is the duty of the person providing that information to ensure that, given all the guidance that has been put out and so on, the information is as clear as possible.
</p>

<a name="40713-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Having said that, the test of state of mind and of intention comes into play in the second stage of whether the information was indeed knowingly or recklessly misleading. That is where the test has to be established in a court of law.

<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40713-46_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   We were seeking to establish a test whereby someone provided information which was perfectly reasonable but where the regulator was misled in the context. It is, however, clearly a matter on which we shall have to go back and reflect. It is important to establish the level of responsibility the regulator has to make efforts to determine whether someone provided information with an intention to mislead or whether wrong information was given that was not intended to mislead.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40713-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In which case could we not stand up in the courts? That was the point I was trying to make. The backstop is there but he has to prove beyond reasonable doubt, not on the balance of probabilities. It is not a civil test; it is a criminal test, which is actually very high. Perhaps the noble Baroness can help me. Can she think of an example in which someone unwittingly&#151;if I can put it this way&#151;produced information which misled the regulator but, none the less, he could establish in court that that person should be subject to a criminal offence? I find it hard to conceive of any such example. Perhaps the noble Baroness has such an example in mind.

<a name="40713-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Two points occurred to me in relation to this clause. First, presumably the word &quot;valuation&quot; in subsection (2) means actuarial valuation in this case. Secondly, as regards subsection (3), it is important that the consultees should not divulge the information either. I hope that that is what all that means.

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The regulator is not prevented from disclosing information to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the Lord Advocate, a procurator fiscal or a constable. Neither is it prevented from disclosing restricted information where disclosure is required by law, or to a trustee&#151;this would be an independent trustee&#151;appointed by the regulator under Section 7 of the Pensions Act 1995 if the information is required by the trustee to carry out his work. The amendment adds to that provision in order to enable the disclosure of information to an independent trustee appointed by the regulator under Section 23 of the 1995 Act.

<a name="40713-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The ability to disclose information to any regulator-appointed trustee is an important one. OPRA does not currently have that power and, as a result, it is often aware of information extremely relevant to the trustee whom it appoints but which it is unable to disclose. Such information could vary from, for example, scheme bank account details to information about previous regulatory action in respect of the scheme in question. It seems absurd to appoint an independent trustee and he cannot be told about a previous investigation in respect of the scheme in question.

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>As I understand it, the Bill simplifies the existing requirements for IDR procedures principally by removing the requirement for a two-stage process and requiring only a single stage. As I understand it, this change is driven by simplification and a view that the present process is too complex and time-consuming. However, a single formal stage will realise these advantages only if it is supported by informal procedures. The amendment seeks to achieve that by requiring the regulator to produce a code of practice&#151;Clause 84 concerns codes of practice&#151;commending the use of informal procedures.

</p>

<a name="40713-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>This amendment is designed to ensure that the new pensions regulator takes the necessary direct measures to require companies to impose adequate systems of controls upon pension schemes.

</p>

<a name="40713-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>As I understand matters as they stand now, ensuring that strong systems of internal controls are in place in relation to a scheme&#039;s assets is to some extent the province of the Financial Services Authority, which is responsible <i>inter alia</i> for investment managers and insurers, to which most trustees entrust their asset management. However, trustees do have responsibilities to control their investments&#151;even where these are delegated&#151;and to make sure that the relevant administrative systems function properly.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The main purpose behind the amendment is to assist in the enforcement of proper controls, in particular in relation to money purchase schemes. The amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Lucas. We regularly hear from scheme auditors about how frequently they encounter poor internal controls in pension scheme administration systems. For those final salary schemes where the pension is calculated purely on the basis of final salary and years of service, the employer pays the balance of the costs so this may not be problematical for the member. In money purchase schemes, however, where the members&#039; benefits depend on the contributions and investment return thereon, it can be very damaging.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I anticipate that the Minister may want some examples. Typical problems that are encountered include incorrect contribution calculations. The wrong rate may be applied for a variety of reasons. The payroll may be misinformed or there may be a complex contribution structure, depending on member age and choices, and this may not be correctly applied.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Another typical problem is failure to pay sums on due dates, causing investment dates to be missed and failure to apply member investment choices. I have, for example, been informed of one administrator making a large compensation payment because it did not apply the switching arrangements for members within 10 years of retirement age when they were supposed to have a phased move from equities to bonds. The market falls in equities that have taken place meant that the members lost material sums from this failure.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>There may be failure to ensure that regular and frequent reconciliations are carried out between investment records and administration records. Otherwise, where discrepancies do arise between the two, investigation of differences is going to be very time consuming and expensive.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Finally, there may be failure to apply the correct rules and processes when unitising funds, so that the members are not given the correct number and value of units.

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>It is my contention that these problems could all be eliminated in the vast majority of instances by the application of strict and clearly established internal control processes.

correct. I am informed that too often auditors find that the necessary internal systems and disciplines are absent, which results in uncorrected errors. Because of the nature of money purchase schemes, these can rapidly snowball over time and be perpetuated.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Since money purchase schemes are rapidly supplanting final salary schemes, this has the potential to become a really serious problem. There is no provision for compensation for maladministration, so member protection has to be achieved by proper controls and a mechanism for enforcement. The potential for recovering compensation from administrators is likely to be very restricted.

<a name="40713-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>I should have preferred to give the Minister much more detail in advance. I apologise for the fact that I have not been able to do so. However, I understand that the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales has given examples in the past similar to those which I have specified. It has requested the addition of an extra code of practice under Clause 84 and also for a separate clause for the implementation of the European directive&#039;s provision in Article 14(1).

<a name="40713-47_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I am in total support of this amendment, which is not surprising given that I am a chartered accountant, and the amendment emanates from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Bill is doing a great deal for defined benefit schemes. We ought also to make sure that it does what is needed in terms of defined contribution schemes. So far as I can establish from the institute and from talking to other people, the problems are largely administrative. They are really quite extraordinary. These are complicated schemes because the arrangement is so flexible. You find that up to 20 per cent of schemes are not doing any reconciliations at all and are piling up all sorts of problems. I think of the incomplete records that I used to encounter when I was training to be an accountant.

We have one such example here which I believe has been explained.
</p>

<a name="40713-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Amendment No. 155 would apply the measure that we are discussing to money purchase schemes.

<a name="40713-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   My understanding is that there are obligations on companies to do this properly and the auditors can then check that they have done it.

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="40713-47_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I was talking about accountancy rather than the actuarial profession but perhaps we can blur that line. There is no reason for the regulator not to issue a code of practice if he thinks it is appropriate and desirable. Obviously he would respond to representations made to him by professionals or possibly trustees of schemes who feel that there is a need for guidance on the matter.

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>What we are resisting at this point is specifying in advance what codes of practice and so on the regulator should issue.

Be that as it may, should the measure prove necessary or desirable, people would be entirely free to persuade the regulator that this would be an appropriate code of practice. From what has been said, that may well be the case.

suggests that a matter should be covered by a code of practice, the Minister replies that the regulator might do that if he considers it necessary. What principles underpin the requirement of a code of practice? That might help others in knowing whether they could breach this particular defence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="40713-48_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am not entirely willing to help the noble Baroness breach our defences but none the less there is a point there. The point that I am making is that I am not sure why we need to approach the matter in the way that is suggested given the controls that already exist. Professionals in the field that we are discussing may tell me that I have misunderstood the situation. However, audited accounts are required for money purchase schemes.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The regulator will be able, via scheme returns, to identify schemes that do not have audited accounts and take appropriate action, for example through education, an improvement notice or a third party notice&#151;all the matters that we discussed on the first and second days of Committee. The Committee will know that we have already piloted scheme returns and that we have had very positive feedback I come back to professional standards. If the auditors are not satisfied, they do not sign off the accounts. If they do not sign off the accounts, at that point the regulator gets involved because there is clearly a problem. I ask in all honesty why that procedure should not be adequate to meet the problem identified by the Committee?
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40713-48_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Perhaps I can help the Minister. The auditors will sign off the accounts provided there is no material misstatement in them. An organisation could have pretty inadequate controls and procedures. It could be doing many of the things, such as paying moneys into investments late, to which my noble friend Lord Hunt referred, but the audited accounts could still be signed off because there is no material misstatement in them.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The Minister needs to understand the difference between what a set of financial statements does and what audited accounts convey as information, and what happens within an organisation in terms of the financial controls and procedures that are necessary to ensure that the operations produce the right result&#151;in this case for those who are beneficiaries of money purchase schemes.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I was originally disinclined to support my noble friends on this amendment because I wondered whether it was going a little too far. However, when the Minister said that the audited accounts are all that are needed, it seemed to me that perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the department of what information audited accounts convey. If that is not well understood within the department, the Minister&#039;s officials may want to reconsider whether there should be a provision on the face of the Bill regarding appropriate controls and procedures.

<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40713-48_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I also want to go back to the point about what we should specify, as mentioned by the noble Baroness. We are specifying <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC298"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC298</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that some codes of practice are both essential and mandatory. That applies to areas where legislation would impose obligations in general terms to do something within a reasonable time which would need to be amplified by codes of practice to be sufficiently clear and certain for practical purposes.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The noble Baroness asked what principles we had in mind regarding the requirement to have codes of practice. I refer to matters such as a notifiable event or a reasonable timescale. People need to understand what is meant by that. That is without prejudice to the regulator&#039;s general powers to issue codes relating to other obligations.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>I have no objection at all to asking officials to reconsider the matter, but I am slightly shocked by the noble Baroness&#039;s comments about the inability of auditors to ask the appropriate questions to satisfy themselves that it is appropriate to sign off accounts. Perhaps I am wrong to be shocked and perhaps it is reasonable for the auditors not to know about certain things. However, I am slightly puzzled. I am perfectly willing to do more research on the noble Baroness&#039;s concerns. I take seriously the point that people in the profession consider that they want tighter controls than the profession can exercise through the scrutiny of the relevant professional association.

the regulator should not have a code of conduct that he should follow. However, the point that I want the Minister to consider is whether or not the regulator should be giving guidance on the issue covered by the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Here, we are partly returning to the subject of contribution notices under Clause 35. That was debated extensively last week and I do not want to repeat what was said. The issue is whether or not the regulator should be giving guidance on commercial considerations. The example given here is whether it is acceptable for commercial reasons to structure a transaction as a business sale with a TUPE transfer, even though the company owning the business will not incur a Section 75 debt.

The example is whether it is acceptable, for commercial reasons, to structure a transaction as a business sale with a TUPE transfer, even though the company owning the business will not incur a Section 75 debt. The question is whether or not that is avoiding a debt. Therefore, the amendment also asks for examples of the acts which could trigger, or not trigger, a notice in order to help people to understand the implications of their actions.
</p>

<a name="40713-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The point is: how do we issue guidance on how, and to what degree, the regulator will take into account commercial considerations when deciding whether to issue a contribution notice so that those in the commercial world will know, in broad terms, whether what they are contemplating is or is not within the territory that is likely to cause a problem for the regulator? Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to get the regulator to issue guidance that others can look at in determining what kind of commercial considerations will be taken into account when approaching particular transactions&#151;that is, what would or would not or what may or may not be acceptable, depending on the circumstances.

</p>

<a name="40713-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>We know that codes of practice often impose costs. There is no problem with that, but costs have to be weighed in the balance with the benefits that would be produced. Regulatory burdens are the single issue most complained about by businesses large and small, whether we are talking to the Federation of Small Businesses or the Confederation of British Industry. The regulator&#039;s powers go beyond those currently held by OPRA. Therefore, we need to ensure that the legislation is mindful of the impact of any additional regulatory burden.

<a name="40713-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Against that background, Amendment No. 158 would amend Clause 84 so that any code of practice issued analyses the costs and benefits and so that we can have a proper public debate on that.

<a name="40713-49_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   They do not seem entirely reasonable to us. I am sorry to break this happy mood. I have a very practical argument. My best response is to go to what I am sure is bedside reading for Members of the Committee&#151;the Cabinet Office document entitled, <i>Better policy making: A guide to regulatory impact assessment</i>. It lays down the conditions under which one effectively carries out a cost-benefit analysis&#151;that is, a regulatory impact analysis. It was issued in 1998 and on page 6 it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;You do not need to do an RIA for proposals which impose no costs or no savings, or negligible costs, or savings on business, charities or the voluntary sector; increases in statutory fees . . . or road closure orders . . . However, even if you think the effects of your proposals are likely to be negligible, it is still good practice to produce an RIA. It is not always clear when a proposal is being formulated whether there will be any impact on business . . . Early consultation or informal soundings with your stakeholders will be particularly important in the situation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40713-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I can give the noble Baroness the assurance she wants. The regulator will follow these good practice guidelines for its codes of practice. So, clearly there is not much point going for a cost-benefit analysis where the costs of that are probably higher than the costs of the activity proposed. But where exactly the line is drawn in that scheme is shaped in these guidelines, which state, more or less, that where in doubt, there should be a cost-benefit analysis. I hope that the noble Baroness would think that that is a pragmatic and sensible way to proceed; that is, to follow the best practice guide.
</p>




<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="40713-49_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   It is always good practice to follow good practice guides, but would that always happen? The purpose of the amendment is to hard wire that requirement into the Act so that it is clear that the regulator really has to follow that. Clearly, if there are no cost benefits, it would take only one line in any draft regulations to say that there are no costs and no benefits, or no cost and some benefits, whatever is the case. So, it is not very onerous to state that in a draft being put out for consultation.
</p>

<a name="40713-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>That requirement is clearly specified in the FSMA. That Act imposed potentially very significant regulatory burdens on the financial services industry, for good reason. Nevertheless, it was considered important then&#151;by the Government, presumably&#151;to include it in the Act. I struggle to see why this Bill, which is pretty significant, with significant regulatory burdens inherent within it, should not also be explicit. I hope that the Minister might think about it again, or we may return to it on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40713-49_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I always prefer Members of the Committee if possible to speak to an amendment rather than to whether a clause should stand part. By specifying an amendment I know what concerns are being raised, and it gives me an opportunity to get a properly researched reply, which is then recorded in <i>Hansard</i>. I probably would also have the resources to go into any necessary full detail that may be helpful to people outside. If noble Lords debate whether a clause should stand part, it becomes a fishing trip. So I would invite the noble Lord to speak on Amendment No. 167 and I promise not to make rude remarks about retrospection.

(   )   in such a manner that provides a minimum period of twelve weeks for the submission of responses&quot;

<p><a name="st_239"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 164 and 166 are straightforward amendments. Amendment No. 164 is similar to one we discussed a moment ago. It tries to put into the Bill the Cabinet Office&#039;s code of practice on consultation to make sure that defined periods for consultation are allowed. The Financial Services Authority currently uses a period of 12 weeks. It would be curious if a lesser period was ever allowed under the Bill. So the regulator should be required to follow that period, especially as many of the players that the two will be communicating with are the same. Perhaps the Minister could explain whether there would ever be a case where a lesser period of consultation would be required. That might short-circuit some of our discussions.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>Amendment No. 166 is similar, but it omits the extremely wide-ranging power of the Secretary of State in Clause 85(4)(b) to do away with the requirement for consultation altogether. We are dealing with codes of practice that a certain class of people will have to comply with. We find it difficult to conceive of any circumstances where a code of practice could be imposed without any form of consultation. It is in the nature of codes of practice that they embody actions that are appropriate for individuals or classes of individuals or bodies.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Surely, the regulator should not be both the judge and jury of whether such codes are acceptable. We reject the possibility that the Secretary of State should ever find any reason of urgency to do away with the well known requirements for consultation on codes. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Certainly, we are expecting that codes of practice will be issued by the regulator only after ongoing consultation has taken place with the appropriate industry and with DWP policy representatives. We do not consider a formal, 12-week consultation period at the end of the process to be particularly justifiable, helpful or meaningful because much of it will have been front end-loaded in the development rather than back end-loaded with consultation taking place after the event.

</p>

<a name="40713-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>We shall be working to ensure a &quot;no-surprises&quot; approach by working with the industry on the development of the codes of practice. For example, where the Social Security Advisory Committee has consultation powers, in some cases it goes out to an unsuspecting audience and a formal consultation period is required. But where such a procedure is drawn up with the affected bodies, it can seem a little bizarre subsequently to consult them again at the end   of the process. That is why we are seeking flexibility.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>The only exception to consultation is where there is a need to issue a code as a matter or urgency and where consultation would be inexpedient. As the noble Baroness said, that provision is contained in Clause 85(4)(b). The next pensions liberation scam could be an example of the need to act very quickly. I do not think that the noble Baroness was with us when I tried to demonstrate to the Committee just how offensive some practices are. I gave the example of two men who received sentences of five and a half years between them. We had no sense of that scam until OPRA picked it up. Therefore, we assume that occasionally there may be the need for urgent procedures which bypass consultation, certainly for any defined period of time, although I would expect such occasions to be fairly rare. We do not want to tie ourselves to a specific timetable precisely because, as I said, consultation will have been built in at the beginning&#151;that is, at the development stage&#151;rather than the end.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Ultimately, we all need to buy into this. If consultation is appropriate after the development of the codes, it will take place then. But I do not want to tie us down to a period of 12 weeks. That may be three months of wasted time when all the parties have already agreed to the codes before the draft is in the public domain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I shall give it further thought when I have read it in <i>Hansard</i>.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>At this stage, I simply remark that it seems very inward to believe that just because one consults on the draft, one does not then need to have a consultation period which, by definition, lays the issue open to anyone who has an interest in it. It is a little arrogant to say that you do not need formal consultation periods because you know everyone who might be affected. I suggest to the Minister that that is a rather dangerous <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC305"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC305</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

path to follow. Proper periods of consultation should be included to allow things that the regulator might not know about to be brought forward. In addition, particular interests affected by a code of practice may not have been identified by the regulator.
</p>




<p><a name="st_242"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Is the noble Baroness saying that every code of practice must have a formal three-month consultation period at the end? That is what her amendment would achieve. I am not saying that there will not be consultation; it may be entirely appropriate for consultation to take place on the draft. We are trying to avoid tying ourselves automatically into a three-month period of consultation which may not be necessary. It may very often be necessary, and a longer period of consultation may often be necessary. I can conceive of a range of circumstances that may arise. I am asking whether the noble Baroness is really sure that she wants to require every code of practice, however it is developed and under whatever circumstances, to have three months of consultation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I think I am saying that the default period should be three months. The FSA is using a three-month period, as I outlined, and I can see no reason for not doing the same. I am concerned that we may be setting up a regulator who considers it normal to do far less than that or nothing at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   I would caution against this going into the Bill. Any regulator worth his salt will publish the rules by which he will operate. Surely&#151;I have done so myself&#151;those rules would state, &quot;We will normally expect to have a minimum of 12 weeks&quot;. There will be times when a longer period is needed, but the odd incident will arise where time is not on the regulator&#039;s side and he needs that flexibility. Therefore, I do not think that the Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC306"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column GC306</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is the place for such a measure. The regulator needs to take responsibility for operating properly and for publishing his normal guidelines for consultation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="40713-50_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for that response. I think that my approach is that these are codes of practice.
</p>

<a name="40713-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>I do not quite understand &quot;urgency&quot;. Earlier, the Minister gave the example of a scam, which I read about in <i>Hansard</i>. However, I am not clear that issuing a code of practice is necessarily the response which the regulator needs to make. The regulator needs to deal with that particular circumstance and needs to issue a press release, which says, &quot;This has happened and we are not having it happen again and, by the way, we might in due course ensure that our codes of practice reflect that whatever has happened is unacceptable behaviour&quot;. I am rather unimpressed by all this talk of urgency on codes of practice. However, I shall not labour the point today because we have gone past the witching hour for Grand Committee. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40713-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that I have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Adult Learning Inspectorate on behalf of the MoD. This MoU provides for the introduction of an agreed annual rolling programme of independent inspection, reinspection and oversight of defence training and education, including the welfare and duty of care provided within the training environment.

</p>

<a name="40713-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>In signing this, the MoD seeks to achieve:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>The implementation of quality assurance arrangements which guarantee high standards, meet MoD requirements, add value to the expenditure of public money and at least match the quality of comparable civilian learning programmes.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>The ability to have access to the national learning community to share good practice and benchmark defence training & education.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>The ability to maintain and update professional skills through continuous professional development activity in order to support the lifelong learning agenda and skills development in the MoD.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40713-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The MoD and ALI will work together to develop appropriate working arrangements to facilitate a suitable training and inspection programme that will complement existing internal quality assurance and improvement procedures of the armed services implemented through the defence systems approach to training quality standard (DSAT QS); a British Standards Institute accredited private standard.

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="40713-51_spmin4"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister for School Standards (Mr David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>This statement relates to school funding in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>In his Statement to the House on 29 October 2003 my right honourable friend the Secretary of State set out a package of measures designed to restore confidence in the school funding system and deliver stability in school budgets and predictability for head teachers and governors. These included a minimum increase in every school&#039;s budget; additional resources to help every LEA to support schools with additional pressures; the reversal of planned cuts in the Standards Fund; and targeted transitional support to help all schools to achieve balanced budgets. He explained that these arrangements would apply for the two years 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, but that the precise level at which the various elements would be set would be updated for 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Evidence from LEAs&#039; budget statements suggests that the measures put in place this year have been successful in restoring stability and predictability. In particular:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>the vast majority of authorities have passported the increase in their schools formula spending share to schools in full;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>overall, over two-thirds of schools received a funding increase above the level of the minimum guarantee. The remaining third received a funding increase in line with the minimum guarantee;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_11"></a>there is no significant difference in the number of schools receiving the guarantee by type of school (primary, secondary, special) or by size of school;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>the guarantee has been helpful in giving schools earlier information about the minimum level of their budget to aid planning and to provide stability and predictability; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>the limit on central spend by LEAs has helped to maximise schools&#039; own budgets, while allowing for special circumstances in some authorities.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40713-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>We now need to look ahead to 2005&#150;06. One of the things that authorities and schools have been telling us over the past year is that they would welcome earlier announcements from central government in order to enable them to plan ahead effectively. I am pleased <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS54"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column WS54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

therefore to be able to make this announcement over three months earlier than the equivalent announcement last year.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>As in 2004&#150;05, our starting point has been an analysis of the cost pressures which will face schools in 2005&#150;06. My officials have discussed these cost pressures&#151;including increases in teachers&#039; pay and support staff pay and pensions&#151;in detail with local government representatives and the head teacher associations. Excluding the costs of workforce reform, to which I will return, our best estimate is that cost pressures on the average school in 2005&#150;06 will be in the range from 3.8 per cent to 4 per cent. There remain some uncertainties, in particular around the cost of local government pensions, which will impact unevenly on authorities.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>We have also considered the costs of the implementation of the national agreement on workforce reform. Earlier in the year, with the support of our partners, we undertook a survey of schools in six LEAs to get a better understanding of their starting points, how they plan to deliver the workforce reforms and to what extent this can be achieved through the redeployment of existing resources. I am grateful to all those LEAs and schools for their help.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>This work confirms that the pressures of workforce reform, and in particular guaranteed time for planning, preparation and assessment, will impact mainly on primary and nursery schools in 2005&#150;06. The precise cost for individual schools will, of course, depend on the strategies chosen to implement the reforms and the amount of time that needs to be created, but we expect the average cost pressure to be between 0.8 and 1 per cent for primary and nursery schools. The survey also indicates that most secondary and special schools will be able to implement the September 2005 contractual changes from their existing resources. We recognise that some secondary and special schools may incur additional costs, and will undertake further work with our partners during the autumn term to examine the nature and extent of these costs, including in particular the transfer of exam invigilation from teachers. It will be for schools and LEAs to take forward the results of this work through workforce remodelling and through the headroom provided under the arrangements I am announcing today.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Of course, remodelling is not just about extra funding. We will continue to work with our partners, the National Remodelling Team and the network of LEA remodelling advisers and consultant leaders to offer guidance and support for all schools in implementing workforce reform. In particular, we will examine the support required by schools to manage effectively the transfer of exam invigilation from teachers from September 2005.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Our priority for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 has been stability in school budgets, and in 2005&#150;06 all schools will therefore continue to have a guaranteed minimum funding increase which is at least equal to the average cost pressures which schools are likely to face. However, I also believe that it is important to retain <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS55"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column WS55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

flexibility for LEAs to respond to local circumstances by directing additional resources where they are most needed, especially since the costs of workforce reform will vary significantly between schools depending on their starting point.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>Against that background, I have decided that in 2005&#150;06 the minimum guarantee should again be set at 4 per cent for secondary schools. As in 2004&#150;05, this means that pupil-led elements of schools&#039; budgets will increase by 4 per cent per pupil, and fixed elements by 4 per cent in cash. A secondary school whose pupil numbers stay the same between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 will therefore be guaranteed at least a 4 per cent per pupil increase in its overall budget next year, on top of a minimum increase of 4 per cent this year. Secondary schools whose pupil numbers decline will receive an increase of more than 4 per cent per pupil, to help to cover their fixed costs. And those whose pupil numbers rise will receive at least a 4 per cent increase in their cash budgets, and an overall per pupil increase of at least 3.9 per cent.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>For primary schools, I have decided that the minimum guarantee should be set higher, at 5 per cent, to take account of the additional costs which these schools face in implementing workforce reform. Primary schools whose pupil numbers remain unchanged will therefore receive at least a 5 per cent per pupil increase, and those with declining numbers will receive more than 5 per cent. Those with rising rolls will receive at least a 5 per cent cash increase in their budgets, and an overall per pupil increase of at least 4.9 per cent. As with 2004&#150;05, special arrangements will apply to schools with 75 pupils or fewer.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The available evidence suggests that most special schools will be able to implement the national agreement on workforce reform at no net cost, though as I have mentioned we will do more work on this with our partners during the autumn term. Where costs arise they are likely to be very uneven across schools, and it is therefore more appropriate to deal with them by targeting LEA resources rather than through a higher minimum guarantee. The guarantee for special schools will therefore be set at 4 per cent for 2005&#150;06. The special arrangements that applied to the calculation of the guarantee for special schools will continue in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Nursery schools received delegated budgets for the first time in 2004&#150;05 and therefore no guarantee applied to them this year. We have agreed with our partners that the cost pressures on nursery schools are likely to be similar to those on primary schools in 2005&#150;06 and therefore the guarantee will be set at 5 per cent for them. LEAs will be able to choose, in consultation with nursery schools, whether to operate the standard pupil-led form of the guarantee for nursery schools or a place-led version like that for special schools, depending on how their nursery schools are currently funded.

</p>

<a name="40713-51_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>All of these figures are the minimum increase in funding which schools of each type will receive in 2005&#150;06. As with 2004&#150;05, we expect the majority of schools to receive an increase which is higher than the minimum guarantee.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>Our work with LEAs on the cost of workforce reform also suggested that the costs of implementing the national agreement are likely to be highest for very small schools&#151;those with under 100 pupils. The main reason for this is that it can be more difficult for a very small school to secure small proportions of support staff time in order to release teachers for planning, preparation and assessment time. In urban areas schools can collaborate to resolve these difficulties, but that can be harder to do in rural areas where travelling distances are greater. Subject to consultation, I therefore propose to apply a larger increase to the sparsity unit cost in the primary formula within the schools formula spending share, to direct more resources to authorities with a high proportion of schools in this situation. I am also doubling the announced increase in the school standards grant band for schools with under 100 pupils, to ensure that all small schools have some extra help with the costs of workforce reform.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>In October the Secretary of State promised that the income schools receive from the school standards grant and the Standards Fund would be uprated in line with the minimum guarantee in both 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, and the Learning and Skills Council promised to do the same for school sixth form provision. I can confirm today that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>Standards Fund support for schools will be increase by 4 per cent in 2005&#150;06. Detailed allocations will be announced in the autumn.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_15"></a>Schools will be entitled to either a 4 per cent per pupil increase in their school standards grant or their announced SSG band for 2005&#150;06, whichever is higher; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_16"></a>the Learning and Skills Council will increase all its funding rates for school sixth forms by 4 per cent in 2005&#150;06.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40713-51_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>Of course the minimum guarantee must be backed by adequate resources for LEAs. Next year we expect the average increase in the schools formula spending share to be around 7 per cent per pupil, and I intend to set the minimum increase which any authority can receive at 5.5 per cent per pupil. This is a minimum increase&#151;the increase for most authorities will be higher. Setting the minimum increase at this level will again ensure that all authorities have some headroom after implementing the guarantee, to allow the local funding formula to operate or to direct additional resources where they are most needed. The provisional increase for each authority will be announced at the time of the local government settlement in the autumn.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>Authorities where teachers are on the outer London teachers&#039; pay scale face particular pressures in 2005&#150;06 because the value of that scale will increase by a higher amount than the national average increase in teachers&#039; pay as a result of the award for September 2005 following recommendations by the School Teachers&#039; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS57"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column WS57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Review Body. The minimum increase in the schools Formula spending share will therefore be set at 5.8 per cent for these authorities. Again, increases for individual authorities will be announced in the autumn.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>Next year the Government will again expect each authority to passport in full its SFSS increase into a matching increase in its schools budget, unless there are wholly exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>As in 2004&#150;05, we also expect LEA spending on their central education budgets to rise no faster than spending on schools next year. LEAs will again be able to seek an exemption where exceptional local circumstances arise&#151;23 such exemptions were agreed this year. The view of the Schools Forum will again be important when any applications for exemptions are being considered.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>In October the Secretary of State announced a package of transitional support which would be available to authorities to help schools experiencing particular financial difficulties to bring their budgets back into balance. The main element of that package was a targeted grant, totalling &#163;120 million nationally, which went to the 51 authorities which would otherwise have had the lowest increases in revenue support for education between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05. The Secretary of State indicated in his October Statement that around half this amount would be available to the same authorities in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>I can now confirm that the same 51 authorities will be eligible for exactly half of this year&#039;s allocation in 2005&#150;06, subject to broadly the same conditions that applied this year. In particular, eligible authorities will need to update the transitional support plans which were agreed with my department earlier this year, to show how they will use the additional funds to target schools in the greatest difficulty and bring their budgets back into balance. I am placing a list of transitional grant allocations in the Library. No further transitional grant will be available from 2006&#150;07.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS58"></a>

<b>13 Jul 2004 : Column WS58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40713-51_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>This year we also amended the school funding regulations to give all local authorities the flexibility to target their own resources outside their school funding formula to support schools in financial difficulty. A number of authorities have made use of this flexibility in 2004&#150;05 and we propose to continue it in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>Finally, this year my department, working with the National College for School Leadership, KPMG and the head teacher associations, set up a programme of financial management training and support to help head teachers and governors to manage their budgets more effectively. This programme, which has focused in the first year on schools in authorities in receipt of transitional grant, has been very successful and received very positive feedback.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>I am pleased to say that the programme will continue into the coming academic year, and will be expanded to cover schools across the country. Workshops will be available for up to 10,000 schools, and will be based on a menu of options from which LEAs and schools can draw. In particular, workshops will be available to support schools with the financial management aspects of workforce reform, and of falling rolls. Follow-up consultancy will be available for schools that need additional support over and above the workshops, and financial management master classes will be held for LEA staff. The financial management in schools website will also be maintained and enhanced.
</p>

<a name="40713-51_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>The decisions I have outlined today will continue the successful arrangements which have been introduced this year and ensure that the stability and predictability that has been restored to school funding will continue in 2005&#150;06. However, I have always been clear that these arrangements were a short-term measure. The dedicated schools grant that the Government have announced for 2006&#150;07 and beyond, together with guaranteed three-year budgets for schools, will give head teachers and governors unprecedented financial security and confidence, and the ability to plan for the future. The arrangements for 2005&#150;06 that I have announced today will provide an effective bridge to those longer-term arrangements.</p>

The Northern Ireland Court Service holds a central register which records similar information in respect of Northern Ireland applications for judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40713w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>Neither the Administrative Court Office nor the Northern Ireland Court Service record the overall cost of judicial review. This information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Information on which public bodies in England and Wales were subject to judicial review, including who were the complainants, has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Information on which public bodies in Northern Ireland were subject to judicial review, including the number of applications made against each public body, has also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, together with a separate list of the complainants.
</p>

<a name="40713w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The Legal Services Commissions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for the granting and payment of legal aid in relation to judicial reviews issued in their respective jurisdictions.
</p>

<a name="40713w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>The Legal Services Commission for England and Wales is not able to determine, without incurring disproportionate cost, which solicitors received legal aid for judicial review work. However, the total number of judicial review certificates for which a main bill was paid in the calendar year 2003 was 5,740, at a total cost of &#163;20,510,068.
</p>

<a name="40713w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>In Northern Ireland during 2003 a total of &#163;696,000 was paid out of the Legal Aid Fund for judicial review work in respect of 134 cases. A breakdown of the solicitors to whom payments were made cannot be provided for Northern Ireland cases without incurring disproportionate cost.
</p>

<a name="40713w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>It should be noted that not all judicial reviews are funded by legal aid.

To maintain a proper balance in Army manpower numbers it is sometimes necessary to make minor adjustments to inflow and outflow.

<p><a name="wa_st_14"></a>
<a name="40713w02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner:  </b>  Actinic keratosis is a dermatological condition with a small risk of cancer, typically brought on by chronic exposure to sunlight. There are two equally important health issues that need to be addressed: how to treat the condition once it occurs; and how to prevent it in the longer term through effective health education.
</p>

<a name="40713w02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a>Treatment of actinic keratosis is relatively straightforward and involves freezing or cutting away any skin lesions. Guidance published by the Royal College of General Practitioners on the role of general practitioners with a special interest in dermatology will help to improve advice, training and support for general practitioners and other members of the primary health care team in the management of common skin conditions.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a>The General Dental Council&#039;s ethical guidance to registrants states that dentists should practise within the limits of their knowledge, skills and experience.

<p><a name="wa_qn_21"></a>
<a name="40713w03_wqn4"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_29"></a>What claims of damage to health caused by tobacco smoke in the environment have been made by the medical doctors who have recently requested a complete ban on smoking tobacco in indoor public places; what clinical and statistical evidence they provided to support their request; what are the sources of such evidence; and whether they have been tested by any objective expert body.  [HL3689]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_22"></a>
<a name="40713w03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   The Government received 4,500 letters from doctors on the need for smoke-free public places as a result of the initiative of the British Medical Association (BMA).
</p>

<a name="40713w03_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>There is clear evidence of the harm done by secondhand smoke. In 2002, the WHO&#039;s International Agency for Research on Cancer published a summary of its monograph on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, which concluded that &quot;there is sufficient evidence that involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or &#039;environmental&#039; tobacco smoke) causes lung cancer in humans&quot;. The full monograph <i>Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking</i> was published in 2004.
</p>

<a name="40713w03_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>The Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) in 1998 concluded that secondhand smoke is a cause of lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory illness and asthma attacks in children, and is a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.
</p>

<a name="40713w03_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>SCOTH is undertaking a review of studies since 1998 and its report is expected shortly.
</p>

<a name="40713w03_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>The BMA has included its views on smoke-free public places in its response to the <i>Choosing Health?</i> consultation. We are currently considering all the many responses we have received. These will inform the development of a White Paper on improving health that we will publish later in the year.
