<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Baroness Denton of Wakefield) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 10th July be approved.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the draft Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 seeks broadly to harmonise Northern Ireland's road traffic laws with regard to road safety and the regulation of motor vehicles with those in force in Great Britain under the Road Traffic Act 1988.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para1"></a>In brief, this order has four main parts. Part II deals with road safety and introduces a number of new offences which are similar to those introduced in Great Britain by the Road Traffic Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para2"></a>First, the order creates offences involving dangerous driving. These replace the existing bad driving offences, which relate to reckless driving, with dangerous driving offences based more firmly on the offender's actual standard of driving than on his state of mind. The present maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment, where death or grievous bodily injury is involved in such offences, is increased to 10 years.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para3"></a>Secondly, a new offence of causing death or grievous bodily injury by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs is introduced. This will enable courts to respond more effectively to driver behaviour which concurrently involves the three elements of the death or serious injury of another person, driving without due care and attention, and driving when under the influence of drink or drugs. The penalty would also be a maximum 10 years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para4"></a>A further new offence of causing danger to road-users is created. This would involve intentional and unlawful obstruction of a road or interference with vehicles, traffic signs or equipment in such a way as to cause danger of injury to a person or serious damage to property. The gravity of such action is reflected in the penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para5"></a>The opportunity has also been taken to revise the law in relation to cycling, including the introduction of a new dangerous cycling offence. Other new measures include provision concerning the safety of children in motor vehicles in the event of an accident.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para6"></a>Part III of the order deals primarily with the construction and use of vehicles and their equipment and creates new offences, the most important of which concerns the use of vehicles which present a danger of injury to any person.
<P>


<a name="column_1526"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para7"></a>Part IV makes miscellaneous amendments to the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. The most significant of these relates to disqualification and includes a revision of the disqualification provisions for dangerous driving. Offences involving dangerous driving will carry 12 months' minimum disqualification but this increases to two years where they involve death or grievous bodily injury.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para8"></a>Courts are also being given the power when convicting a person of a dangerous driving offence, or of any drink or drugs related offence, to order a shorter period of disqualification or no disqualification where satisfied that special reasons exist. This is in line with Great Britain's corresponding law.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para9"></a>No one can be proud of the casualties from road accidents in Northern Ireland. The order is designed to increase the part which road traffic law can play in seeking to reduce the number of those casualties on Northern Ireland's roads. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para10"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 10th July be approved.&#151;(Baroness Denton of Wakefield.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the order with her usual clarity. The purpose of harmonising legislation in Northern Ireland is, of course, one we support. Perhaps one or two questions may be appropriate. Is there to be the penalty point system in Northern Ireland which most magistrates in this country seem to think works quite well? Why is it necessary to have in Northern Ireland an offence of causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving when none exists in England and Wales? Has not the opportunity been missed to insist on seat belts in minibuses? Finally, I believe that it is a reasonable criticism from our friends and colleagues in Northern Ireland that it has taken so long&#151;four years after its implementation in England and Wales&#151;for the Road Traffic Act to be introduced with modifications in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-01_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, I shall not speak for long but I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without making a few broad observations. Noble Lords have their own individual interests, but road safety is something which affects all of us whether we are pedestrians, cyclists, passengers in motor vehicles or drivers. The subject is diverse and the regulations to be complied with are numerous. Any new measures introduced to reduce so-called accidents must be welcomed. For that reason, I congratulate the Government on introducing the order today. It indicates a commitment to improving road safety and to punishing or removing from the roads those who fall foul of the law.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para11"></a>After saying that, I hope that noble Lords will not think me churlish if I observe that the number of speakers today does not truly represent the importance of the subject before us. Statistics for injury and death due to road traffic accidents in Northern Ireland show that the record is absolutely appalling&#151;even worse than that of the Italians, which is really saying something bad! It can, of course, be partly explained by the policing priority during the disturbances which are now, <P>


<a name="column_1527"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we hope, a thing of the past. However, the matter is being addressed. If the effect of the order is to reduce accidents, I applaud it.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para12"></a>It is now almost 10 years since the system of penalty points was introduced on the mainland for offences relating to accidents, driving, construction and use of vehicles, drink or drugs, traffic direction and signs, theft and other categories. It is surprising that the points system was not introduced into Northern Ireland at the same time and that it still awaits introduction. I understand that the matter is now being addressed and that a draft road traffic offenders order for Northern Ireland should be before Parliament in May next year. I feel that until the points system has been in force for some time, habitual offenders will not be taken off the road and, consequently, the figures for related injury and death will not be dramatically affected for some time.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para13"></a>The official report of the first Standing Committee on the order in another place makes interesting reading, as does the order itself. Some useful contributions and suggestions were made which I hope are being addressed. I do not propose to repeat what was said in that committee.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para14"></a>It appears that a step in the right direction is being taken. More steps are needed, but a good start has been made. I should be delighted if, as a result of this order and the introduction of a penalty points system, road-attributed deaths and injury were reduced considerably. That must be the objective; I hope that it will be achieved.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_time0"></a><H5>11.15 a.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, we broadly welcome the order which should make a contribution to tackling the disgraceful road accident situation in Northern Ireland. If the rate of accidents were reduced to the rate operating in this country, there would be 30 more people alive every year in Northern Ireland. That is quite a large total taken over a period of time in a relatively small population.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para15"></a>The Chief Constable of the RUC has said that in the past he was not able to pay the attention to those matters that he would have wished. We hope that the more peaceful situation will contribute to bringing down the accident figure. We are glad that the draft order was subjected to wide consultation and that it seems to have general support. I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister's answers to the first two questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McConnell: </B>   My Lords, I give a general welcome to the order. There are, however, one or two points I wish to make. Article 79 prohibits the overloading of a lorry or a wrong weight distribution. In the committee in another place, a question was raised about coalmen. Lorries have a load of coal, go round various doors and leave one or two bags at different houses. That alters the weight distribution and can lead to prosecution. The same happens to suppliers of fertiliser to small farms. Drivers leave small loads at different farms and once again the weight distribution is altered and causes liability to prosecution. The process <P>


<a name="column_1528"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1528</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is carried out pretty rigorously. In the one case of which I have knowledge where the weight was found to be wrongly distributed because some bags had been removed, there was an immediate prosecution with no question of advice, a warning or anything else being given. It was slap, bang, prosecute!
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para16"></a>I notice that in Article 57 there is some mitigation: an error of 5 per cent. in the overall weight distribution is permitted. In another place the question was raised regarding coalmen. The Minister promised to send a letter to the Member concerned. I have been unable to obtain a copy. Perhaps the noble Baroness can say what was in it or what should have been in it if no letter was sent.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para17"></a>I support what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Williams. The order was an obvious opportunity to let Northern Ireland for once take the lead and make provisions for seat belts for children where they are carried in minibuses and coaches. When the opportunity presents itself, it seems needless to wait until something is done in other parts of the kingdom.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para18"></a>I am glad to see various measures on road safety. One that must receive attention is the question of speed. There are many speed limits, some of 30 miles an hour in town and in built-up areas, some of 40 miles an hour outside the towns. I frequently watch cars travelling at more than 70 mph in areas with a 40 mph limit. Very seldom does there appear to be any prosecution. I know that for many years the RUC has had many more important matters to attend to. Perhaps now, when there is more opportunity, it might pay a little more attention to the question of excessive speed. It contributes substantially to death and injury on the roads.
<P>

<a name="51103-01_para19"></a>With those few remarks, I welcome the introduction of this draft order.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo951103/text/51103-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend give me just a little guidance? In relation to Article 22 on page 22, can she confirm a point regarding what I believe are classified as authorised motoring events? Am I right in thinking that these are two events involving motor cars, the Ulster Rally and the Circuit of Ireland; and that there used to be 10 other events, presumably authorised motoring events, in relation to which the roads were closed, namely, motor cycle races? If there have been any major alterations, perhaps my noble friend will let me know. If it is too complicated a matter for her to respond today, I should be delighted to receive a written communication.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para0"></a>I am also curious in relation to Articles 39 to 41, on page 36, dealing with horses. I seem to remember that in County Fermanagh, and above all in the Impartial Reporter that seems to come out each week from Enniskillen, there was always a great deal of mention, not necessarily of equestrianism, but of the quite frequent use of horses in that part of Northern Ireland. Am I right in thinking that there is no similar legislation this side of the water? Certainly it would appear to be very relevant in certain parts of Northern Ireland. Perhaps my noble friend can confirm that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I should like to raise two points. I gave notice to the noble Baroness, Lady Denton, <P>


<a name="column_1529"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the more important of the two. First, on the less important one, turning to page 10 of the order, about two-thirds of the way down, "motor cycle" is defined as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a mechanically propelled vehicle, not being an invalid carriage, with less than 4 wheels and the weight of which...does not exceed 410 kilograms". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para1"></a>Leaving aside the curious grammar, that is odd in itself. Most of us think of a three-wheeled car as a car. Such vehicles normally have 90 per cent. of the attributes of a car and only 10 per cent. of the attributes of a motor cycle. But so be it.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para2"></a>I shall revert to the grammar. The noble Baroness may remember that irate customers of Marks & Spencer forced that company to alter the signs above its express check-out tills from "Less than five items" to "Fewer than five items". As a would-be guardian of the English language I should like Her Majesty's Government to set a good example. It is obviously too late to do so on this occasion, but perhaps it might be borne in mind for the future. People say "less than 5 per cent." or "less than 4 per cent.", as indeed one must, or "less than four pence an ounce". But one should not say "less than four wheels".
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para3"></a>I turn to the more important of the two matters. In Article 94 on page 84 and in Schedule 2 on page 104, dealing respectively with the minimum disqualification period and the maximum prison sentence that can be imposed for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving or death by careless driving under the influence of drink and drugs, one notices that these rightly severe penalties apply not only to instances where death is caused, as in England, Scotland and Wales, but also when the bad driving causes "grievous bodily injury" not physically resulting in death. This may or may not be a good thing, but it is undeniably different from the law in England, Scotland and Wales. Can the noble Baroness say whether this measure was only recently introduced into Northern Ireland law or whether it has been the case for some time; and whether there is a particular reason why the law in Northern Ireland should differ from the law on the mainland in this respect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I also thank the Minister for the clarity with which she explained the order. I wonder whether she can explain what action is being taken to prevent the horrendous toll of accidents and injury in Northern Ireland as opposed to punishing those who effectively commit the offences.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para4"></a> I refer to two particular elements which will probably be very useful. One is a public information and education campaign about road safety, not only in schools but for the general public. In addition, there are measures to prevent speeding on suburban roads. I refer to what are generally termed "traffic calming measures"; for example, chicanes and humps, or "sleeping policemen", being built into suburban roads. There are other mechanisms that can be used to exert a calming influence on traffic.
<P>


<a name="column_1530"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1530</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para5"></a>My reason for asking this question is that such modifications of the roads require capital expenditure. Is any money being made available to the authorities in Northern Ireland to enable them to implement such traffic calming measures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, first it is a delight to see so many people here this morning who are interested in Northern Ireland business. In particular, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will share my delight in taking this order at this time of day and not in the afternoon.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para6"></a>There is common agreement that this matter is important. We have to take steps to remedy figures that are clearly not very good news. I was interested to hear the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, compare drivers in Northern Ireland to those in Italy. It seems that a love of motor cars is co-related to a love of speed. That is a message that we must get through. The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, also raised the point. The main influence on speed is the driver's decision. Therefore, an education job, as well as a policing job, is necessary. The figures show that very little difference is made to arrival times by an excess of speed. I hope that that point will come through.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para7"></a>Noble Lords asked many interesting questions. I hope that I can answer most of them. The effect of the police being visible and involved in maintaining road traffic law is important. There are many changes in Northern Ireland now. If fighting terrorism comes off the top of the agenda, one can concentrate on many other areas. I understand that simply the sight of police cars on certain roads, where in the past it would not have been safe for police cars to park, has made a difference to road traffic.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para8"></a>I share with the House one story that came out of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin. Apparently, fairly early on in the life of that forum, Sinn Fein members stood up and complained about being harassed about their road tax licence discs&#151;at which point, other people were able to say, "Welcome to the real world". So we are making progress.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para9"></a>This order came forward rather later than the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would have liked. In looking at the 1991 GB Act, it was decided that we should go for a full-scale movement in the legal system rather than seek to amend the law again. Today's order is the first of a series of orders which will rewrite the law in this area in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para10"></a>Coming forward is the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order, which will include penalty point provisions as noble Lords have indicated that they are an important deterrent. When introducing a system of penalty points, there is a need to set up an administrative system and there is a cost involved. I am delighted to say that that is now in order and the measure will be brought forward very shortly. I hope that everything will be in place by mid-1997. Noble Lords will probably wish that it were earlier; but we have to make sure that there is consultation, that we have the money to do it and that the system will operate correctly. I am often criticised from the Benches opposite about bringing forward legislation too fast and <P>


<a name="column_1531"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>without due care and consideration (I believe that that is the appropriate phrase today). We are taking that very seriously.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para11"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Williams, raised the question of causing grievous bodily injury. That is an existing and long-standing offence under Northern Ireland road traffic legislation. The background to the offence is that when a person who has been grievously injured in a road accident dies some days later, in some cases it can be difficult to prove in court that death arose from the accident. The offence also takes account of the victim who is severely disabled as the consequence of another person's dangerous driving. We therefore consider it important to retain the alternative of bringing charges on the grounds of causing grievous bodily injury.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, referred to the problem of someone going about his job of delivering coal or fertiliser, for example, and he asked why people were being prosecuted so quickly. The evidence that I have been given shows that, particularly in coal delivery type work, often small vehicles are used and overloads on such vehicles are usually dealt with by the DoE transport enforcement officers by way of advice rather than prosecution. There is an attempt to be constructive. With larger vehicles, the load distribution problem could be overcome by the fitment of a support board placed longitudinally or across the vehicle, thus allowing selective removal of the load and enabling the vehicle to keep within the legal requirements.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para13"></a>The question was asked why we could not use this legislation to lead on the issue of seat belts in coaches and minibuses used to transport children. We are very conscious of this issue. I can assure noble Lords that the intention is to maintain parity with GB on this matter.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, referred to the fact that the figures were horrendous. It was interesting that yesterday I stood up in the House and celebrated the fact that deaths from terrorism had been reduced. But the figures for road deaths in Northern Ireland this year show that 115 people died through road accidents. This is a very serious matter. I am delighted to say that, compared with the same period for the previous two years, there is movement in the right direction. However, it is not enough. That is why we plan to continue to bring forward a full legislative programme that will help in this area. There is a target of one third reduction of road deaths and serious injuries in Northern Ireland by the year 2000. We hope that we can achieve that. The 1994 figure represented a 24 per cent. reduction compared with the base period of 1981-85. So we are moving in the right direction.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Lyell showed his love both of fast motor cars and of Fermanagh. Let me reassure him on both counts that the Road Races (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 continues to make provision relating to road races, and under that order certain road traffic enactments are suspended in so far as they would otherwise apply to those engaged in motor racing on the roads. It will not surprise your Lordships to know that I share my noble friend's love in that area. Both motor <P>


<a name="column_1532"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>vehicle and motor cycle racing are big contributors to the tourism figures in Northern Ireland, which offers a great attraction in that respect. They are loved by the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para16"></a>I can reassure my noble friend that the Fermanagh scene with regard to horse traffic as opposed to the scene in Great Britain continues to be different. We do not feel it appropriate to withdraw the legislation affecting horse led or horse driven vehicles. I hope that it will not be needed but it still stays in place. My noble friend is right to recognise that the situation there is still different from the norm.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para17"></a>I hope to reassure your Lordships when I say that there is research coming forward from the Transport Research Laboratory with an analysis of why the figures of Northern Ireland are so different from the figures here. That will allow us to go forward.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, very rightly said that prevention is infinitely better than enforcement subsequent to an accident or death. We published our first road safety plan in July 1995. It sets out how everybody involved in this area will work together to achieve that one third reduction. There is a heavy publicity campaign, and money is being spent not only on safety education in schools, which is important, but also on the education of those people involved in accidents. The funding allocated for the current year 1995-96 for road safety education and publicity is &#163;1.5 million; and for engineering accident remedial and safety schemes it is &#163;1.5 million, too. The calming measures in the past have been security measures to slow down the traffic. It is nice to feel that we can now do that for a more peaceful purpose.
<P>

<a name="51103-02_para19"></a>I shall take away this morning the requirement of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that officials should look at their respect for the English language, which I must confess is usually rather better than mine. I take the message, too. I hope that I have covered most of the points raised. I shall read Hansard carefully, and if I have missed any points, I shall reply in writing. I commend the order to the House.

<P>

<a name="51103-03_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of the draft Police (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) order 1995 is to make changes to police powers, police discipline and police complaints procedure.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para1"></a>The changes to police powers and discipline procedure are similar to those made in England and Wales by provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 respectively. I should like to comment briefly on the main parts of the order.
<P>


<a name="column_1533"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para2"></a>Part II of the order makes changes to police powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. The principal amendments are: the application of the order to persons in custodial establishments who are brought to police stations for interview; powers of arrest without warrant for persons unlawfully at large or who fail to answer to police bail; the extension of sampling powers to recordable offences and the ability to make speculative searches of fingerprints and samples held by or on behalf of police; and the removal of mouth searches from the interpretation of an "intimate search".
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para3"></a>Part III of the order makes changes to disciplinary procedures which will have the effect of raising standards still further. The main changes are a wider power for the Secretary of State to make regulations for dealing with poor performance as well as simplified procedures for dealing with misconduct, and the removal of the so called "double jeopardy" rule whereby disciplinary proceedings can be brought against an officer who has been convicted or acquitted of a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para4"></a>Turning to the police complaints procedures in Part IV of the draft order, the majority of the changes give effect to certain recommendations made by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints which have been accepted by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para5"></a>There was wide consultation on all aspects of the draft order&#151;policing matters are always of great concern in Northern Ireland&#151;and one amendment was made as a result. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints will be included at Article 29 as a body which the Secretary of State must consult about regulations made under Part V of the order.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para6"></a>In summary, the provisions of the order will ensure that, in several important areas of policing policy, changes which the Government have implemented in England and Wales will also be given effect in Northern Ireland. The reforms represent a balanced package of measures which will allow the Royal Ulster Constabulary to take full advantage of developments in the investigation and detection of crime while enhancing police accountability through the modernisation of complaints and discipline procedures. I beg to move.

<A NAME="51103-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the Minister indicated that it was intended to set up a scheme in Northern Ireland similar&#151;I use her word&#151;to the scheme provided by the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act in this country. That is incorrect. The scrutiny and severe criticism which your Lordships applied to that Bill in this House led to its amendment in significant respects. In particular, the measure provided that there should be full representation on a police authority of those who are not the nominees or place people of the Home Secretary. Why is the police authority in Northern Ireland to continue to be staffed by such persons&#151;in other words, nominees of the Secretary of State? If that is necessary for the time being, can the Minister indicate <P>


<a name="column_1534"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Government hope to ameliorate the situation reasonably soon? That is a question of fundamental principle.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para8"></a>I have one question only on detail. In Article 14, on page 15 of the draft order, one sees that appeal tribunals are available for officers who are dismissed, required to resign or reduced in rank. Is there to be no appeal for an officer who is disciplined and penalised by loss of earnings? I shall be grateful for that question to be addressed because it causes a great deal of anxiety to serving officers in Northern Ireland.

<A NAME="51103-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness said that there was widespread consultation on the order, and I welcome that. That being so, it has been possible to reach a substantial measure of agreement. As the Minister said, some provisions give additional powers to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, particularly in relation to body samples taken in connection with serious criminal offences. That has proved of considerable value to police forces in England and Wales and it is highly desirable that it should apply also in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para9"></a>I wish to refer to the question of police conduct and discipline dealt with in Part III of the order. First, I repeat the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. Why has it been decided not to allow access to an appeal tribunal in a case where an officer has been fined? The implications of a heavy fine are considerable; in some circumstances there are implications in relation to pension rights. I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain that. Also, what assumption of public expenditure is the noble Baroness making in relation to the tribunals and what additional costs would arise if fines were included in the provision?
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para10"></a>I want to touch on the Independent Commission for Police Complaints. There is to be a review. That is sensible, especially in the light of the new situation in Northern Ireland. When will it begin and who will conduct it? I am sure that the Government have made provisional decisions already; it would be helpful if we could be told what the timescale is to be.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para11"></a>I welcome the robust attitude of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland towards some of the most foolish recommendations of the committee of Sir Patrick Sheehy. One of the great accomplishments of Sir Patrick Mayhew is that he saw off Sir Patrick Sheehy. Unhappily, the Home Secretary did not, and a whole series of ill-judged provisions were included in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill, some of which were removed in this House, but others were not. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland simply declined to accept some recommendations. To give one illustration, the rank of deputy chief constable was removed from the ranking structure of police forces in England and Wales, but it continues in Northern Ireland. I welcome that and pay tribute to Sir Patrick Sheehy&#151;not Sir Patrick Sheehy; the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&#151;for not adopting many of the <P>


<a name="column_1535"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recommendations of Sir Patrick Sheehy which have done considerable damage to the police services in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I have but one question for the noble Baroness. In England and Wales&#151;I am not sure of the position in Scotland&#151;an intimate sample can only be taken from somebody who is in police detention on suspicion of a serious offence. Looking at Article 10 on page 9, it would appear that under the terms of the order an intimate sample may be taken from a person who is not in police detention, under certain restrictive circumstances. Can the noble Baroness say whether or not I am correct in my assumption that the proposed law differs in Northern Ireland from that in England and Wales, and if so, why?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their interest and comments. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, in relation to the appointment of members of police authorities by the Secretary of State, conditions are still different in Northern Ireland. We must proceed slowly with change. The review in the White Paper will consider the reform of policing structures and that will come forward. I can say to him that we must be unique in our characters as Ministers in that, if we are successful, we are working ourselves out of a job in the long term, but that is our intention.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para12"></a>I sympathise with the confusion of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, in relation to the two Sir Patricks. We, in Northern Ireland, have the same problem occasionally in relation to the burial places of Saint Patrick, which also seem to be numerous and extensive. But in relation to why appeal to the tribunal is restricted to punishments of dismissal and so forth and not to lesser crimes, police officers other than senior officers will have the right of appeal against all punishments&#151;in the first instance to the chief constable&#151;but lesser punishments are considered essentially a matter for internal police management. It would be inappropriate for an officer to appeal the punishment of a fine all the way up to a tribunal. We hope that the review will start in November and we expect to announce the name of the reviewer very shortly. Progress is being made on that. I am afraid that, despite the courtesy of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, I shall have to write to him on that issue, but I shall do so as quickly as possible. I commend the order to the House.

<P>

<a name="51103-03_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is the latest in a series of such orders which are required every two to three years. The main purpose of the orders is to <P>


<a name="column_1536"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adjust certain statutory limits and to deal with other routine financial matters. I shall describe the main provisions.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para15"></a>Article 3 provides that the Department of Finance and Personnel may amend the requirement routinely to seek its consent or approval. That will help to ensure more efficient administrative arrangements.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para16"></a>Articles 4 to 6 are of a technical nature. They amend the Financial Provisions (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 in relation to the reserves, public dividend capital and borrowing limits of trading funds. That will bring Northern Ireland into line with the position in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para17"></a>Article 4 permits the net assets in a trading fund's opening balance sheet to be financed by accounting reserves, as well as by deemed debt and public dividend capital. When the 1993 legislation was enacted, all trading funds were using cash accounts and traded as a new business in accounting terms. However, future trading funds are likely to have accruals-based accounts and it is sensible to treat them as a continuing business.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para18"></a>Article 5 extends the powers to issue public dividend capital so that it can be used to finance any expenditure undertaken by a trading fund&#151;not just opening capital. That will provide additional flexibility where, for example, a trading fund needs to finance a large capital expenditure programme.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para19"></a>Article 6 makes changes to trading funds' borrowing limits. It brings public dividend capital within the maximum borrowing limit which applies to an individual fund and the maximum amount of borrowing which may be undertaken by all trading funds.
<P>

<a name="51103-03_para20"></a>Article 7 extends the time limits for the presentation and audit of certain accounts. Article 8 removes the current requirement that a loan made to Enterprise Ulster must be repaid within the same financial year. That should help Enterprise Ulster plan its financial arrangements more efficiently. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="51103-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I entirely accept that this is largely a technical and enabling order and therefore I have only one question to ask. Years pass, the Minister introduces similar orders and I always ask the same question. I omitted to give her the appropriate notice of it and so if she wishes to write to me I shall be quite happy with that. Have the Government come to any conclusion about what is to happen with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in so far as it applies to Northern Ireland? The Minister has heard that question so often that I am tempted to have an anniversary dinner for the two of us because I never have a conclusive reply.

<A NAME="51103-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 16th October be approved [29th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of this draft order is to give effect, without modification, to the recommendations made by the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland in its fourth periodical report on parliamentary constituencies, submitted to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 21st June of this year. In accordance with Section 28(2) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 the commission also submitted to my right honourable friend on the same day its second supplementary report. Today's draft order also gives effect, without modification, to the supplementary report.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para2"></a>The Northern Ireland Boundary Commission published its provisional recommendations in January last year. In accordance with Section 6(2) of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 the representations received on the recommendations caused the commission to hold five public local inquiries between May and June last year. Following on from the inquiries, the commission published its revised recommendations in January this year.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para3"></a>Under the provisions in Schedule 2, paragraph 1(4) of the 1986 Act, the commission has now recommended that Northern Ireland should be divided into 18 constituencies for parliamentary elections and that five members should be returned to a Northern Ireland Assembly from each of the 18 constituencies. This increases the total membership of a Northern Ireland Assembly from 85 to 90. These revised recommendations are the commission's final recommendations and form the draft Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order before us.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para4"></a>The Government are confident that in arriving at the recommendations incorporated in the draft order the Northern Ireland Boundary Commission has complied fully with the relevant requirements of Schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is satisfied that sufficient opportunity was given for representations to the commission. On that basis, I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="51103-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, we are most grateful for the care with which the commission conducted its work. I have only a single question to ask. <P>


<a name="column_1538"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The commission suggested that there might be benefits in altering its procedure for the future. Those suggested modifications are in pages 31 to 34 of the report. Have the Government come to a view about acting on those suggestions, or is it perhaps too early? If it is too early, perhaps I may expect a letter in the post.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness had an opportunity to read the Hansard report of the debate which took place when a reallocation of the seats and the setting of the boundaries in Northern Ireland last took place in 1978? At that time there was great controversy. There was a Speaker's Conference, of which I was a member, which sat on 12 occasions. There was great opposition both in the Speaker's Conference and in the Commons itself. It arose particularly because the then major opposition party in Northern Ireland, the SDLP, of which I was the leader, took the view that to increase the number of seats in Northern Ireland would lead to integration. The argument for integration was led by the then MP for South Down, Enoch Powell, and the Unionist Party.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para6"></a>One could stand here today and speak for hours about the history of these matters. There are legitimate questions to be asked. When the Northern Ireland state came into being, a parliament was created which had 52 parliamentary seats representing seats returning members to Stormont. They were given quite a number of powers&#151;in fact, all the major powers&#151;about unemployment, health and social services. The only matters that were kept from them were the powers to collect tax and to manage defence.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para7"></a>Under those circumstances it was decided that they would be given 12 seats at Westminster because the parliament of Northern Ireland retained so many powers. After the demise of the Northern Ireland parliament in 1972, an assembly was set up which did not last for very long. At that time the Labour Government&#151;my noble friend was then Home Secretary&#151;were in the grip of the Unionist members; that is something like what is happening today with a different Government.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para8"></a>The Unionist members were able to push, blackmail and dragoon the Labour Government into setting up the Speaker's Conference, which ultimately led to an increase in the number of seats because they believed in integration. I led the Opposition party at that time and it was totally opposed to any increase in the number of seats representing Northern Ireland constituencies. I fought tenaciously along those lines in the other place, but eventually the measure was carried and the number of seats was increased from 12 to 17. It is rather remarkable that when the seats were fought at the succeeding election in 1983, of the five seats which had been created, four were won by the Opposition; namely, the party that had campaigned against any increase in the number of seats. Therefore, it is quite obvious that that party is no longer so opposed to the increase in the number of seats.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para9"></a>In these recommendations an extra seat is created. That extra seat was created amidst considerable controversy. It was perhaps not made public, but the controversy was considerable. The original report, referred to by the noble Baroness, recommended a <P>


<a name="column_1539"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reduction of one in the number of constituencies, the seat in question being held by a member of the SDLP. If that recommendation had been carried out there would not have been the peace process because the SDLP would have refused to become involved in the process if it had been going to lose one of its seats.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para10"></a>Pressure was applied from many sources both within and outside Ireland. To make certain that that seat continued in being, the boundaries had to be rejigged and another seat created&#151;West Tyrone. That will probably be a nationalist seat held either by Sinn Fein or the SDLP. Therefore, one can see that it is not a straightforward recommendation. There were very highly political motives behind the recommendations of the Boundary Commission.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para11"></a>Allied to that, there is the recommendation that an assembly be set up in Northern Ireland. One does not need to go into the Government's change of attitude in relation to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Government refuse adamantly to countenance any suggestion that an assembly is set up in Scotland whereas in Northern Ireland they are making arrangements for an assembly to be set up with an increase in the number of seats.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para12"></a>The Government have said that, if there is to be an assembly in Scotland, there will be a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs who take their seats at Westminster. As regards Northern Ireland, the Government take a contrary view. They say that there will be an assembly of 90 members and an extra seat will be given in the process. That seems to be a totally different and, as regards the Government's proposals for Scotland, untenable argument.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para13"></a>There are to be 90 members of the Northern Ireland assembly. In fact, it will be the most over-governed place in the United Kingdom. Every Westminster constituency will have five assemblymen. I have had some experience of that. Those five assemblymen will all be competing to see who can be successful in taking the Westminster seat from its present holder. Therefore, the scene has been set for all sorts of in-fighting and dog-fighting between the assembly men to take over the Westminster seat.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para14"></a>Under the present proposals, the framework document and so forth, the assembly is to be given very large powers, if agreement can be found, within the assembly and by the members elected thereto. I have serious reservations about whether or not the assembly will ever come into being, or if it does, whether agreement will be found.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para15"></a>If the assembly is founded and is successful, what powers will it be given? Will it be given all the powers that were formerly held by the Stormont Parliament, which had only 52 seats, or the previous assembly, which did not last very long? Will all the powers as regards Northern Ireland affairs be given to that assembly? Will there be any suggestion of a reduction in the number of Northern Ireland MPs taking their seats here? That seems to be the argument as it is applied to Scotland. I can foresee some very great problems arising within that assembly of 90 members. I can quite <P>


<a name="column_1540"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understand that. They will want to take decisions in relation to the constituents whom they represent and with whom they are living in the same country.
<P>

<a name="51103-04_para16"></a>This increase in the boundaries is not a straightforward question. The extra seat was given because of outside intervention. The most important question is this: if and when the assembly comes into operation, what powers will be given to it? If quite a number of powers are transferred to the assembly, will that affect the number of MPs from Northern Ireland who take their seats in this House?

<A NAME="51103-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, arising out of that very interesting speech, perhaps my noble friend the Minister will tell us the average number of the electorate in a Northern Ireland Westminster seat and how that compares with the average size of an electorate in England and Wales?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their contributions on this order before the House. I begin by agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that it is unusual for any matter to be raised in Northern Ireland without controversy. As regards the order before the House, I cannot add anything or go beyond the reasoning given in the commission's report. It is an independent body and I have no information available to me beyond that contained in the commission's report and its other published papers. The Government are satisfied that the commission has carried out its review conscientiously and within the guidelines laid down by the rules.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para0"></a>The revised recommendations propose that there should be 18 constituencies. The commission endeavoured to draw up proposals for 17 constituencies which would give effect to the recommendations of the five assistant commissioners who conducted the local inquiries. However, that proved to be an impossible task without causing excessive disparity between the proposed electorate and the electoral quotas.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para1"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, the review which has been announced by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will take into account the other matters raised by the commission. It is important that that is so. They will be considered along with our own considerations of their importance. The form and composition of the review has yet to be decided, but all the matters recommended by the Northern Ireland Boundary Commission will be considered in the review.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked me to look at the electoral average. I can advise him that, with the recommended number of 18 seats, the electoral average for Northern Ireland would be 64,082 constituents; in England the figure is 68,626; and in Scotland it is 54,569; so there is, I hope, some level of common ground as a result of the effective and fair work of the Boundary Commission. I commend the Motion to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="51103-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, as no amendments have been tabled on Third Reading, I wonder whether it is appropriate for me to comment on the Bill at this point. However, if I may do so, as the noble Baroness and your Lordships will be aware, on Second Reading I said that we had no particular difficulty with Clauses 1 and 3, but that we had some difficulty with Clauses 2 and 4 which contained retrospective legislation. Since that time the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee has reported on the Bill and made certain suggestions about some of the provisions of Clause 1. We are satisfied with the assurances that Ministers have given in response to the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee and have no particular complaints about them, provided they are met. The regulations are already out to consultation and we were told quite firmly by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, that they will be produced in January next year. I very much hope that the Government will adhere to that timetable.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para6"></a>However, Clause 2 still gives us problems. It will come as no surprise to the noble Baroness that we believe that the Government have not really perceived the problems raised by Clause 2, not least that set out in Committee by my noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn. We do not think that the Government understood what my noble friend was saying. We do not think that they took the point. However, there has been correspondence since then and we have to leave it at that.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para7"></a>Clause 4 in our view, and in the view of my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford in Committee, is quite unnecessary in Scotland. There have been no cases requiring retrospective legislation of this nature in Scotland; and, as the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, pointed out then, the clause was intended simply as a safety-first procedure lest anything untoward should happen. That seems a slightly undesirable way of making legislation. We should not introduce retrospective provisions where there is no necessity for them.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para8"></a>Having said all that, my thanks are due first to the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, who introduced the Bill on Second Reading; secondly, to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who took the Bill through Committee; and, thirdly, to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, who is now taking the Bill through its Third Reading&#151;a fine array of ministerial talent, if I may say so, on a fairly technical Bill. My thanks are also due to my noble friends Lord Williams of Mostyn and Lord Ewing of Kirkford who helped in Committee.

I shall not rehearse the arguments in favour of retrospective validation again today. Our view, which a good many planning authorities appear to share (because they have not sought refunds of the charges they have paid), is that these provisions simply restore the situation to what authorities and government departments thought it was since the late 1970s.

<a name="51103-05_para12"></a>I had intended to send the Bill on its way with a formal thank-you to all those noble Lords who have co-operated in the proceedings so far, but in view of the fact that there is a very prominent article in today's Daily Telegraph which blames your Lordships for trying to kill the Bill, perhaps I may put one or two comments on the record.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para13"></a>The Bill arrived in your Lordships' House just before the Summer Recess, and we gave it its Second Reading within four days of resuming. The Committee stage followed on 31st October&#151;this week. If your Lordships agree to its Third Reading, we shall have completed the remaining stages of the Bill this week. Therefore, we cannot be accused of delaying the Bill. When the Bill arrived here, it contained a number of ambiguities in its wording which worried a good many noble Lords. It was clear that some amendments would have to be made. We had meetings with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports, and the British Field Sports Society. After long discussions, all the amendments that were put to the House on Tuesday were agreed, with in some cases the complete understanding of the RSPCA that those amendments were necessary.

<P>

<a name="51103-05_para14"></a>I believe that even at this late stage if the Bill goes back to the Commons there are devices which can be used to get it onto the statute book before the Session ends, but that is not a matter for us. It is not the business of this House to rubberstamp anything that comes from the other place. We have a duty to look at the wording of every Bill that we pass to see that we are not creating a playground for lawyers. In this case, I think that that is what we have done. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I wish to support the very wise words of the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol. When it came to us, this Bill was defective. Clause 1 would have caused so much trouble. It was unworkable. It would have been unfair to lorry drivers, for example. If by chance a lorry ran over a hedgehog in the road, the driver would have been guilty of an offence whether or not he had intended to do anything to the hedgehog. He may not even have seen it. I give that as just one example of the many that were mentioned during our earlier proceedings.
<P>

<a name="51103-05_para16"></a>That would have been a ridiculous way for us to have legislated. I wish that the Bill could get on to the statute book in this Session. If there were the slightest chance of it doing so, that would be splendid. But even if it cannot, we have the satisfaction of knowing that instead of enacting a defective measure in this Session, which we would have done had we not considered it carefully, we can now have a legally effective and enforceable Bill passed into law, perhaps early in the next Session, without much discussion. That is a more sensible way for us to legislate. We should all be grateful to the noble Baroness for what she has done.

<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has just said. It is not for this House to pass defective legislation, however well intentioned it may be. The noble Baroness has put the record straight, and it is right that she should have done so. There have been other similar episodes. I remember, as no doubt the noble Lord, Lord Renton, does, the misfortunes which attended the Bail (Amendment) Bill where the argument was that if we agreed to any amendment the Bill would be killed. As a result of that, the Procedure Committee laid it down that it is unacceptable to use that argument, as it clearly is, because if we got into that way of approach with Private Members' Bills from the other place we would in reality have a unicameral legislature which applied only to Private Members' Bills from the other place, which would be manifestly absurd.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para0"></a>This House has discharged its constitutional responsibilities very well. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, was right, if I may say so, with the amendment that he introduced. The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, has handled the Bill with considerable skill, and we are all in her debt and that of those associated with her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, from the Front Bench I wish to say how grateful we must all be to my noble friend for her persistence in providing this <P>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House with every opportunity to do a job which should have been done in the other place before we received the Bill. The sad fact is that until late in the day we had assumed&#151;we now know wrongly&#151;that as a result of all the work done in the other place in haste (it only left the other place in the third week of July) the interests affected by the Bill had ensured that they had produced a satisfactory piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para1"></a>The irony is that some people down the other end were talking about the passage of the Bill. Well, it only passed from one House to the other. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, was right when he said that we should all recognise that this is a revising Chamber, and that if there is a revising job to do, we have to do it. Sadly, there are casualties when this House is determined to do its job. I echo what my noble friend said. Our job was to do our level best to improve the Bill and get it out of this place, with the faint hope&#151;there is a hope&#151;that there is a device, as my noble friend said&#151;I prefer to use the term "procedures"&#151;or procedures which can still be used, given good will. As I understand it, the Bill, as it stands, has no opponents.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para2"></a>The Bill has been improved. We know that the outside bodies which worked to assist parliamentarians here are the same as those which worked to assist parliamentarians down the Corridor. Given the maximum of good will and no opposition, I still believe that the Leader of the House and Mr. John McFall, the Bill's promoter, could find common ground. There would be no casualties if the Bill was passed, but there may be casualties if the Bill is held up.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para3"></a>The House expresses its warm appreciation to my noble friend and to those who insisted, courteously, upon their right to improve the Bill. When he replies the Minister should be aware that he would be doing the House a great service if he were to recognise the spirit in which these exchanges have taken place and, in whatever way he can and in whatever way his officials can, convey to the other place the fact that we would be delighted if, even at this late stage, an opportunity were found to pass the Bill into law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I too may congratulate the noble Baroness on her skill in piloting the Bill through the House, and thank her for her great courtesy, sensitivity and willingness to listen. The aims of the Bill in its present revised form are admirable. I hope and trust that it will reach the statute book before long, whether it be this Session or the next.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para4"></a>Striking a rather different note, I am afraid, I had not intended to let this occasion pass without expressing my dismay at remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, on Second Reading (Hansard, col. 882) when I was not present, when she appeared to imply that the Government were neutral on the issue not just on the merits of field sports, which is a reasonable enough position to take, but on the continuation of the traditional right of country people to pursue their traditional sports, which is a very different matter.

<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Tope </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to increase resources to enable primary schools to improve the quality of education.
<P>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I wish to start by thanking all noble Lords who have indicated a wish to speak in this brief debate. Friday is a difficult day for many, and the fact that we have so many distinguished speakers is an indication of the importance of the subject to your Lordships' House. In view of other current news this week, I should start by declaring my own interests. For the past nine-and-a-half years I have been leader of a local education authority. Perhaps more important in the context of this debate, I am a governor of a junior school in the ward that I represent on that LEA. Perhaps most important of all, I am married to a primary school teacher, although I hasten to add that she will disclaim all responsibility for anything I say this morning.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para8"></a>I need not spend valuable time speaking of the importance of good primary education. It is the time in school life when children often have their closest relationship with their teachers, and when teachers can, perhaps, have their greatest formative influence. It is also the time when most parents probably have their closest relationship with a local school and with their children's teacher. We all recognise the importance of a good start. That is why we are here this morning.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para9"></a>My Question refers deliberately to the quality of education. It is quality which is of most concern to everyone. I do not believe that quality can be improved merely by increasing resources. Throwing money at a problem seldom resolves it. More money alone does not turn a bad teacher into a good one. Scarce resources need to be targeted and monitored properly to achieve the greatest effect.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para10"></a>However, I do not believe that we can improve or even maintain the quality of education without more resources. The Government will say that they have been <P>


<a name="column_1546"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>putting more resources into education and particularly into primary education. But I wish to look at the facts. The figures recently obtained from the Department for Education and Employment by the honourable Member for Bath show that in one year alone, between January 1994 and January 1995, the number of primary schoolchildren in classes of over 40 increased by 30 per cent. to over 18,000. The number in classes of over 35 increased by 11,000 to over 100,000 in just one year. Last January there were a staggering 1.15 million primary schoolchildren in classes of over 30.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para11"></a>But those shameful figures are out of date; they relate to last January. Since then we have the education spending cuts of this year: an average cut of &#163;50 for each and every primary school pupil in the country. We have had the Government's refusal to fund the teachers' pay award, which this year many schools have had to fund themselves. The figures for class sizes which are to be published next January will show an even more disgraceful picture.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para12"></a>The Government say that class sizes make no difference. Parents do not believe that, teachers do not believe that, and school governors do not believe it. Indeed, anyone who knows anything about primary school teaching knows that that cannot be true. It is self-evident that the more children there are in a class the less individual time and attention a teacher can give them. Indeed, primary school teachers have told me that one additional child over about 25 in the class seems equivalent to two or three more simply in terms of classroom noise levels.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para13"></a>But we do not have to take the subjective view of teachers, governors and parents. Mr. Duncan Graham, the former chairman and chief executive of the National Curriculum Council, said only last month that the national curriculum in primary schools was designed for classes of 25. He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The further you go beyond 30 the greater the difficulties become. Beyond 35 I would question whether you really are getting any kind of value for money". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para14"></a>Well over 1 million primary school children are now taught in classes of over 30. Do the Government really believe that that is any kind of value for money?
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para15"></a>The Government are always keen to blame someone else, never to accept the responsibility themselves. They claim that LEAs are keeping too much in the centre which should be devolved to schools. Where is the evidence for this? The opposite is true now. In recent years most LEAs, my own included, have done everything possible to protect schools' budgets. The cuts in the education budget have fallen primarily on central education departments rather than on schools. As a result, the staff lost are the inspectors, the advisory teachers and the education welfare officers&#151;the much needed school support staff. All those people were dismissed by the Prime Minister as being wasteful administrators.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para16"></a>Yet those people are missed most by primary schools. Generally, primary schools are small, with few staff, and are usually too small to have their own infrastructure and support services. Their governors need such support from the LEA if they are to be able to cope with all the <P>


<a name="column_1547"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1547</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibilities now placed upon them. The teachers need that support to give them the time to do the job for which they have been trained, which is teaching. We should be increasing those resources so that teachers do not lose vital contact time with pupils because they have to respond to government bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para17"></a>The other ploy used by the Government is to claim that LEAs and schools are sitting on large reserves which they refuse to use. Reserves can be used only once. They postpone the problem; they do not solve it. The House of Commons Select Committee on Education recognised that in its fifth report, published last week, when it reported that last year local government reserves fell by over &#163;850 million, with a larger fall expected this year, and that school reserves fell by &#163;100 million in that year. At paragraph 19, the Select Committee concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe it would not be possible for all local authorities and schools to draw upon reserves in future years in the way that a number of authorities managed in 1995-96". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para18"></a>I hope that today the Minister will assure us that the Government now recognise and share that view.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para19"></a>So much more needs to be said about primary education and the resources that are needed, not least those needed for special needs, which is extremely important. Resources are also needed for more and better teacher training and for the repair and maintenance of buildings and equipment. But time is against me and I hope that other noble Lords will cover those important topics later in the debate.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para20"></a>In conclusion, I wish to turn to the future, to four weeks today when local authorities will know just how painful the cuts in their budgets must be next year. All of us wish the Secretary of State well in her much leaked quest to win more resources for education. But the additional &#163;800 million that she is allegedly seeking will not be enough even to achieve a standstill on this year's lamentable position, let alone to start repairing the years of neglect under this Government. Welcome though the additional money for education will be, such additional money as there may be for education must not come at the expense of other hard pressed local government services. If the Government mean their commitment to education, it must be new and not recycled money.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para21"></a>I do not expect the Minister in her reply to comment on the forthcoming budget or to reveal the Chancellor's secrets. Indeed, I understand that the Cabinet has not yet decided what those secrets are to be. Nor do I expect her to comment on the revenue support grant settlement two days later. But I hope that she will help with one particular issue which is causing increasing concern among those LEAs, my own included, which come under the common funding formula.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para22"></a>The CFF relates, of course, to secondary schools but there is a real fear that the proposals currently under consideration to move to a formula-based approach are likely to have the effect of shifting significant resources from primary to secondary schools. That would be entirely contrary to the general belief, supported by the House of Commons Select Committee on Education and, I believe, by the Government, that primary schools <P>


<a name="column_1548"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be the priority. The Minister can allay that anxiety today by giving an assurance that, whatever is finally decided, it will not have the effect of shifting resources away from primary education. Will she give us that assurance today?
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para23"></a>The Government say that education is their top priority but they seem more determined to achieve tax cuts than to invest in education. The Labour Party states that education is its top priority. It is committed to maximum class sizes of 30 in primary schools, but it will not say how or when that is to be achieved. Instead, it seems more interested in competing with the Conservatives as being the party of lowest tax.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para24"></a>Only we, the Liberal Democrats, say that education is our top priority and demonstrate our belief in that investment by being prepared, if necessary, to increase tax to pay for it. Some say that that commitment is brave and others that it is foolhardy. But at least it is honest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for giving the House this opportunity to discuss primary school education. It is the most important aspect of education because it lays the foundation for all subsequent learning.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para25"></a>As the Question focuses on resources, I expect that some of your Lordships will follow the noble Lord in concentrating on funding and financial resources. But the most important resource is the quality of teaching and the professionalism of the teaching staff. Therefore, in my contribution I wish to raise three issues. The first is to indicate why there is cause for concern about the levels of achievement of many pupils in the primary sector. Secondly, as a member of the board of the Teacher Training Agency, I wish to outline some of the initiatives under-taken by the TTA in its first year of operation to address the need to ensure that all teachers, including primary school teachers, are adequately prepared to fulfil their professional responsibilities. Thirdly, I wish to offer some additional suggestions and policy recommendations, not as a member of the TTA, but on the basis of my experience and on research undertaken by my colleague Dr. John Marks.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para26"></a>However, before highlighting causes of concern, I should like to pay a sincere tribute to many staff in many primary schools who give high quality education to their pupils in a happy environment with stimulating effective teaching and learning, reflected in high levels of attainment. Only yesterday, I had the great privilege of visiting Little Thurrock County Primary School. I came away inspired by the enthusiasm of the pupils, the commitment of teachers and the combination of achievement with happiness.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para27"></a>But, moving from the specific to the general, it needs to be pointed out that there does not seem to be any specific correlation between levels of financial resources and happy, effective schools. What has been shown again and again by research to be significant is the quality of leadership and of the professionalism of the teachers&#151;their subject knowledge and pedagogical skills, such as classroom management. So it is that research has shown that schools in the same catchment <P>


<a name="column_1549"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1549</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>area, with pupils from similar backgrounds and with similar levels of funding, may vary very dramatically in the quality of education offered to their pupils.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para28"></a>A particular area of concern in primary education must be the decline in effective teaching of literacy and numeracy. The research of Martin Turner has shown a disturbing fall in the number of children who can read by the age of seven and there are indications of increasing numbers of pupils leaving primary schools and entering secondary education with inadequate reading ability. If children cannot read, they cannot make any significant progress with the rest of their education. Ofsted's inspections to date have shown, with reference to English, that across all key stages standards of achievement are unsatisfactory or poor in one-fifth of our schools; that there are persistent weaknesses in teachers' knowledge and expertise about formal aspects of language, particularly grammar and syntax; that the quality of teaching at key stages 1 and 2 is unsatisfactory or poor in 23 per cent. of lessons; and that in both Key Stages 1 and 2, inadequate knowledge of the English language and appropriate literature are serious handicaps for some teachers.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para29"></a>In mathematics, there are concerns about standards of achievement in relation to pupils' capabilities in about one-third of primary schools. The quality of teaching has been found to be unsatisfactory or poor in 28 per cent. of lessons at key stage 1 and 30 per cent. of lessons at key stage 2 while teachers' command of mathematics is not adequate for the work they are required to teach in one-quarter of our schools at key stage 2. Such findings are very disturbing as, without basic mathematical understanding and skills, essential learning in many other subjects such as science and IT will inevitably be seriously impaired.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para30"></a>Other research, such as that undertaken by Professor Reynolds at the University of Newcastle, has shown serious problems, with excessive use of teaching primary school pupils in small groups instead of teaching a whole class at the same time in a more traditional way. Reference to that research may be found in an article in the Independent of 29th September this year under the heading "'Chaotic' Teaching methods attacked".
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para31"></a>It is in the context of such research findings and Ofsted reports that the claim by Her Majesty's chief inspector for schools, Chris Woodhead, that perhaps up to 15,000 teachers may be professionally inadequate needs to be taken very seriously. That is why, despite good and dedicated work being done by many teachers in many schools, the overall picture demonstrates the need for urgent remedial measures to bring all schools up to the level of the best. I refer once again to Ofsted's findings. Forty seven of the first 2,400 primary schools inspected have failed. The features which often characterise failing schools include under-achievement by pupils, a high proportion of poor or unsatisfactory teaching, and ineffective leadership. The question of resources does not feature in a positive correlation across the board by any means.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para32"></a>That brings me to the role of the TTA and its endeavours to promote the professionalism and competence of teachers. Time only permits me to give <P>


<a name="column_1550"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1550</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a few examples but in doing so I should like to express appreciation of the staff of the TTA who have worked phenomenally hard, in the first year of operation, to achieve clarity of objectives and to establish a programme which should address many of the problems which I have just identified.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para33"></a>I shall give the House five examples of TTA's current initiatives. The first is endeavouring to ensure that all teachers have necessary subject knowledge to underpin the subjects they teach. That applies to newly qualified teachers and will form part of the evaluation of initial teacher training courses; it will also apply to those who have been teaching for some time. For example, the TTA proposes to use in-service training to target subject co-ordinators in primary schools and key stage 2 teachers with poor subject knowledge, especially in mathematics, science, literacy and technology.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para34"></a>The second initiative is to set national standards as bench-marks for competent professional practice. A review of current provision of continuing professional development shows massive problems with mis-targeted and ad hoc training and funds being used in ways which have little impact on classroom practice. The TTA believes that the cornerstone of continuing professional development should be the establishment of standards of excellence for all teachers, from those newly qualified to head teachers.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para35"></a>The third initiative is to increase diversity of opportunities for access to initial teacher training in order to encourage into the profession a wider range of people who will help to remedy acute shortages of teachers in key subjects such as mathematics, science, RE, sports and music. In the fourth initiative, the TTA is promoting more direct involvement of primary schools in initial teacher training through partnerships between schools and higher education institutions with school-centred initial teacher training groups to help bridge the gap between theory and practice and to provide more appropriate, practical and apprenticeship-type experience for student teachers.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para36"></a>I turn now to the last initiative. The recent decline in pupils' achievements in key subject areas may well be associated with inappropriate teaching methods or classroom organisation such as the widespread move away from phonics teaching of reading or using small groups and discovery methods instead of teaching a whole class at the same time. By promoting research, the TTA hopes to establish best teaching practice and to encourage all teachers to ensure that their teaching is based on the most effective and proven methods. The initial priorities are effective teaching of literacy and numeracy as these are fundamental to all other forms of learning.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para37"></a>I wish to make two additional and brief points independent of my position on the board of the TTA. First, I should like to see the principles of openness and accountability which currently apply to secondary schools also apply to primary schools. I believe that it is in the interests of pupils, parents and local communities for schools to make publicly available information about their pupils' attainment&#151;such as reading and arithmetic scores at the ages of 7 and 11, <P>


<a name="column_1551"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>school by school. They would serve as bench-marks to indicate effectiveness of teaching; they would pick up problems at an early enough stage for remedial action to be taken; and they would enable parents to make the most appropriate choice of school for their children. I ask my noble friend the Minister whether the Government will publish such information as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para38"></a>I conclude with an unashamedly anecdotal story which illustrates two points; first, that we in the United Kingdom do not always compare favourably with pupils' attainment in other countries and that we should be asking ourselves why; and, secondly, that it may not be appropriate immediately to resort to the phrase "financial resources" as a reason for our under-achievement. Some of your Lordships may be aware that I have frequently visited the little war-torn enclave of Nagorny Karabakh where 150,000 Armenians have been fighting a desperate war for the right to survive in their ancient homeland. The capital city of Stepanakert was subjected to sustained bombardment at the height of the war, pounded by 400 rockets every day. Children spent months in basements and cellars and there is probably no family which has not lost at least one member.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para39"></a>I happened to be speaking in Streatham and a teacher who heard me asked whether I would establish a link scheme with a school in Stepanakert. I duly took a parcel of letters and gifts kindly provided by British children to 12 year-old pupils in School No. 8&#151;a typical Karabakh school&#151;blackened, and gutted by bombing and fire, with no windows, no electricity and no light or heat. The temperature was minus 10 degrees and pupils were sitting wrapped in coats, scarves and gloves. However, within one hour of my arrival with the parcel from the Streatham primary school each of those pupils in Stepanakert had written&#151;individually and with no help from their teachers&#151;a letter to one of the British pupils. The letters were written in beautiful English with better spelling than would be found in many a British school. Yet all those Karabakh children read and write Armenian; they all read and write Russian. English is their third language and their third script. I could not help asking myself how many British children aged 12 could read and write fluently with accurate spelling in a third language and a third script, however well resourced our schools might be.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para40"></a>I offer that vignette as a tribute to the courage of those Armenian children and their teachers who maintain high educational standards in the midst of extreme adversity and as a challenge to us in this country to ensure that we use our not inconsiderable resources to enable all our children to achieve their full potential in every primary school throughout the land.

<FONT SIZE=3>Government Finance. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Tope, on initiating a debate on this vitally important issue.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para41"></a>I wish to concentrate on two aspects of the need for increasing resources for primary education. Parents, governors and teachers understand that this year's settlement for education was inadequate. Concern has centred on school budgets but other areas are also under pressure such as special education, the Youth Service, adult education and discretionary awards.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para42"></a>Although there are worries about many aspects of resource levels for primary education, I wish to concentrate on one aspect in particular; namely, the case for reducing class sizes in primary schools. I thank the National Foundation for Educational Research for the work it has done in this field and the advice it has made available to me. Research evidence shows that reviewers of work on class sizes suggested that the effect of reducing class size was greatest for younger children, especially those who are low achievers or who come from socially or economically disadvantaged groups. I refer in particular to the STAR (student-teacher achievement ratio) research that has been done in America. I acknowledge that that research deals with class sizes of between 13 to 17 pupils and 22 to 25 pupils. I wish to draw attention to the findings of that research. The results were consistent. In reading and mathematics pupils in smaller classes performed significantly better and teacher aids did not redress the difference. The results showed a special advantage for ethnic minorities. Those differences continued four years after the original experiment. A similar study was established in Indiana.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para43"></a>There has been too little research into the reasons why small classes resulted in better achievement in the experiment. Much of the research undertaken was started late in the STAR programme. However, teachers of the experimental classes have identified the following benefits of small classes. They found that smaller classes were quieter, with fewer student interruptions. Students in smaller classes showed more appreciation for one another and a greater desire to participate in classroom activities. Potential disciplinary problems could be identified and resolved more quickly. More learning activities took place, and students participated more often in them. Teachers had more time to monitor students' on-task behaviour and were able to provide quicker and more thorough feedback to students, to reteach concepts as needed and to provide in-depth instruction. Greater individualisation of instruction in the smaller classes significantly reduced the need for reteaching and greater interaction among students helped them understand one another and increased their desire to help one another.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para44"></a>It is particularly important to consider that the greatest effect on learning is achieved when numbers are reduced to below 20 pupils in a class. That argument has been used in your Lordships' House by the Minister's predecessor that to make any noticeable or appreciable difference to the quality of education it is necessary to reduce class sizes to below 20.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para45"></a>However, parents believe that the ideal level is difficult to attain, and they accept that the position may continue to worsen. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has demonstrated, in the past three years the provision for primary school education has worsened. The OECD figures in Education at a Glance 1992 show that within the UK the children of Scotland have a maximum class size of 33 pupils to one teacher. The maximums in other countries vary. In Denmark it is 28 to one&#151;the average being 19 to one&#151;in Finland the maximum is 25 to one in the first two years; in Spain it is 25 to one in the primary years; and in Portugal it is 30 to one and 20 to one respectively (the ratio of 20 to one occurs where handicapped pupils are integrated in the class).
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para46"></a>I wish to refer to special educational needs. Approximately 20 per cent. of children are estimated at some time to have special educational needs. Approximately 2 per cent. of these have the most serious and severe special educational needs. Some 18 per cent. of the children with special educational needs are not statemented and are not protected in terms of the resources that are available to them. It is also the case that the concentration of children with special educational needs is not evenly distributed. I listened carefully to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I believe it is invidious to make league table comparisons between one primary school where 45 per cent. of its children may have non-statemented special educational needs and another where 10 per cent. of its children have such needs.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para47"></a>It is quite obvious that at all stages special educational needs of pupils place even greater emphasis on the need for additional teacher support and time, especially in the case of very young children. For teaching to be effective and for learning to be effective it is necessary for the teacher to learn about individual pupils and their problems. Not all children live in homes that are free of problems and difficulties. Many of our teachers find that to enable a child to learn properly they must establish links with the child's home and they have to spend time listening to the child.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para48"></a>Another argument that is used is that resource levels and class sizes are not important but that the quality of the teacher is the most important factor. I readily agree that the quality of the teacher is the most important factor, but effective learning necessitates periods of individual assistance for individual children. There must be a reason why,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Teachers in independent schools teach on average about 60 per cent. of the number of pupils taught by teachers in the maintained sector", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para49"></a>according to the Oxford Review of Education 1994. I ask your Lordships to question whether it is credible that parents are paying for&#151;and schools are providing&#151;an unnecessary and extravagant level of teacher resource for their children's education in the independent sector. I cannot believe that that is the case. We must begin to reverse the trend of larger class sizes and establish a situation where all our children can learn, study, develop and grow in their primary school years, with a smaller number of pupils in classes.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para50"></a>Reference was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, to the need to improve the quality of the teaching profession. It is quite clear from research done in the late 1970s and early 1980s that many people had been recruited into the teaching profession who did not even have the equivalent of a GCSE O-level in mathematics. The solution is not to describe the problem but rather to consider effective means for rectifying that shortfall. I know from my experience in Lancashire that curriculum co-ordinators constitute one of the most effective ways of ensuring that teachers' professional skills are developed and enhanced. But that is a resource. Effective curriculum co-ordination involves supply teacher cover so that teachers can be absent from their own schools to work with a mentor in another school.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para51"></a>Teachers have to combat the fact that in society fewer people read and fewer people write and we live in a rapidly changing world. We must not castigate the teaching profession; we must understand its difficulties. Comparisons and league tables will not solve the problems in our education service. I remember a farmer explaining to me, when we were talking about a rural primary school's needs, that he had never found that you fattened a pig by weighing it.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para52"></a>It is critically important that we listen to the parents in this country. We can discuss research and we can bandy figures about, but at the end of the day the parents know that in a class of 40 their child will not get the attention it needs compared with a child in a class of 20 or 25. I support the view put in the Question.

<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew8"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of St. Edmundsbury and Ipswich: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for enabling this short debate to take place. I hardly need declare my own stake in the educational system, or at least that of the Churches. The Church of England has 4,653 primary schools in the maintained sector, and the Roman Catholic Church, with which I am happy to say we now work in close partnership at all levels, has a further 1,874 primary schools. That is a substantial stake, into which the Churches together put immense resources, not only in terms of finance but also in terms of personal commitment, individual gifts, and so forth.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para53"></a>Our concern is not simply with regard to our own schools but with regard to the resourcing of the system as a whole. At all levels education is dependent on collaboration and co-operation between various groups. For it to be effective that co-operation has to be substantial and based on trust. That is particularly so in primary education.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para54"></a>In all education the first group to be considered is the children themselves, for whom the system exists and without whose goodwill it could not operate.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para55"></a>For many years a major player in this country has been, and probably always will be, the Government. The Government merit some congratulations. They have shown great commitment to education over the past years. They have raised the frequency of school inspections, given schools greater control over the <P>


<a name="column_1555"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>budgets allocated to them, reviewed the national curriculum and raised the profile of religious education and worship in our schools.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para56"></a>The ability of the other groups involved in education to contribute to the benefit of the whole is affected by financial resources or the lack of them. The first of those groups is the local education authority. In my own county of Suffolk the LEA is widely admired in all quarters, irrespective of the political party which happens to be in control at any time. Its guidance and support has been crucial for teachers and governors alike in this period of great change, as has my own LEA's spirit of consultation and partnership with the local community. I have no doubt that that reflects what other local education authorities are achieving. However, at a time when the LEA needs to give even greater support to schools it faces a situation in which those resources are far more stretched.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para57"></a>The second group is the teachers. Teaching, thank God, is still a vocation. Most of those who teach do so because they believe in what they are doing and in the goodwill and happiness of their pupils, and in increasing their confidence and knowledge. Because teachers regard teaching as a vocation, the teaching profession today still works well beyond the call of duty in terms of time given and effort involved. Anyone who visits a primary school, which is the subject of our debate today, will recognise how true that is. In the past year the work involved in changes to the curriculum has imposed great strain on the teaching profession, and teachers have shown great diligence and professional expertise. However, it is a matter of concern to see how great that strain is and the high fallout rate of teachers leaving the profession because of stress.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para58"></a>Then there are the parents. Primary schools are particularly dependent upon parents for support, not only in the classroom but at all levels, and not only in respect of their own children but for the school as a whole. Sometimes the fund-raising efforts in which parents are inevitably involved are not for ancillary equipment but for what most would regard as essential equipment.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para59"></a>The final group is the governors. The governors are volunteers to a woman and a man. They are public spirited people who give a great deal of time and effort to the wellbeing of the school which they serve. I note how often today governors find themselves in the front line when difficult decisions have to be made. They can be opposed or criticised by teachers and/or by parents when having to make difficult decisions, particularly about staffing reductions. We need to bear them in mind for the voluntary work that they do for the wellbeing of society and of children. I stand alongside them in their difficulties.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para60"></a>The problems which the primary school sector faces are many. I want to cite three. The first is the need for adequate resourcing of the changes in the national curriculum. I do not want to expand on that point.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para61"></a>The second problem is the maintaining of adequate staffing levels of sufficient quality to do the job which our schools and teachers have been given. I have been <P>


<a name="column_1556"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interested in the exchange that has taken place on the size of classes and what the optimum size should be. Such observations as I have made on this subject lead me to believe that if the national curriculum is to work effectively the optimum class size should not be more than 25. However, in fact many classes are well above that figure, as has been mentioned.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para62"></a>Perhaps I may put in a word for small local rural schools. Many in my own diocese are in that category. In a small school it is inevitable that some classes will have a wide age range among the children within them. It is not uncommon for classes to span key stages, which leads to greater complexity in the teaching process.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para63"></a>The third area of concern is the maintenance and improving of school buildings. Many are old; and even those which were built post-war were built to a poor standard and are inadequate to meet the demands of the modern curriculum.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para64"></a>Perhaps I may make an aside on the question of the funding formulas. The historic formulas used to determine school budgets are seen by many primary school teachers as favouring the secondary sector. If there were any suggestion that they should favour the secondary sector even more that would be immensely unpopular and unjust. The balance of funding between the primary and secondary sectors needs to be addressed, but not by switching the current limited resources between the two. New funding has to be found to raise the level of resourcing per primary school.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para65"></a>Many people will be surprised at how much time a bishop spends in schools. I frequently visit the many schools in my diocese, addressing assemblies, going round classrooms, meeting teachers, governors and children. It is an experience which I always find of immense value. I say as an aside that what appears to be most popular in schools is when I go along with my suitcase and dress up in episcopal fancy dress for them! Apart from that, the joy that is often felt in our primary schools is substantial, the goodwill and commitment that exist are as great as they ever were.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para66"></a>As regards the improvements that have been made in our educational system, there have been welcome reforms; but it must now be recognised that the full benefit of those will only be felt in primary schools if the level of resources is found to enable the governors and teachers effectively to undertake the tasks which we give them, for our children. If that cannot be achieved, then we shall continue to see the bricks in the foundations of education being made without straw.

<A NAME="51103-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for providing this occasion to discuss our primary schools. While it is commonplace to stress the vital role of education in any society, we in Britain have too often been inclined to focus at the top end: on the quality of our universities, of the graduates they produce and of the research they cultivate. This has had the costly effect of our neglecting the lower levels of education on which, of course, universities themselves depend to supply each new generation of their undergraduates.
<P>


<a name="column_1557"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para67"></a>Happily, through the debates in recent years that led to the Education Act 1988 and the establishment of a national curriculum, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the Office for Standards in Education and, more recently, the Teacher Training Agency, the focus has increasingly shifted to where it truly belongs, to the schooling of the under-16s and especially to primary education&#151;to the crucial first four or five years of schooling. These are the years in which children should learn to read and write and handle numbers. They are also the years in which children should learn good behaviour, to know right from wrong, to respect others, to admire kindness and shun cruelty, to take personal pride in their appearance and in their achievement.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para68"></a>In none of these respects can we be satisfied with current outcomes of primary education, and thanks to widespread awareness of public inspection and of international comparisons, we are also more conscious in this country of our educational shortcomings than at any time, certainly within my own lifetime.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para69"></a>We have at last started taking real action, but we must be prepared for a very long haul with no simple quick solutions. We have started targeting failing schools, but that will not be enough. We now have in place a wider range of educational provision and are developing a culture of parental choice. But that will not be enough. It is high time we got rid of the large numbers of inadequate teachers that Ofsted tells us about this very day. But even that will not be enough.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para70"></a>Nor, I feel, is it enough to call for more resources. It is true that I find the sharp difference between the per capita expenditure at primary level and that at secondary level impossible to justify, but in all schools this per capita expenditure has increased with phenomenal steepness during the past 50 years without producing the results we need.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para71"></a>On 1st November we were warned of what amounts to a crisis in the teaching of basic maths in our schools. The joint report by the London Mathematical Society and associated bodies was not, however, complaining about a lack of resources: indeed, schools' failure to teach the elements of this crucial subject seems in part at least rather to be attributable to the over-provision of resources in the shape of calculators and computers which lead to the neglect of skills such as mental arithmetic and tables. Maths, we are told moreover, has been thoroughly undermined by teachers "imbued with trendy theories".
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para72"></a>To move, for a moment, from purely primary education, on that same day, 1st November, the press carried reports of the recommendation to close Hackney Downs school. The failure here does not seem, at more than &#163;6,000 per pupil, to have resulted from lack of resources either. Nor yet to that other focus of attention: large class sizes. Indeed, during the crucial period of the final opportunity for improvement, the school has had the good fortune of a pupil-teacher ratio of eight to one. No; what we read in the excerpts from the team's report published in the press is of teachers writing the words "very good" and even "excellent" on what the report describes as illiterate work,

<P>

<a name="51103-06_para73"></a>in a school characterised by "poor teaching", "weak management" and the "uncontrolled behaviour" of pupils.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para74"></a>The pupils there are now to be transferred to Homerton school, but whether or not this has superior resources despite the complaints there of crime and bullying, one thing seems to me to be perfectly clear: Hackney Downs school and those like it have had resources beyond the dreams of the little Manx Cronk y Voddy school at which I received my early education&#151;and incomparably superior financial and physical resources to those endured by the primary schools which serve the millions in South Africa's black townships.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para75"></a>I mention these because my wife and I visited one such mean and graceless township in September this year: Mamelodi, east of Pretoria. We were totally uplifted by the bearing of the hundreds of little boys and girls we saw and talked to. Their alertly interested eyes, their neat and clean uniformed dress&#151;all of this was more redolent of prep school children in leafy Surrey than of youngsters who trudged to school along ill-kept, dusty and dispiriting streets from homes that ranged from humble four-roomed cubes to no-roomed galvanised hovels. Their enthusiasm for education was manifest, as was their well-disciplined behaviour, both in class and on the streets. When we later talked to the Provincial Minister of Education in Johannesburg, she unhesitatingly put it all down to family support for schooling and parental determination that their children should achieve a better deal than they themselves had had.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para76"></a>We should ponder the lesson of such examples. What our primary schools most need is something that money cannot buy: a total transformation in our national educational culture, and if resources come into it, they are primarily a matter of moral and aspirational resources. We need to write a determined and enthusiastic contract between teachers, parents and pupils; this contract needs to speak with confidence of our will to make the best possible use of the most precious resources we could possibly have: our children themselves.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para77"></a>Now, we all know of cases where just such a contract is already established. We all know of individual schools up and down the country; yes, and far beyond. The most impressive models I happen to have seen personally have been in the schools of Gibraltar. The models, the examples, the good practice exist, but we must find ways of publicising and spreading good practice of this kind.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para78"></a>None of this is to deny, of course, the need for adequate tax-derived finance. But it is deeply misleading and a dangerous diversion from more fundamental issues to give the impression that our educational deficiencies can be made good with mere money.

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1559</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para79"></a>To the question of whether or not we have enough resources in our educational system, the answer will always be no. The real question is: can we resolve the difficulty and can we find enough resources to meet certain problems within a certain time? I suggest that at the moment, if we have the will, we can. But we do not have the will. It is for us to make our own individual judgments as to whether it is a matter of screwing up political courage and facing certain economic realities. But the fact remains that more resources could be found. As a society we could put more economic resources into our schools and that would lead in turn to other types of resources being available.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para80"></a>By education, we mean instilling forms of knowledge into people via others. Therefore the first consideration is the teachers themselves and the ways in which they are prepared to provide information for their pupils. A teacher's state of mind must therefore be considered. Teachers must not be undermined; their position must be supported. In a society in which, increasingly, the pay packet determines status, we must look long and hard at the professional position of our teachers. Teaching may be a vocation for certain people, but very few can undertake a vocation when they cannot eat. We must always bear that in mind.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para81"></a>I shall concentrate for a few moments on the area of special educational needs. It is necessarily one in which class sizes are vitally important, especially when taking into account types of disability that are hidden. It will come as no surprise to many in this Chamber if I direct my remarks primarily to the issue of dyslexia. I must declare an interest as vice-president of the British Dyslexia Association. It is a non-pecuniary position. Indeed, if it were paid I think I should be entitled to overtime by this stage.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para82"></a>For dyslexics, class size is vitally important since the problem is very difficult to spot. We do not train our teachers across the board to spot this difficulty. With a problem such as this, all that one can realistically hope to do is get most teachers to understand what the problem is. Then, one will also hopefully get them to understand that they do not have enough expertise to go in and blunder around with the problem because they are inappropriately trained. In dyslexia, as in many other types of disability, the learning curve is different. Giving such people more, and harder, work does not help. It makes the problem worse. To overload somebody whose motor-neurones are differently connected&#151;in their learning curve they have difficulty with fine detail, number sequencing, etc, and in certain situations with interpreting written symbols&#151;in all disciplines in this type of environment or to give the wrong type of help, no matter how good-naturedly, can be destructive.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para83"></a>Thus, it is vitally important to have teachers trained to do the job properly. At the moment, teacher training is something of a curate's egg. It is good in parts. Unfortunately, this particular curate does not get a very good meal out of it, because the parts that are good to eat are not a majority. We do not have a comprehensive strategy for dealing with this type of environment.
<P>


<a name="column_1560"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para84"></a>Also, if we consider that a figure approaching 10 per cent. of the population has this problem to a degree, and something like 2 per cent. to 3 per cent. of the population will need specific help because of it, there is a real difficulty. Class size is vitally important. If a child with this disability or one of a similar type is placed in a classroom situation&#151;there is so much evidence to support this view that I do not need to back it up here&#151;his first instinct will be to try to survive within the classroom situation by doing one of two things. First, he may keep quiet, smile happily and hope that the teacher will not pick on him and give him a hard time. The classroom environment is not primarily very friendly, owing to the presence of other children round him. His other mode of survival is to become disruptive. While he is being disruptive, the class cannot function properly round him and therefore he is not exposed to the ridicule of his peers.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para85"></a>If we give the correct type of training in this sphere&#151;and there are many others where there are similar types of problem, with names which sound vaguely similar but which refer to very different difficulties; for instance, dysphasia&#151;to enable the difficulty to be spotted, we should be able to eliminate major problems in the classroom. If the class is very large, with one pupil sitting quietly at the back not wanting to be noticed and one person trying to cause trouble, there is immediately a situation where one is ignored and another has all the attention in the world, though not for learning problems, and the people about them suffer.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para86"></a>Streaming cannot be done effectively in primary schools. It just cannot happen. Many are too small to allow for that. Pupils must be in classes of a manageable size where problems can be spotted. One thing we do know about teaching methods is that they vary with the individual child. There is no correct teaching method, even without any particular problems. Everybody has a different learning curve. Unless we address the correct training to deal with these types of difficulty, we shall not be fair to the children with those individual problems. We shall also be damaging those in the classroom who do not suffer from them.

<A NAME="51103-06_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Brigstocke: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the gap. I heard about this timely debate only yesterday on my return from the United States. On the subject of resources to improve the quality of education in primary schools, I want to make one point only. It relates to the importance of raising the reading standards of all primary schoolchildren from the very earliest age.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para87"></a>Dramatic and relevant research has been done on this subject in the United States. Evidently from birth to the age of six, children, without anyone realising it, receive approximately 3,000 hours of pre-literacy training. That comes about from the mother or the father reading to the child, and even from parents watching children's programmes such as "Sesame Street" with them, and even putting magnetic numbers or letters on the fridge. In contrast, an inner-city child can receive as little as 20 to 200 hours of this kind of personal help which we <P>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>call pre-literacy training. These figures refer to the United States. I believe that they are near enough to the UK experience to make it worth taking note of them.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para88"></a>I am particularly interested in a pilot programme run by the Waterford Institute in Provo, Utah. It gives each child in kindergarten&#151;that is, five year-olds&#151; 15 minutes on the computer on a very special focused programme, one that is focused to teach early learning skills. Findings in one school in Provo are indeed dramatic. The activities of the kindergarten tested were five: whether the child can recite the alphabet from memory; recognise 23 or more capital letters; match sounds with 20 or more capital letters; recite at least 10 nursery rhymes and songs; and, lastly, understand basic print concepts&#151; that is, where to begin to read, in which direction to read, to circle a word or to circle a letter.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para89"></a>In 1994 measurement was taken of a class of five year-olds and the lower performing children. Those would be the weakest pupils, probably with special educational needs that have not been identified. One class was tested and the eight children who were performing worst and were clearly the least academic could do 15.6 per cent. of those activities. In 1995 the results with the same teacher teaching the kindergarten of that year showed that 87.5 per cent. of those lowest performing children could do those activities because they had used the software programme on the computer.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para90"></a>I commend the use of such a software programme for our kindergarten five year-olds. It will need initial investment, but if in this country the weakest five year-olds can be given a head start, they will have a much better chance of keeping up in the later stages of their schooling.

<A NAME="51103-06_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, I have listened to the whole of this debate and, in the very few minutes before the winding-up speeches, I should like to say how extremely refreshing it was for me to hear the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, who is certainly a member of the educational establishment. I do not think that I have ever heard a member of that establishment hit quite so many educational nails on the head in the time available, as he did. The disadvantage of hearing his speech is that I may be tempted to send him my maiden speech of some six years ago. But perhaps we can discuss that later.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para91"></a>To me, however, the ace in this debate was served by my noble friend Lady Cox. I recommend particularly to the Liberal and Social Democrat Front Benches that they refresh their memories on what she said and the story that she told of the children in Ngorno Karabakh. I have read some, if not all, of the letters to which she referred, written by children of 12 years-old in their third alphabet. When we consider the war torn and entirely resource-free class-rooms in which those children learned their skills, we must be very careful before we espouse the resource argument too fully. I might also add that my understanding is that those children are all taught in classes which are very much larger than 30.

<a name="51103-06_para92"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, mentioned the low academic quality of some of the intake to the teaching profession which, unfortunately, took place in the 1970s and more particularly in the 1980s. I hope that it is not entirely inappropriate for me to ask my noble friend on the Front Bench whether the question of "Mum's Army" has indeed been so ridiculed as to be entirely dismissed by the education establishment in this country. I should have thought that we have many experienced mothers who have looked after children successfully and who have a background of good A-levels and good degrees, especially in the shortage subjects.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para93"></a>Having listened to the whole debate this afternoon, I should have thought that that was an issue that the Government would do well to revive and resist the blandishments of the educational establishment.

<P>
<A NAME="51103-06_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for providing us with the opportunity, even on a Friday in November, to discuss this difficult but vitally important question.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para94"></a>It is our duty to achieve, if we can, the greatest measure of justice and equity for the children of the United Kingdom and at the very heart of this debate has been the perception that there lies some unjustified disparity between the funding of children at the primary and secondary stages of education. Local management of schools has revealed many important issues about the funding of schools, because so much more information is now available. The House of Commons Education Committee reports HC45, I and II, have studied the question in great detail, to our infinite profit. The broad thrust of its reports is that the disparity between primary and secondary funding is too great and cannot be justified.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para95"></a>As we all know, the amount of money available for expenditure on particular items in a primary or secondary school is determined first by the Government, through public expenditure control and the standard spending assessment system; secondly, by the local authorities setting their budgets and LMS formulae; and, thirdly, by the schools themselves in the way in which they use their resources.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para96"></a>But the trouble begins when we realise that the total SSA for each part of the service is closely based on past spending patterns; and past expenditure on primary and secondary schools by LEAs obviously has a strong influence on the starting point for SSA distribution. Forecasting population trends is a notoriously difficult exercise and one would need the combined skills of the proto-Isaiah and Mystic Meg to be able to prophesy shifts in birth rate, family mobility and parent choice in such a way as to ensure fair funding for primary schools in every part of the United Kingdom. So the disparity remains a central problem and, as the Education Committee's first conclusion makes clear, creates difficulty in ensuring that:
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para97"></a>I stress the word "needs"&#151;

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of pupils [are] properly taken into account in assessing the levels of funding for each sector". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para98"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, in answering this debate, will demonstrate to us how the Government propose to assess relative needs and build them into a formula which will be fair to the primary schools.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para99"></a>In its report, the committee makes a, to my mind, unanswerable case for a change on the question of class size and the staffing issues involved. I have been profoundly unimpressed with such pieces of research as have come my way which purport to prove that, except in exceptional circumstances, class size does not correlate with achievement. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, wisely said, common sense tells us that the one must affect the other. That fact is supported by all those parents who can afford independent schools and wish to have them for their offspring and who invariably say that class size and individual attention were one of the determinants in their choice.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para100"></a>That relates closely to the committee's Conclusion 13, in which it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the light of evidence received, we are satisfied that there is insufficient monitoring and support time available to staff in primary schools ... To achieve the staffing flexibility required ... it is necessary to work towards a common pupil:teacher ratio across the full range of primary and secondary school pupils of statutory age". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
 Although we on this side of the House heartily concur and agree, we realise that that could cost an appreciable amount of money, particularly in the primary sector. That is why we support so strongly the alleviation of the disparity between primary and secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para101"></a>All 31 of the committee's recommendations seem sensible and practical. So it is with a considerable sense of disappointment that one reads the Government's response, which, despite its smooth platitudes and specious side-steps, produces very little in the way of intellectual argument and seems complacently contented with the status quo. Without going through it in detail, it seems fair to say that the Government consider nearly all these matters to be an LEA responsibility and note that LEA decisions to shift expenditure will "eventually" be reflected in changed SSA sub-block; or, to put it another way, the Government's mechanism for funding will reflect LEA decisions which, over the past few years, have reduced the differential between primary and secondary sectors to some extent.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para102"></a>There is some obvious truth in that. But it has been reliably estimated that it could take as long as three years for the LEA decision to be reflected in the SSA sub-block, during which time the situation and the decisions may change two or three times and be complicated by new, related decisions, so that, in Shakespeare's phrase, "chaos is come again".
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para103"></a>And, looming over the whole problem like a thunder cloud is the presence of that great arcane mystery, the common funding formula. Many well-informed people seem to be convinced that the operation of the CFF will be bound to take money away from primary schools. The concern centres on the consultation document on the top slice and the problems associated with splitting <P>


<a name="column_1564"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1564</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the ordinary, special and support costs in proportions of 86:9:5 and the financial disadvantage that that is thought to bring to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para104"></a>Just what impact that would have on the present perceived disparity between primary and secondary funding seems impossible to compute and, indeed, I must confess that I&#151;like many others&#151;find the common funding formula and its implications totally incomprehensible. I hope that the noble Baroness, if she does nothing else in reply to this debate, can bring some light to this matter and explain to the House, and through it to a baffled world beyond, how on earth the system will work and how it will impact upon the primary school. I realise that the noble Baroness may have to take a little advice in order to say anything at all about the problem and I shall be perfectly satisfied if the department writes to me in due course. It is an important point.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para105"></a>The degree of complexity in the funding business between secondary and primary schools is utterly unparalleled in the education history of this country. It can be contemplated by large primary schools in cities. But in small, rural primary schools&#151;and there are many of them&#151;the complexity and inflexibility of the funding process and its constant, restless process of change, creates problems of such an order that time which should be devoted to teaching has to be surrendered to administration.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para106"></a>I spoke recently to a head teacher of a village primary school with small numbers, high standards and a wide catchment area. His greatest perpetual problem was staffing. If a dozen or so children in one year go on to secondary education, but only half a dozen come to school for the first time (and such figures are often not known until very close to the beginning of the school year), he faces a cut of around &#163;5,000. The job of one staff member is instantly at risk in a school which may have a total staff as small as three. That cannot be lifted out of any reserves because there are no reserves. All possible resources have to be given to staffing. Fortunately, he has built up an excellent parent teacher association, but he relies totally on its ability, its charity, to raise at least &#163;1,000 a year. He must have it.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para107"></a>Is it not, to say the least, unbecoming that teachers and parents have to resort to such wheezes as an auction of promises, a harvest festival sale, or the children themselves in villages miles away from their school getting up a pathetic little stall on a pavement and trying to sell Coca Cola to tourists to fund 0.5 of a teacher for another risky year? Last year, because there were no reserves in that school, the parents painted the school themselves, top to bottom. And because the school could not afford a television set, one father trained for and ran a half marathon simply to pull in the money through sponsorship.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para108"></a>Yet that head teacher is in some ways lucky. Very few inner city primary schools can boast a cohort of such supportive parents. What is not realised in the hallowed halls of the DFEE is that the paperwork now required from a small primary school has the same weight as that from a school five times its size. So it has to be done in the holidays, or at weekends, or at night.

<a name="51103-06_para109"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, in her reply, will be able to explain to the House why such complexity, such opaqueness and such inflexibility and perpetual change are essential to primary school funding, because I can assure her that many of those at the sharp end, at the chalk face, whose profession and whose desire is simply to teach children, are sick and tired of it.

<A NAME="51103-06_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, this has been a most stimulating debate on a very important issue and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for the opportunity to look at funding for and standards in primary schools. My noble friend Lord Henley regrets that he is unable to be here today to speak. I am happy to take his place. I only hope that I can do justice to the excellent contributions in the short time available to me. If at the end of the day I do not answer everybody's questions, and those of the noble Lord, Lord Morris, in particular, I shall read Hansard carefully and ensure that everybody receives a written reply.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para110"></a>This Government have an excellent record in the funding of education and in raising standards in our schools. This Government are committed to high quality education. We have massively increased resources and introduced wide-ranging and fundamental reforms. Spending per pupil in nursery, primary and secondary schools has risen in real terms by almost 50 per cent. since 1979. Spending on teachers has risen by some 50 per cent.; on support staff by over 135 per cent.; on books and equipment by 55 per cent.; and on repairs and maintenance by 15 per cent.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para111"></a>Our funding bears international comparison. We spend a higher proportion of GDP on education than do Germany or Japan. In his most recent annual report for 1993-94 Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In overall terms the provision of resources is satisfactory". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para112"></a>Public expenditure on education, as on other services, must be commensurate with what the country can afford. Your Lordships will agree that a responsible government must consider the effect of public spending on the economy as a whole. This year's settlement was necessarily a tough one. Even so, the Government increased provision for spending on schools by over 1 per cent. The right reverend Prelate mentioned total capital allocations for county and voluntary controlled schools. This year they amounted to &#163;426 million, a rise of 6 per cent.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para113"></a>We have made it plain to local authorities that we look to them to give priority to front-line services in schools. They can and should look at ways of cutting their costs. They still spend millions on running their central bureaucracies. A report from the Audit Commission earlier this year found that authorities had scope across their services as a whole for saving &#163;500 million on the payroll for their administrative and clerical staff. As part of their discretion and use of funds it is also for local authorities to decide on the balance of funding between primary schooling and other parts of the eduction service. In recent years local authorities have chosen to reduce the disparity in funding between <P>


<a name="column_1566"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primary and secondary schools. Ministers welcome the active consideration of relative needs which that displays.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, asked about the common funding formula, as did several other noble Lords. The common funding formula is for secondary schools. That will remain the case in 1996-97. Any extension beyond that will have to take careful account of the position of primary schools.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para115"></a>The noble Lord also made much of class sizes, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, the noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Morris, and my noble friend Lady Brigstocke. But in fact, fewer than 30 per cent. of primary pupils were in classes of over 30 in January 1995 compared with more than 35 per cent. in 1979; 108,000 primary pupils were in classes of 36 and over, which compares with more than double that number&#151;220,000&#151;in 1979 before the work that we have done. Research also shows that intervention to improve teaching standards is much more important than class sizes.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para116"></a>Funding for next year is under consideration as part of the present public expenditure survey. I cannot predict the outcome of that consideration. What I can say is that Ministers have listened carefully and will take account of all the views expressed; and the Prime Minister indicated that education will be at the top of the Government's priorities as the economy delivers further growth.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para117"></a>Our solid record contrasts with the vague promises made by the opposition parties. The Liberal Democrats say that they will spend an extra &#163;2 billion on education and will be happy to pay for that with an additional 1p on the basic rate of income tax. Yet when he visited the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election, the Liberal Democrats education spokesman, Don Foster, was forced to concede that his party's education proposals alone would require an extra 2.5p on the basic rate if they were to be implemented immediately.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para118"></a> However, money does not provide the whole story, as the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, pointed out. It is necessary to have the right structures in place so that our professionals can deliver the quality of education at all levels to which they and we are committed. The Government's policy has been to build on those structures a policy which, as the chief inspector of schools has confirmed, is raising the quality of education. At the heart of this policy to raise standards lies the national curriculum and its assessment arrangements.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para119"></a>My noble friend Lady Brigstocke referred to the importance of pre-school training. That is why the Government are introducing for the first time an opportunity for nursery education for all four year-olds from April 1997 with pilots starting next year. I agree with noble Lords that it is particularly important in primary schools that we put emphasis firmly on the basis of literacy and numeracy. The noble Lord, Lord Quirk, pointed that out, particularly in the matter of mathematics. But the national curriculum is doing that. Independent Ofsted inspections show that its introduction has already improved the teaching of <P>


<a name="column_1567"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mathematics, especially in the early years where it is particularly important. That is better evidence than the personal opinions of some people.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para120"></a>In English, for example, there is now more emphasis on grammar, spelling and punctuation as well as on the need for pupils to be taught written and spoken standard English. The standards expected of primary pupils have been raised. And because we have reduced the content of the primary curriculum outside English and mathematics, primary teachers will now have more time to devote to teaching and the essentials of reading, writing and arithmetic.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para121"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, drew attention to the scope for improvement in primary school standards. But in English key stage 1, if 18 per cent. of the lessons were poor, 28 per cent. were found to be good or very good. It is important to remember the good findings alongside the warnings in the chief inspector's report.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para122"></a>There is no point in establishing national standards through the national curriculum if there is no means of measuring how far pupils match up. Rigorous and regular assessment of pupils' progress provides a litmus test of whether standards nationally are rising or falling so that parents can hold schools to account and so that teachers and parents can tell how individual pupils are faring. I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, on the influence that parents should have. The Government's policies are directed to giving more information to parents and making schools more responsive to parents. While talking about parents, my noble friend Lord Pearson mentioned the "Mums' Army". Parents are always very useful but that is no substitute for trained teachers.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para123"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, suggested that we should require primary schools to provide information about pupils' attainments. The principles of openness and accountability are very important. That is why all maintained schools are required to publish the national curriculum results of seven year-olds in reading, writing and mathematics and of 11 year-olds in English, mathematics and science in their school prospectuses and in the governors' annual reports. We are seeing the <P>


<a name="column_1568"></a>

<B>3 Nov 1995 : Column 1568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>benefits of these reforms. More than 43 per cent. of 15 year-olds achieved five or more GCSEs at grade C or better in 1994. That compares with 33 per cent. in 1989. I could give the House many more figures but I am mindful of the time. I shall not give them at this stage.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para124"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, asked about special needs. The code of practice for special educational needs will ensure systematic attention to the position of these pupils. This statementing process ensures that resources are deployed in response to their needs. As the national curriculum continues to bed down, we can expect to see standards at all levels continue to improve. Within four years nearly 25,000 schools will have been inspected. I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for complimenting the Government on bringing in this testing and inspection. More than 19,000 of the schools to be inspected will be primary schools. Under the old, more ad hoc arrangements, there would have been a gap of close to two centuries between full-scale primary inspections.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Quirk, drew attention to the matter of Hackney Downs. Where schools do not improve, more radical action must be taken. In the case of Hackney Downs school, that meant the establishment of an education association. As your Lordships will be aware, that association has recommended that the school should close. The Secretary of State has told the school and Hackney LEA that she is minded to agree with its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="51103-06_para126"></a>The Government have set new requirements for primary teacher training courses&#151;many noble Lords have mentioned the standard of teaching&#151;which require students to spend more time in schools learning from and working alongside effective teachers. I am well aware that I have been allowed only 11 minutes to speak and so I shall have to stop. The time was very short. I believe that there are one or two points which I have not covered. As I said at the beginning, I shall read Hansard very carefully and make sure that every matter that was raised is dealt with in the appropriate manner.

<P>
<UL>What was the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Luxembourg on 24&#150;25 October.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51103w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The Council adopted by qualified majority an amended Commission proposal enabling member states to pay national aids, under defined conditions, to farmers who had experienced considerable income losses as a result of significant currency depreciation in other member states. The original proposal was opposed by the UK, Italy and Sweden&#151;comprising 24 votes&#151;which meant it could not be adopted if a member state invoked the Council Decision reflecting the agreement reached at Ioannina in Greece on 27 March 1994. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food invoked this Decision, thereby requiring the Council to seek a basis for agreement involving at least 65 votes; that is, with fewer than 23 votes opposing or abstaining. As a consequence of this, the proposal was amended, in particular to require aid payments to be reduced or cancelled if currency depreciations were subsequently reversed. Although this was a significant and welcome improvement, it went less far than my right honourable <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would have liked. He therefore abstained on the vote. Italy voted against and Sweden in favour.
<P>

<a name="51103w01_para12"></a>The Council also discussed reform of the rice regime and held a first discussion of the Commission's proposal to reform the fruit and vegetables regime. On the latter, my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food welcomed the proposed steps towards reducing the role of intervention and urged the Council to commit itself to eventual abolition of intervention in this sector. He stressed the importance of focusing support on a wider range of organisations than the narrowly defined traditional producer co-operatives proposed by the Commission.
<P>

<a name="51103w01_para13"></a>Under other business, my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food expressed concern about the Commission's decision to reduce malt export refunds and effectively shorten the period for which export certificates were valid. Several other Ministers supported. The Commissioner undertook to reflect and if necessary adjust the measures in the light of experience.
<P>

<a name="51103w01_para14"></a>My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also pressed the Commission to retain provision for guaranteed set-aside, so that the important environmental benefits of these arrangements could be preserved. He argued that any proposal setting limits of nitrate in lettuce must reflect the scientific advice. He drew attention to the lack of any health risk to UK consumers, the need to promote consumption of vegetables and the devastating effect which unduly restrictive rules would have on the UK glasshouse industry. He therefore argued that there was no justification for the setting of such limits.
