<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Chalfont </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What guidance is given to universities on the criteria to be applied in selecting candidates for admission.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, universities are responsible for their own admissions policies. We believe that admission should be on the basis of merit. Universities are already exploring different ways in which to select students who will succeed on a course. We have asked the Higher Education Funding Council, with other higher education organisations, to look at how best practice might be translated into a flexible framework to help to ensure fairness and consistency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Is she aware that someone whose son was recently rejected by a Cambridge college was told that the Education Secretary was advising the university that it should favour not only candidates who went to schools with poor academic records but also those whose parents are badly off and uneducated? Can the Minister say whether that reflects Her Majesty's Government's policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State does not give advice to individual universities. It is for universities to determine their own admissions policies. In the White Paper, we have put forward proposals to look at the benchmarking exercise run by HEFCE which enables universities to examine how they recruit students of high merit from different backgrounds. I refer the noble Lord to that report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that the Secretary of State did not give directions to individual universities. But the Question concerned whether a general direction had been given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as I said, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State does not give general direction. As noble Lords are aware, in the White Paper we looked at how benchmarking is carried out with HEFCE. We also considered the separate issue of introducing a regulator for universities which choose to increase their fees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, given that at present universities select according to A-level grades, can the <P>


<a name="column_1120"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister tell the House what information her department has and how far that is a predictor for success in courses at university?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, some interesting research is currently taking place. Noble Lords may be aware of comments by Mike Tomlinson over the past couple of days about the use of e-portfolios. There is no question but that we want to ensure that students who arrive at university obtain the greatest benefit from that education. We recognise the fundamental importance of A-level grades within that. However, as HEFCE has done, we have also been examining research which demonstrates how university applicants who do not have the highest grades have proved themselves, within the context of their education, to be extremely good candidates. Although it is in its early stages, there is some evidence that those students can do better at university. I believe that for some time a number of universities have been trying to ensure that they follow good practice in finding the best candidates who will prove to be the best graduates. I believe that we can support that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that British universities have not only been looking at A-levels as markers but at the baccalaureate as well?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as I said, universities look at a range of different ways of assessing the best possible students. I do not have information on which universities may be considering the baccalaureate, although I suspect that some will do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, how are young students to make sense of the answer that the Minister gave to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock? How are they to understand what, other than their A-level grades, is to be taken into account? What can young people be advised to do in order to access university? Why should background matter at all when, as the noble Baroness said in her first Answer, access should be on merit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that we shall debate these issues at greater length than we can do within the Question. I am clear that the Government believe that students should be admitted to university on the basis of merit and that those who access such education should do the best that they can and be the best graduates. Over the years, universities have been concerned that applications should come from young people who are able to access that education; in other words, they want schools to work closely with them so that students apply to the best universities. They also want schools to ensure that young people realise that a university education is for them.
<P>

<a name="30129-01_para0"></a>It is crucial that students are accepted on merit. Sixty-eight per cent of students who arrive at university with three grade As at A-level are from the <P>


<a name="column_1121"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>state sector. Some universities will take perhaps 50 per cent of those; others will take a higher figure. Universities ask whether that is because some students do not apply to those universities or whether it is for other reasons. All universities want to ensure that they get the best students that they can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that many of our state schools could do more to raise the aspirations of their best students? Does she also agree that one problem that older universities, in particular, have is that a dearth of applicants come forward for the places? I do not know whether my noble friend saw the article in a popular newspaper last week written by Sir Colin Lucas, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. He described the process that Oxford has gone through in trying to attract fresh applicants. As a result of that, the number of students from state schools has increased by 30 per cent over the past three years. Is that not the way that we should be going?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the work carried out by Sir Colin Lucas is important, as was his article. As I have said before, the 14 to 19 strategy is important. If schools do not assist their young people to aspire to go to university, those young people will find it much more difficult to recognise the value and importance of a university education, especially if they do not have the role model of relatives or friends who have attended university. Universities can play a fundamental part in working with such schools. I pay tribute to Oxford University for the work that it does.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say precisely how the access regulator will go about his or her business in monitoring the admissions process in relation to all kinds of background data?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, consultation will take place in regard to the access regulator. In the coming months my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will issue a consultation paper that will enable debate to take place on the access regulator. When a university wishes to increase its fees, the access regulator will look at the admissions procedures of the university, at the best practice that exists, at what the university does to provide bursaries and other support and at the support that it provides to schools across the country to help them to prepare students for university life. We should recognise the value of that to students.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the social despair among those who were the first from their families to go to university, who enjoyed and benefited from the experience and who now fear that their children will be deprived of such a chance simply on the grounds that their parents benefited from a university education? That seems to them, and to me, to be a curious way of selecting candidates.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, there is nothing in our proposals that says that we would wish <P>


<a name="column_1122"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to see a good candidate for university fail to get in. This issue is not about social engineering in any way, shape or form, despite what the media may say. I am sure that noble Lords who have carefully considered our report will recognise that. We shall debate it at length. In this country we have good candidates who do not go to university. We want a well-educated society in which everyone who is capable of enjoying a university education benefits from it.

<P>
<UL>What progress is being made on the establishment of a Select Committee of the House to report on the policy considerations of statutory instruments.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, the Liaison Committee is responsible for considering proposals for new committees and for making recommendations to the House. When approving the fifth report of the Procedure Committee the House invited the Liaison Committee to give the idea of a new committee "early and sympathetic consideration". I understand that the Liaison Committee is due to meet on the 17th February to consider that proposal.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. Is he aware that this excellent proposal, which first surfaced at the end of the last century, has been going through the processes of Parliament with the speed that would make a snail look somewhat like a racing car? Furthermore, given that this House is complementary to another place, but also autonomous, and given that we had radio broadcasting and television broadcasting of our proceedings before another place and that we have set up our Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee which has no equivalent in another place, can the Minister explain why we should not act on our own?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to accept responsibility for most things, but not for the past 100 years, although sometimes it feels like it! This has nothing to do with the House of Commons. I have notified another place as a matter of courtesy. The President of the Council, my right honourable friend Mr Cook, said that he is looking, with interest, to see the experience that we are able to offer in our own committee. It would be a Lords committee, not a Joint Committee. I repeat, I hope without impoliteness, that the matter has nothing to do with the House of Commons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend accept that the case for policy consideration appears to be serious? I illustrate that by saying that when the Joint Committee considered an order requiring taxi cabs to display notices saying that <P>


<a name="column_1123"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guide dogs were permitted, Parliament was in fact requiring that the dogs should read the notice. However, I was out of order in making the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we have agreed that the committee will draw attention to those instruments that merit further debate or consideration. That appears to be an ample rubric.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boston of Faversham: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord realise that he does not need to accept responsibility for what happened more than 100 years ago because the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said "at the end of the last century", which was only a couple of years ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am so sorry. I misunderstood what the noble Lord said. Time goes very quickly when one is having fun.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, the reason for setting up such a committee, which I believe is desirable, is that over the past few years we have seen a massive increase in the amount of delegated legislation going through both Houses and increasingly an unwillingness of Ministers to put down details of legislation on the face of primary legislation. What is the noble and learned Lord doing, in his position in the Cabinet, to use all of his powers of persuasion, which are legion, in order to discourage the practice of increased secondary legislation coming through Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, we need to approach this problem in at least two ways. First, we need to look at pre-legislative scrutiny, which your Lordships have warmly applauded and on which we are now starting to deliver. Secondly, we need a committee of experience and expertise to draw attention to instruments that merit further debate. I look forward to the experience that we can derive from the work of the committee which can perhaps be offered to the Commons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches welcome the proposed committee and believe that it would be an effective instrument to deal with people's concern about regulation and secondary legislation being used in place of primary legislation. We hope that another place will listen to the experience of this House on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that generous observation. During the next year or two, we may consider whether we can improve our procedures. If so, I am sure that lessons will be learnt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, if the Select Committee is to consider those instruments that require particular attention, does that not imply that a large number of <P>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>instruments are not contentious and could be dealt with separately&#151;perhaps off the Floor of the House, in a Grand Committee of some form?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that that is right. For example, I think that we all remember the shellfish orders with consuming passion. My noble friend, named as Peer of the Year&#151;which was extremely well deserved&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew12"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, what my noble friend said echoed what the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, suggested the other day, which was that we might take some orders off the Floor of the House&#151;the noble Lord suggested the Moses Room. That appears to me to be a useful step for the Liaison Committee to consider.

<P>
<UL>What arrangements they have in mind to improve methods for setting the pay of British firefighters.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the Government are committed to modernising the Fire Service along the lines of Sir George Bain's independent review. We intend to restore a power for the Government to direct pay and conditions in the Fire Service. That means that we shall be able to impose a settlement if it proves necessary to do so. We hope that it will not. The Government will respond in full to the Bain review in a White Paper later this year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. As we have all done, I studied carefully the Statement made yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott. I welcome Mr Prescott's Pauline conversion. Although it has taken a long time, his decision to seek emergency powers to settle the pay for the Fire Brigades Union is right.
<P>

<a name="30129-02_para0"></a>However, will not the legislative process take at least some weeks? Given that the Armed Forces are now stretched to the limit, would it not be sensible, if a negotiated settlement has not been reached within a week or two, to consider seeking a court injunction for emergency powers to stop the strike?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the issue of court injunctions is entirely a matter for the Attorney-General. It must be right that he gives that matter independent consideration. We welcome the noble Lord's support for the measures announced yesterday. Although it is true that they will take some weeks to introduce, we intend to ensure that they are in place in <P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>weeks rather than months, so that they can have some bearing on the outcome of this most unfortunate and regrettable dispute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will know that the employers supported the Deputy Prime Minister's Statement yesterday. That is not surprising, given that the negotiation has been tripartite and confusing. Is the Minister aware that the Bain review recommends,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "that the Local Government Association . . . take steps to develop the contribution of elected members on fire authorities and to ensure that they give stronger leadership in the future"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-02_para1"></a>
Does not the Deputy Prime Minister's Statement indicate a centralising approach? How does it square with Sir George Bain's recommendation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, there might be some merit in what the noble Baroness said if it were not that Sir Jeremy Beecham, who is after all the chairman of the Local Government Association, gave the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement yesterday his fulsome support. That speaks volumes about where the employers are: they are at one with the Government in seeking to resolve matters and entirely agree with the steps that the Government announced yesterday.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Lawson of Blaby: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are fully committed to a solution along the lines of the Bain report, would they not be well advised to suggest to the local authority employers that they give notice that if there are any further strikes, all the striking firemen will be dismissed and offered immediate re-employment individually on Bain terms, and that any subsequent vacancies will be filled by recruitment? After all, President Reagan did something similar more than 20 years ago with the air traffic controllers in the United States and it worked extremely successfully.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, that is an interesting notion, but I doubt that it bears much relation to the reality of the situation. Obviously we must protect fundamental rights; the right to withdraw labour is one of those rights. On the other hand, we have a duty to ensure that public safety is paramount and protected. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday announced what I consider to be a balanced and measured set of proposals to try to bring a conclusion to this unfortunate and regrettable dispute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is a long history of politicians and governments getting involved in trade union negotiations? Although the Government must pick up the tab, trade union negotiations are best conducted between employers and employees, who must live with each other at the end of the day.

<A NAME="30129-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, that is what the Deputy Prime Minister has been seeking to encourage <P>


<a name="column_1126"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>during the past few months. He has prosecuted his case extremely well. It is absolutely right that employers and unions must sit round a table to hammer things out. The measures announced yesterday are an encouragement to that process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend not take too much notice of advice from those on the Opposition Benches on dealing with trade union matters? I served for many hours with the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, during the passage of the Trade Union Act 1984. His claim to fame then was as chairman of the Association of Conservative Trade Unionists. I suggest that my noble friend takes more notice of the point made yesterday by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about the official solicitor. Many of us know what happens when governments try to impose conditions on striking workers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks volumes about how we ought to try to proceed in these matters: with care and caution to ensure that the unions and employers work together to conclude effective collective solutions. That is the best way forward; that is what we are trying to encourage; the Deputy Prime Minister wants matters to proceed in that manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, is there really a sense of urgency in trying to sort this lot out? The Deputy Prime Minister's Statement yesterday gave one the feeling that action was being taken, but in his Answer the Minister said that a White Paper considering the Bain proposals would be issued later this year. The Bain proposals have been published for weeks now. Why have the Government not yet done something about them? There must be squads of people who could conduct the analysis and prepare a White Paper, which would make it much easier to set the pay of British firefighters in future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is right that we try to hasten the conclusion of the discussions to resolve the pay dispute. The modernisation package is a longer-term issue and the proposals that will no doubt be made in the White Paper must take into account the finer detail of what was, after all, a comprehensive report. I have no doubt that that will happen, but we must concentrate our efforts on settling the pay dispute. As part of that, Bain, modernisation and the White Paper will be part of a whole package.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister noted the reservations expressed by the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>general secretary elect of the Trades Union Congress, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union and the general secretary of Unison?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I understand that there are regular liaison meetings about all those issues. No doubt they will have a bearing on the outcome. Of course we take careful note of what is said in public debate on the matter, but the Government remain resolute in seeking to ensure a proper solution to the fire dispute. We urge the FBU to get round the table with the employers, return to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and ensure that proper negotiations are conducted so that this unfortunate dispute can be drawn to a conclusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that time is of the essence and that if disruption continues the Government will have no option but to bring forward emergency legislation? If not, does the noble Lord agree that arbitration independent of the Government would be a far more acceptable means of resolution than any imposed by decree of the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have an adequate arbitration system through ACAS and the Government are happy to rely on that. It has worked effectively for many years. It certainly worked effectively when the party of which the noble Lord is a member was in government. We shall rely on that process and hope that the FBU and the employers will use it to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the current dispute.

This will require a unanimous decision by all 15 EU member states. The matter was discussed at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels on 27th January, but this proved inconclusive. Further discussions are due to take place tomorrow, 30th January.

<FONT SIZE=3>Mugabe as I wish to discuss a more important question&#151;that is, the renewal of sanctions. Is the Minister aware that the sanctions imposed by New Zealand on Zimbabwe and Mr Mugabe apply to considerably more people than there are on the European Union list? They apply not only to members of Mr Mugabe's party but to his business supporters. Will the Minister arrange to instruct the United Kingdom representative at tomorrow's meeting to propose that sanctions should be extended to some of the financial backers of Mr Mugabe who were named in the report approved by the United Nations Security Council only last Friday&#151;including, for example, Mr John Bredenkamp and his family? Mr Bredenkamp was deeply involved in plundering the Congo in collaboration with Mr Mugabe and is one of his principal financial supporters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, that our instructions to our permanent representative, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, who will be at tomorrow's meeting, will be to press for the most robust package of sanctions and the longest period of roll-over it is possible to negotiate. However, I stress that we must proceed on the basis of a unanimous agreement. The noble Lord will be aware that this matter will be pursued under the common foreign and security policy. That means that all countries will have a veto&#151;and that can sometimes cut two ways.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister draw the attention of our European Union partners&#151;the French, in particular&#151;to the Inter-Parliamentary Union council resolution of 27th September 2002 in which serious allegations were made about the torture of six opposition Members of Parliament? Will she also draw the attention of our partners to the demand made by Mr Morgan Tsvangirai for a judicial investigation into the torture of another MP, Mr Job Sikhala? In view of these allegations, does not the Minister consider that any members of the regime who set foot on European soil should be interviewed with a view to their prosecution under the relevant legislation giving effect to the Convention Against Torture, which has been signed by all European states?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I assure the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that Her Majesty's Government brings all these matters to the attention of our partners in the European Union and many are supportive of our stance. The noble Lord cited the IPU report of 27th September. I would cite the statement of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 14th January this year. There is ample evidence of the terrible effect that the Mugabe regime is having on a country which was once the breadbasket of the region but which is now riddled with famine and difficulties of the kind described by the noble Lord. We lose no opportunity to make this clear to our partners, and we very much hope that they will listen.

<a name="column_1129"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord the Attorney-General enunciated the principle that heads of state while serving were immune from criminal jurisdiction? Does or does not that apply to those who have been heads of legitimate governments which are now regarded by Her Majesty's Government as illegitimate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord comes to the heart of the question. There is no problem with the roll-over of most of the sanctions&#151;the arms embargo, the assets freeze and a number of other matters&#151; but there is an issue in regard to the travel ban. As they do every other year, the French wish to hold a summit meeting and to invite the heads of state of all the African countries to meet them in Paris. That meeting is due to take place in a period shortly after the sanctions end. The idea the French are pursuing is that there should be a window of opportunity to allow them to do that. There would therefore be a gap in the travel ban of some three to four days. Her Majesty's Government are disappointed that the French take that view.

<P>

<A NAME="30129-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, in regard to the answer given to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, about the prosecution of heads of state who have left power, did not the House make a declaration on a similar matter when it decided that General Pinochet could be prosecuted? Indeed, he was placed under house arrest in this country. Is that not the case? Am I wrong?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, yes. That is why I answered the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in the way that I did.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, the Ministry of Defence makes provision under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and the equivalent reserves scheme for personnel injured or killed in service. Those wanting additional protection can obtain cover from commercial providers through independent financial advisers or insurance brokers. The MoD also facilitates voluntary, commercially-run schemes&#151;PAX, Forces Safeguard and RPAX&#151;for all personnel. These are still available at present. Nevertheless, the Government are currently examining the options should the necessary cover become unavailable at a reasonable premium.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. I declare an interest as an honorary vice-president of the Royal British Legion women's section. Is the Minister aware of the great anxiety this is causing? People who are willing to risk their lives are concerned that those they leave behind may suddenly find themselves homeless because mortgages cannot be met. All kinds of other financial difficulties could arise. As I understand it, the pension scheme to which the Minister refers will give only the equivalent of one year's earnings, whereas many private companies schemes give four times that. Is he also aware that, contrary to what he has said about the Safeguard scheme, I am told that it is not available at present and that it has never covered reservists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the RPAX scheme, which has been in operation for some time, covers reservists. Of course there are concerns about this, and the Government want to do their best to alleviate those concerns. That is why I want to make it clear that personnel who are already insured under the Forces Safeguard and the RPAX schemes, as well as being insured under ordinary commercial schemes, will be covered. That is the crucial message that we need to get across this afternoon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the recent letter in The Times from a consultant surgeon who is also a reservist, worrying about the fact that there is no cover, from his point of view? Is the Minister worried that there will be a shortage of medical personnel if it is true that they will not be covered without a limit of finality on their service abroad?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the letter that appeared in The Times yesterday. I have already accepted that there is concern about the issue. I can only repeat that the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and the equivalent reserves scheme are available and that those wanting additional protection can still get it from commercial providers. Those who already have additional protection are covered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, will there be an increase in the death-in-service benefit from one and a half times to four times, and when could we expect such provision to be made? If there is an excess premium for <P>


<a name="column_1131"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reservists who are caught out if they are called up unexpectedly, will the Government meet those excess premiums?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, on the first part of the noble Lord's question, it is a little too simple to suggest that the death-in-service benefit under the existing Armed Forces Pension Scheme is as limited as the noble Lord suggests. There is a one-off lump sum payment with a subsequent pension. For death on active service, both are tax free and are calculated according to factors such as number of dependants and length of service. We are looking at how we can improve this package, but it will take some time before we can complete our consideration and do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, what guidance is given on life and disability insurance matters when reservists report to mobilisation centres? What guidance is given to regular personnel when enlisting into the Armed Forces? Will the Minister comment on the fact that, as I understand it, Safeguard has said that it is excluding war cover with effect from 7th February?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, as far as Safeguard is concerned, I believe that a meeting is to be held tomorrow to see whether what appeared in The Times yesterday will happen. The noble Lord asks what we do to inform personnel, especially reservists, about insurance matters when they join up. Some providers&#151;and I think this is the basis of his question&#151;have withdrawn schemes for new members under order to deploy. Existing policyholders are on unchanged risk until their policy expires. Internal communications briefings steer individuals to the services' insurance and investment advisory panel. We assist service personnel in getting independent financial advice by publishing a list of 35 independent financial advisers and brokers who have knowledge of the services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that on the death of any reservist in this conflict, which we hope will not be, his widow would count as a war widow?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I can confirm that because, as I said in answer to the original Question, the equivalent attributable reserves scheme&#151;the equivalent of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, which the noble Baroness, Lady Strange, knows very well&#151;will apply for personnel injured or killed in service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-04_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in another place, the Secretary of State for Defence said that these insurance companies were still offering cover, whereas the Minister seems to have admitted today that a number of well known insurers are not? Is not the great dividing line between those who already have policies, whom we know are covered, and those who are now applying? Is he willing to admit that people are being refused policies now?

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Freyberg </B>   rose to call attention to the role of design in improving public services; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the aim of this debate is to look at the way design is used in the public sector and to examine its potential to create a lasting <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>impact, both financially and practically. I should like to speak about the design of goods and services in the public sector and about the systems needed to deliver them. Coupled together, these can offer the tools to transform our public services and provide ways of saving money in the long term.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para1"></a>Every year, central and local government spend billions of pounds on the design of goods and services in the public sector, from building hospitals to providing furniture for schools, new housing, street lighting, prisons, transport, waste disposal, and so on. However, there is evidence that the standard of design in these areas is still far from impressive, and new initiatives to improve it seem to be making very little impact.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para2"></a> On the face of it, the solution seems to be simple: first, to make greater use of the best design talent available; and, secondly, to realise that proper investment in good design at the outset will save money and improve lives in the long term&#151;that is, long-term value over short-term expediency. However, at present, a host of good intentions and theoretical practical measures, such as the insistence that design principles be applied, have been set out in numerous government reports and ministerial speeches, but these are not in any way matched by results. What can the Government do that they are not doing already?
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para3"></a>Discussion with those in the design world and at the Design Council in particular, of which I am a member (along with co-chair of the Associated Parliamentary Group for Design & Innovation), has led me to conclude that there would be considerable benefits in the public sector reassessing its design practices; that is, the point at which the design of products and processes is considered. In other words, what needs to change is the very culture responsible for procuring new buildings and services.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para4"></a>I would therefore like to alert the Government and those responsible for public sector spending to ways of thinking about and applying design principles that are most likely to produce good results. Over the past few years, the case for good design in government and public services has been keenly fought and, by and large, accepted. However, this message does not seem to be getting through to those who are actually responsible for commissioning and managing public buildings and services. For example, the recent Audit Commission report, which looks at schools built by private finance initiative (PFI) and those funded by traditional public finance, shows that the quality of all buildings was unsatisfactory. The faults referred to are fundamental ones; for instance, the quality of the building, layout, lights, classroom size, heating and acoustics as well as an absence of design innovation. This is a terrific waste of opportunity.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para5"></a>This and other evidence that I could point to suggests that despite many initiatives the overall standard of design in building schools has not improved. A similar picture holds for recurrent spending on product design. The Department for Education and Skills spent £1 billion a year&#151;13 per <P>


<a name="column_1134"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cent of total expenditure&#151;on learning tools and resources. Yet currently few of Britain's best designers are involved and purchasing decisions are not linked to the broader understanding of desired educational outcomes.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para6"></a>There is clear evidence that while those taking decisions to acquire new services often recognise the importance of good design, they lack the expertise or contacts. Last year, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) discovered that only 23 per cent of local authorities make use of design expertise when assessing planning or investment applications. Schemes which teach design awareness to the decision-makers and local authorities are crucial if we want to raise the standards and quality of our public services. That applies also to government and their departments.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para7"></a>The question today is how we use design to achieve practical and worthwhile changes in our public services, turning aspirational government policy into real beneficial and long-lasting improvements for the use of those services.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para8"></a>The connection to design in this context might not seem obvious, but design, of course, is not just about objects and the aesthetics of form. It is my belief that well designed systems for delivering public services are a crucial part of providing these desired improvements. Design considerations should be brought into play at the earliest possible opportunity&#151;technical systems and organisational structures need themselves to be well designed.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para9"></a> I am not advocating endless surveys into the requirements for each public service. Instead, targeted consultation at the point of use should be carried out by people who understand the function of design as a tool to deliver public services. The design industry has developed a range of fast and effective techniques&#151;borrowed from the social sciences&#151;to understand and interpret the needs of users. Those techniques are simple to apply and go beyond focus groups or market research in what they can deliver.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para10"></a>The Government can encourage the learning process: more specifically, their various departments must be prepared to engage in dialogue with each other and with frontline agencies if more than one is involved in a particular scheme. These user-focused techniques developed by the design industry can encourage cross-departmental thinking and provide easy-to-use tools for the new practice.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para11"></a>Nor should we shy away from addressing first principles where necessary. Many of our public service institutions are still built to Victorian models and need to be radically rethought. The Do Tank's report on the 21st century prison looks at the problem of sprawling gaols built in the 19th century and is concerned that many of our new ones are simply modern and outdated versions of the originals. It proposes smaller "learning prisons", specifically designed to enable resources to be switched from security to rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para12"></a>Integral to the project is not only a building design, but the design of a new learning regime&#151;again, developed by working with prisoners and prison <P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>officers. I am no expert on penal reform, but I can and do applaud the report's attempt to use design in such a practical and radical way.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para13"></a>There is clear evidence of the all-round benefits when the design is right. A King's Fund document published in 2002 highlighted the example of Newham Hospital in south-east London where levels of staff morale increased by 56 per cent following the redesign of the hospital. When asked whether they felt valued, 78 per cent of staff said, "Yes", after the redesign compared to 22 per cent three years previously. In other words, when one makes an investment in high-quality fabric and environment, one is making an investment in the people who work and pass through it as well. There is no short cut to that.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para14"></a>Up until now, the effective use of design within public services has lagged behind industry where the benefits have already been clearly demonstrated, a fact which has been borne out repeatedly by Design Council research. There have been a few notable exceptions, such as the redesign of the Royal Mail's change of address service. As a result, the public's completion of forms was transformed from 87 per cent incorrect to 90 per cent correct and entirely eliminated the need for staff training.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para15"></a>An example of good practice in the education field can be seen in the work of the government-funded charity, School Works, which links the design of secondary school buildings to the educational agenda&#151;a rare occurrence. At Kingsdale in south London&#151;a school classed as failing at the start of the project&#151;a new curriculum, management structure and pastoral care system were designed along with a new building.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para16"></a>The momentum created by the whole process led to a renewed belief in the school's future. Pupils gaining GCSE grades A to C increased 20 per cent in the first academic year. In a recent report for the Department for Education and Skills, PricewaterhouseCoopers documented the strategic use of a design process in turning the school around. However, it should be emphasised that such practice is at present the exception rather than the norm.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para17"></a>The School Works scheme aims to provide practical solutions by combining expert knowledge with the expertise of those who work and live in the educational institution. Such an approach may sound like common sense, but it is an advance on the way design solutions have been achieved in the past, when they were often imposed without full consultation with those who would be using them.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para18"></a>Another problem is that many of the best smaller design companies are put off applying for the public sector design contracts by the long-winded bureaucratic hoops that they have to jump through. Public accountability is important, but it should be recognised that there is a downside. Where possible, we need to speed up the system and harness all the creative talents that we can.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para19"></a>This is of pressing importance because the Government have embarked on the most ambitious programme of public spending investment and reform <P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>since the 1940s. To give an example of the scale, in 2003&#150;04, £24 billion will be spent on public services in addition to what is already invested and in 2004&#150;05 that will increase to £40 billion.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para20"></a>I was recently introduced to the term "smart spending", which I suggest is an apt one for the use of design in public services. Investment in good design is a form of smart spending: it need not cost more and it can save money in the medium to long term. Improving the quality of design also offers the potential to improve the outcome of the services offered.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para21"></a> Finally, I would like to encourage all government departments to see design as important and relevant to them and not just the preserve of the DTI. Design of effective systems as well as of goods and services can bring lasting benefits to the users of those services and can save money in the long term. More importantly, we need to ensure that the people at the forefront of delivering those services, of building or managing them, know the benefits of using good design solutions because without their participation all of those good intentions will be wasted.

The power of design in reshaping the underlying systems and businesses process is very important. Without a doubt, high quality public services are vital to the nation's prosperity and well-being.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para23"></a>Britain is rightly regarded as a world leader in design. Successful businesses are the ones that invest in design to create more innovative and valued products and services, but in the public services that is not the case, and we must ask why.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para24"></a>The Government clearly recognise the importance of high quality public services to the nation's prosperity. Much effort is being put into modernising our public services, and the Government have embarked upon the most ambitious programme of investment in public services for more than 50 years. By 2004, public spending on education alone will buy one-third more than in 1997 terms. Modernisation requires investment, which is something that our public services were starved of in the 1980s and 1990s and&#151;to be honest&#151;well before that. That amounts to years of neglect, and it will take a long time before that can be turned round.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para25"></a>Money alone, however, will not deliver the reform of public services, or the transformation necessary. We all know that some of the worst public services have been among the most costly. People who work in public services systems do not go to work because they want to do a bad job&#151;quite the reverse. Often they work in systems and structures that inevitably deliver poor outcomes. How frustrating and demotivating it <P>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>must be for workers to work in a system capable only of delivering poor outcomes, however good they are as individuals.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para26"></a>For the Government's investment to deliver improvements, we must take a completely fresh look at the systems and structures that underpin the delivery of those services. We need to break out of the traditional ways of doing things, which will only continue to deliver the same outcomes and ultimately fail the needs of the people who depend on those services. Design skills and design thinking have a central role to play in transforming our public services. Design offers creative innovation and a new perspective on persistent problems. If public services are to be valued by the public, they must be redesigned around the needs of the users&#151;the pupils, parents, patients and passengers.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para27"></a>The traditional model of a public service can be caricatured as being provider led, inward looking and hidebound by rules and structures and hierarchy. We need to break out from that model; services need to be redesigned so that the user is at the centre of everything that is done. Targets, inspection and league tables all have a part to play in increasing the accountability of public services, but over-inspection and the imposition of arbitrary targets can actually stifle creativity and innovation.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para28"></a>Fundamentally, improvement comes from within public organisations, and is not something that is done to it from outside. The people who work in the systems and processes will be those who deliver that improvement. We need to build the capacity of our public services to transform themselves and to achieve improvement continually. We need to give those who work in public services the right tools and techniques to redesign systems and structures to deliver high quality services for their customers.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para29"></a> I have some good examples from public services in my area. For example, local pension officers from the Department for Work and Pensions work alongside local council officers to provide a one-stop-shop for pensioners to improve ease of access and take up of benefits and pensions. That is so important when at least a quarter of pensioners do not take up their benefit entitlement.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para30"></a>I can also cite a successful partnership between police and local councils delivering enterprising solutions for designing out crime from local neighbourhoods, such an "alley gating" schemes. That involves the gating off of common alleyways in terraced housing areas, reclaiming the space for local people and cutting burglary by one-fifth compared with other areas.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para31"></a>My local council in Tameside, with its staff, recently redesigned the way in which they process council tax benefit claims. By involving the staff, applying the tools and techniques of design and taking a completely fresh and unfettered look at the services, they reduced the error rate from 80 per cent&#151;the sector's norm&#151;to less than 1 per cent. They also reduced the time taken to process claims from 10 days to one and, at the same time, slashed unit costs.

<P>

<a name="30129-05_para32"></a> Finally, we must not have the idea that redesigning services is a one-off process. It cannot be seen that way. The search for improvement in public services must be never ending. The use of design as a critical tool must be an integral process.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wakeham: </B>   My Lords, I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, for initiating this debate, as it is an important subject.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para33"></a>I was the Minister responsible for the Design Council about 20 years ago, and I remember those days well. The situation then was that good design was always spoken of as important but never given enough importance in practice. It was somewhat similar to a publishing and purchasing policy for which I also had some responsibility around that time. As an ex-Treasury Minister, I accept that some of the blame remained with the Treasury, but that is not the whole story.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para34"></a>We produce many of the best designers in the world, but at that time far too many of them went overseas to work. The constant complaint to me from leading designers was that too many of the top people had financial skills but knew absolutely nothing about design. There was a lot of truth in that accusation, but in my view the fault is not on both sides. Part of my purpose today is to hear from the Minister how we have moved on in the past 20 years.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para35"></a> For every business manager who knew nothing about design, there was a designer who knew nothing about finance. They simply did not speak the same language. A key of good design is that it is sometimes wise not to accept the lowest price on offer. Many times the lowest price is the right choice, but the cheapest is not always the best. Taking something well designed or building up a long-term relationship with a supplier may be more expensive in the short run but cheaper in the long run. Those who know about design need to persuade those who make decisions to take a wider view.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para36"></a>I detect that we may have made some progress over the past 20 years and we still have a long way to go, but the Design Council can take a lot of credit. However, that organisation's website shows that too much of its material is designed to appeal to those who are already converted and accept the basic concepts of good design. That is important for the Design Council, which must remain at the forefront of progress, but there is another more basic job to do. The Design Council must get across to a large majority of the slightly cynical mass of managers that good design is a vital part of any investment appraisal.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para37"></a>Put simply, we need good designers but we also need financial managers who are better aware of the importance of good design. My experience taught me that one cannot take everything that they say at face value. In my day there were, and I suspect there still are, too many managers who publicly called for design and were strong advocates of it but who did not in practice, when making decisions, live up to their word.

<P>

<a name="30129-05_para38"></a>I have not come to this debate to criticise or to complain but to find out how, in this important area, the messages that I was trying to get across 20 years ago have made progress. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I greatly enjoyed the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, in both its spirit and substance. I wait with keen anticipation what the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank, will say in his maiden speech. He is a shining star of architecture world-wide. We look forward to his speech.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para39"></a>Almost 50 years ago I walked into the newly-opened Design Centre in Haymarket and it was a revelation. It was an outcome of the Festival of Britain. I was greatly impressed by the products on show. My wife and I were newly-married and we looked for our essential domestic utensils. We bought them from the shops when they were available. We still have some of those cups, saucers, knives and forks that we saw in the Design Centre.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para40"></a>As names are so easily forgotten, I pay tribute to Gordon Russell and Paul Reilly who brought energy and flair to the Council of Industrial Design and to the nation. It made a permanent impact on those times. Together with the Consumers' Association and Which? magazine, they led a consumer revolution in what was becoming an affluent society. At least, that was my lay view because I had not been involved in design or manufacturing.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para41"></a>Then, almost 20 years ago, the voters of Stockton-on-Tees lost their enthusiasm for me and, in due course, in 1987 I became director-general of the Royal Institute of British Architects. So for the first time I began to reflect on the design of buildings, including buildings serving the public.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para42"></a>As a Minister I had not thought much about the role of architecture in the public estate. I was involved in the planning of a new headquarters building for the Ministry of Defence, including its location, its cost and the transfer of staff, but I never raised the question of design, nor did my civil servants offer any such advice.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para43"></a>Good public sector clients usually appointed good architects and good architects achieved good public architecture. But new, countervailing factors in the late 1980s and early 1990s began to damage the role of high quality design. The first was the growth of design and build (usually a misnomer) and, secondly, compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). The aim was to reduce costs by diminishing the primary role of the architect as designer, thus putting price before value. Later, a third factor emerged with the arrival of the private finance initiative (PFI) which would further diminish the role of the architect.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para44"></a>Then, rather to my surprise, soon after 1997 the new government decided that design could lead to better public buildings. With the Prime Minister's personal support, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment was set up and Sir Stuart Lipton, a hard-headed property developer, was appointed. <P>


<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Despite some scepticism and little initial enthusiasm on the part of most Whitehall departments, it has since vigorously campaigned for high quality design. Already CABE has helped to change the mood of all those deeply concerned about the environment.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para45"></a>That is all good news but I have three principal concerns. First, it is probable that the PFI will diminish the design factor in the complicated equation of construction. As the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, mentioned, the recent Audit Commission report has said that early PFI schools are not significantly better. All the pressures, including the Government's own PFI ideology, point the wrong way.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para46"></a>Secondly, despite good intentions, guidance on improving standards of design in the procurement of public buildings falls short of instructions. I hope that operational guidance on the procurement of public buildings will be acted upon and that performance will be monitored.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para47"></a>Thirdly&#151;this is wholly relevant to this very welcome debate&#151;I hope that CABE and the architectural dimension in the public sector will be cross-party. It is right for the Government to claim credit for these developments. I welcome the Prime Minister's award for better public buildings. But if we are to have better public buildings from one generation to another, there must be a sustained campaign that will endure from one government to another.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to take part in a debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, who, as most of us know, is a skilled practitioner in sculpture. Sculpture is to my mind one of the most attractive and satisfying of the visual arts because of its three dimensional aspect.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para48"></a>I believe that design, whether it be design of objects or furniture or design of the internal and external layout of buildings of all kinds, or, indeed, the design of whole districts and cities, can enhance immeasurably our ability to work and function effectively and, indeed, the whole environment in which we live. To my mind, good design is not just a joy in itself.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para49"></a>Design is as old as civilisation itself. In creating today's public buildings and their layout and content, I believe that design is as vital to the purposes and functions of those buildings as it was in the creation of a Greek temple or a Roman palazzo. The Design Council, of which the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, is a distinguished member, has published a useful briefing paper for this debate. Reference has already been made, both by the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and by my noble friend Lord Pendry, to the neatly alliterative phrase of the Prime Minister when he referred to the importance of design in satisfying users whether they be patients, parents, pupils or passengers. I believe that he also referred to victims of crime. I should like to mention passengers and victims of crime.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para50"></a>Foreign visitors to London comment frequently most favourably on the design of our taxis and, indeed, of our buses. Not long ago I was about to take my wife <P>


<a name="column_1141"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>home after an orthopaedic operation and asked the hospital to order us a taxi, knowing that the back of a taxi is splendidly designed for ample luggage and, indeed, for putting one's legs straight out without having to bend them. We were somewhat dismayed when we realised that the hospital had an arrangement with a minicab firm. A small saloon arrived that was completely useless for the purposes in hand because of the small amount of room in the back.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para51"></a>The design of our buses has gradually been improved and adapted over the years, especially for driver-only operation, although they could do with further change to facilitate the carriage of disabled passengers. There is always a great outcry whenever that is mentioned because of the expense that might be involved. But sometimes it is important to put in order of preference comfort and convenience on the one hand and expense on the other. I think in particular of how the design of some of our train carriages has, far from improving, declined. I am, unfortunately for myself, a frequent traveller on Thames Trains. They have become typically poor in terms of design for luggage space, seating and lavatories. The Design Council states in its briefing paper:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Britain has a wealth of expertise in transport design".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para52"></a>
Indeed, but, sadly, good design aimed at comfort and convenience of passengers often seems forced into second place against the demands of economy.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para53"></a>Economy class seating in aircraft has been a subject of debate many times in this House and I need not worry your Lordships about it. Noble Lords will well know that for long-haul flights in particular the space between rows has been limited and reduced. I fear that it is not only a matter of inconvenience but also perhaps of risk to one's health. I believe that passengers are a good deal less impressed by those changes&#151;they are often referred to as design improvements&#151;in the liveries and logos of transport companies, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, once graphically demonstrated in relation to British Airways, than by changes that can be brought about to enhance comfort.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para54"></a>Because of the time factor, I shall not go into the matter of the victims of crime. I believe that noble Lords would agree in general terms that, whether it be the layout of council estates, referred to by my noble friend, or car parks, although a great deal has been done, even more could be done to ensure greater safety for the possible victims of thieves and drug dealers.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Foster of Thames Bank: </B>   My Lords, in rising for the first time in your Lordships' House, I am greatly indebted to my noble friend Lord Freyberg for initiating this vitally important debate on something which is so close to my heart.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para55"></a>A debate about design is, for me, a debate about values because I sincerely believe that there is a moral imperative for good design; to do it well and responsibly. Design is not an add-on, it is not a cosmetic, it is not window-dressing. It is a core, <P>


<a name="column_1142"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primary activity because anything in any part of the world that we inhabit has to be made. But before it is made it has to be designed. There are no exceptions whether it is on the scale of a city, the infrastructure of its buildings, the equipment in them, the infrastructure of streets and public spaces, pavements, the paving slabs, the door handles and even the invisible digital electronic world&#151;it all has to be designed. It is a human act because design is a response to the needs of people, whether they are spiritual or material. The quality of that design affects the quality of all of our lives. As Winston Churchill said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we shape our buildings and thereafter they shape us".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para56"></a>
He could be talking about infrastructure because the infrastructure of public services is arguably more important than any individual building.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para57"></a>There are many myths about good design or perhaps they are really excuses for bad design. One is that it costs more and that we cannot afford it. Believe me, quality is an attitude of mind. It is not how much one spends of precious resources; it is how wisely one spends them. Resources are money, obviously; time is a very precious resource, but above all, there is creative energy. That is the determining factor, which is more important than money.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para58"></a>Given the power of creative energy, as a nation we are fortunate to have an abundance of talent, which is sought after around the world. Perhaps the most important point of all is that the challenge is to harness that creative energy and bring it close to the decision-making process. Only in that way can we raise standards and genuinely encourage innovation.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para59"></a>Apart from the ability of good design to lift our spirits, to offer delight and pleasure, enlightened design delivers economic benefits. We know that in a hospital a room with a view reduces recovery time. We know that the workplace is a good and desirable place to go as it can provide a better lifestyle, which increases productivity. We know that an airport with views, natural light and sunlight makes travel less stressful but vitally it dramatically reduces energy consumption.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para60"></a>We know that our buildings can be powered by clean, renewable sources of energy. We are not dependent on depleting fossil fuels. The German Reichstag parliament is a working example of that philosophy. But design is not a static one-off event; it is evolutionary. As the components of our environment erode around us over time design initiatives are required to upgrade them and eventually, as they become obsolete, they are required to replace others with more adequate and up to date facilities. In that sense it is evolutionary.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para61"></a>Designers continually face new challenges, some caused by irresponsible past strategies, the threat of global warming and population growth. They affect the balance of an island nation as much as a mega-city on the Pacific Rim. The challenges are the same, only the scale varies.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para62"></a>I passionately believe that we have to build more densely in urban areas and&#151;a vital coupling&#151;when we do that we have to improve the standard of urban <P>


<a name="column_1143"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>living. It may mean building taller, but not always. It certainly means producing more housing of higher quality and at lower cost. I believe passionately that history is on the side of the density argument.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para63"></a>Buildings consume half the energy produced in an industrialised society; transport and industry, the infrastructure, the remainder. Given the link between energy production, pollution and global warming, the threat to the fragile planet's eco-system, there are strong arguments for reducing the energy demands in building and infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para64"></a>The quest for a greener, more ecologically responsible design is not about fashion, but about survival. Designers can advocate with passion, but in the end they are only as good as those who lead; those who have the courage and the political will to set standards and raise goals. In that spirit it has been a privilege to participate in this constructive and, I believe, far-reaching debate. I thank your Lordships for your kind attention in listening to me for the first time.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Chesterton: </B>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank, and to say how honoured we all are to have such a distinguished architect and designer in our midst. Although no one is predicting that we shall follow the Germans with a new parliamentary building as part of our reforms, we could be sure that the design would be in good hands with the noble Lords, Lord Foster, Lord Rogers of Riverside, and perhaps with the noble Lord, Lord Freyburg, contributing some modern sculpture.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para65"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foster, was educated at Burnage Grammar School, Manchester University School of Architecture and Yale University School of Architecture. His career has been in private practice. He has pioneered new structures, collaborating with Buckminster Fuller. Noble Lords will have seen the gherkin rising in the City and Stansted and will have some idea of their origins.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para66"></a>He has set up a world famous practice. His buildings have enlivened our cities and helped the United Kingdom to develop a more design conscious society. He has received many awards, prizes and fellowships from Europe and the United States, from academies and universities. As a professor at University College London I am pleased to say that he has been a visiting professor at Bartlett School of Architecture there. His books describe beautifully his marvellous buildings. He even has time for his recreations of flying, ski-ing and running.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para67"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, on initiating this debate on such an important topic. I also thank the Design Council, which has produced a useful package of information for it. My own experience in this area is that I ran a rather high profile government agency, the Meteorological Office, where we had many discussions on design and presentation. The chief executive's view was seldom listened to. That is because we listened to designers.
<P>


<a name="column_1144"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para68"></a>As with any government agency there were the more mundane aspects; for example, rather dilapidated buildings in remote Scottish islands, which are also part of the public service domain. The important point that I wish to make is that there have been very considerable improvements in the culture and application of design in the public service since the 1970s. As a cynic, one might say that the advertising world has had a more beneficial influence on government than it has on politics, in that respect. Certainly, the world of government is more design conscious.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para69"></a>I should like to focus a few remarks on the importance of environmental design, which the noble Lord, Lord Foster, emphasised. Perhaps one of the most important features is that good design must be fundamental and not merely an afterthought. My noble friend Lord Rogers, who regrettably could not be here today, said that environmental design was not just a question of green lipstick, which is rather a vivid expression.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para70"></a>I shall give an example. An element of design in Britain that is a bit of a scandal where environment and design could come together is noise barriers. One sees the most remarkable noise barriers in France and Germany. They are extremely important to communities as we increase our roads, and the efforts in this country are absolutely woeful.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para71"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Foster, mentioned, buildings are extremely important. Design and science must be brought together, so that designers and people involved in building regulations work together. At a conference in London recently, it was realised that the architecture profession was perhaps not as much at the forefront of pushing the agenda forward as it should be.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para72"></a>Design does not relate only to hard matter; it also affects landscapes. My wife is a landscape architect, so I hear a lot about that. Perhaps one of the triumphs of design is the good design now being applied to restoring historic landscapes, with the help of the Millennium Fund. It leads to tremendous tourism. The most widely advertised posters on the Underground may be those that concern Hampton Court and its new design. Landscape design is also extremely important on housing estates. For example, by investing in better landscape design, Peterborough was able to reduce vandalism considerably. Other noble Lords have commented about design being important in reducing waste.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para73"></a>Government managers or chief executives of government agencies will be under considerable pressure from the Treasury or their government departments to reduce their budgets, or to be as efficient as possible. Therefore, it is very important that there be as much encouragement as possible from the centre for managers to consider good design. As other noble Lords have said, the cheapest design may not be the best. It is important that agencies and departments should use a business case with a design element in their decision making.

<a name="30129-05_para74"></a>The framework documents of agencies should include the need to use good design, both in terms of their own activities and those of their contractors. I hope that the Minister will explain how the best practice is being developed to ensure those vital needs.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Kirkham: </B>   My Lords, I should like to add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, for initiating the debate, and to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foster, on a very interesting maiden speech, which lifted my spirits.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para75"></a>The debate could be more accurately headed, "How to improve the quality of life for all in the United Kingdom"&#151;and do it easily and effectively. Public services are at the very heart of our quality of life in the United Kingdom. We have no alternative but to rely on public services to a greater or lesser degree throughout our lives. Hospitals, the police service and education all impact massively on the way in which we live. The quality and relevance of the service that we receive can determine how we prosper, how we live and how we die.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para76"></a>Although investment and focus clearly are important in helping to make our public services fit for and able to support our 21st-century economy, money and attention are not enough in a world of forever-changing attitudes, values and standards, and even faster-changing technology. Public services need to do more to keep abreast of changing user requirements and new demands.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para77"></a>Business has long recognised that fact. It has recognised the colossal contribution that good design and innovation can make, and the massive impact that they can have on communication and the morale, performance and retention of staff. All that is important to public services. Design also has an impact on product quality and service and, of course, on profitability. Public services should use design in the same way.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para78"></a>The most successful example is the Department of Health, which is currently working with the Design Council on a project to "design out" medical accidents. Other government departments are working with the Design Council to develop new perspectives on old recurring problems. They clearly understand the direct read-across from good design to user satisfaction, but that is not widespread. Why not? What is the down side? It is certainly not the cost, because good and effective design pays for itself, over and again.

<a name="30129-05_para79"></a>If a better designed hospital environment helps to shorten a patient's stay, if it helps patients to retain their dignity and to recover more quickly, and if it frees beds, how much value is there in that? If our criminal population and crime are lowered by reducing the opportunity for theft through designing "crime-resistant" products, what is that worth to us? If simply the clever design of a bus shelter is not only more comfortable and better looking, but can be directly linked to lower crime levels, as it has been in South <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Yorkshire where I live, that must make design a bargain-basement investment. Design works in schools, too, where well designed lighting, heating, acoustics and furniture have been proved to yield better results.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para80"></a>We have heard already that there is no shortage of design ideas. We in the UK are the largest design workshop in the world, with almost 4,000 design consultancies that employ more than 67,000 people. In fact, last year the British design industry had export earnings of more than £1.4 billion. We lead the world in so many areas of design and have always had a spirit of invention and good ideas, from Harry Beck's London Tube map, which was designed in 1931 and still shows us the way home, to the bioform bra, the Dyson vacuum cleaner and the Millennium Bridge in Gateshead. We can choose from thousands of world-famous projects. British design successes are legend, but not in the public services. If our public services are to have any chance of meeting our growing needs and demands, the implementation of good design is not simply desirable but absolutely essential.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para81"></a> We need actively to encourage more dialogue and closer collaboration between the policy-makers, the manufacturers and the design industry, and we need to do it now. The catalyst to do that already exists in a long-established agency that makes things happen now through design initiatives in both industry and public services. That agency&#151;the Design Council&#151;has been mentioned several times.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para82"></a>The Design Council is currently funded by a DTI grant to the tune of around £7 million per annum&#151;not £70 million, but £7 million per annum. That is small change in a government context, and some might say miserly. With a wall of money descending on the public services at the moment, now is the time to invest in design. Procrastination is not a valid option. Let us involve the best in the design industry and invest creatively.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para83"></a>How we do that does not matter, but the Design Council would be a good, practical starting point. It is in a warm-start position and, if adequately funded, could massively accelerate its aim of helping to turn design ideas into actions. It could accelerate that change and move toward a better quality of life for all in the UK, and achieve that through public services that could be transformed beyond recognition through and by design.

<P>

<a name="30129-05_para84"></a>The debate is timely and important, given the Government's focus on public services and the intention of putting the patient, client, user and consumer at the centre of all provision. If those people are to be at the centre of all provision, an inclusive approach to design is essential. I want to put that in the context of this profound social revolution through which we are living: the age revolution.

<a name="30129-05_para85"></a>I was privileged to have been involved in a Design Council initiative called "Living Longer", involving Professor Roger Coleman at the Royal College of Art and the charity that I chair, the ILC-UK. We looked at design in the new context that we face. I was also involved in another initiative with the Royal Society of Arts involving an international competition for postgraduate students.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para86"></a>Many public services are no longer appropriate, given the change in the population that we are going through. The same is true of housing and consumer and household products. More older and many more disabled people are living alone and are keen to maintain their independence and, above all, their autonomy. They want to live, work, shop and enjoy their leisure in a safe and secure environment that is tailored to their needs and which adapts to their needs as they go through life and age.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para87"></a> It is the combination of the ageing population that we are experiencing with rapid technological and consequential social change that is the big issue. It is imperative to include and not exclude through design. In addition, the Disability Discrimination Act and related legislation gives rights to people who are discriminated against by bad design. They can and will take the offenders to court. That will also apply in the workplace when anti-age-discrimination legislation is introduced. There is a carrot and a stick for providers&#151;and "providers" includes government. There is a need to develop products and services that work for us all, throughout our lives, and do not present obstacles to social participation. Those that do so will succeed and those that do not will fail. That is especially true for public services and in particular for housing, transport, education, health and caring services and leisure. Those public services can and must be at the leading edge of design.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para88"></a>With regard to ageing, what Peter Laslet described as the secular shift in ageing is recent. As little as 50 years ago the probability of surviving to enjoy an extended period after work was so low as not to be worth investing in. Now everyone worries that they have invested too little, as does the state, which 50 years ago embarked on a pension scheme that involved not investment but only income and expenditure. Now we know that that is becoming unsustainable. The big thing to realise is that the shift from young to old societies has never happened before in the history of mankind. This is uncharted territory and we are all learning as we go along.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para89"></a>Instead of thinking about retirement we must think of continuing to work into our seventies. That has enormous implications for the type and extent of our public services, and not just their design in physical terms. It also means that the people involved must be involved in the actual design of what they use and need. They must participate; that includes older people and those with disabilities. They must have the goods and services that give them that possibility and ensure their continuing independence. They must be available as part of any mainstream consumer offers. If people <P>


<a name="column_1148"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are to work longer, they will also have more money to spend, and the producers of goods and services are beginning to realise that.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para90"></a>What can we do? We must encourage the adoption of inclusive design thinking and practice. People in the design profession have been working on those ideas for some years now, but inclusivity is rarely asked for in design briefs. That must change, and measures must be taken to encourage industry to change its practices in that regard and to "mainstream" inclusive design.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para91"></a> The British Standards Institution has decided to introduce a BS in the 7000 series on inclusive design management. That standard is now in the drafting stage and should be completed for publication during the course of this year. That is important because it will encourage industry to engage with those issues and, in tandem with the DDA, it will expose those that do not take reasonable steps to ensure that the design needs of older people and those with disabilities are taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para92"></a>I shall add a few examples to the many that have so far been given. We must have a "life course" approach to design and flexible homes that adapt to us as we go through life. We might want semi-independence for our teenage children but also a granny flat; it is not impossible to design homes in that way. Leisure centres and parks should cater for all ages and the judicious use of street lighting for safe and secure living has been mentioned. Glass must be used and the design of bus stations and railway stations should be considered. Schools could be very adventurous because with interactive learning age becomes irrelevant and we can have learning centres that cater for everyone&#151;teenagers and older. Interactive learning is only one part of an holistic approach to design, which can transform people's lives throughout their lives and make age in fact irrelevant.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Gavron: </B>   My Lords, I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and offer him my gratitude. He talked in a very erudite manner about the change in culture required in our attitudes to design. I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foster. It is almost impossible to discuss design in this country without quoting the noble Lord, but seeing him sitting in the Chamber rather inhibits my doing so. His was a most accomplished and remarkable speech.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para93"></a>The planning of our splendid new Royal Opera House building took more than 20 years. Several times during that period we seemed to be ready to build but when we got our quotations the price had gone up so much since the previous time that we had to stop again and raise more money. Eventually we realised it was now or never. There was still a funding gap, but we had to go ahead. We called in that brilliantly creative property developer, Sir Stuart Lipton, described by the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, as hard-headed. I agree. Sir Stuart took one look at our plans. He took one look and said, "Cut out the lowest two levels". We had been going down 60 feet. The bottom 30 feet would have cost us much more than all the other space in the <P>


<a name="column_1149"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>building. It also involved the risk of further entanglement with London Underground and with various hitherto unknown archaeological sites&#151;even at 30 feet we found a Saxon village&#151;and we would have endangered our 1858 foundations. So we took his advice. To make up for the lost basements, we had to use some office space that we had hoped to let. However, the overall financial saving pretty well closed our funding gap. Our project had been saved, not by a designer, but by an expert briefer of designers.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para94"></a>When I recently visited one of our renowned teaching hospitals for a health check, I stopped briefly at the main signboard. An elderly woman was staring at it in a bemused way. "What does that mean?", she said pointing at a sign saying "Renal Medicine". I told her. "And that?" she asked of "Podiatrics". "And that?" she asked of "Haematology". I just about knew what they were. "These signs aren't for us", she said. "They're for the doctors and nurses. If they were for us they would be in proper English; you know: 'Kidneys', 'Feet' and 'Blood'". I agreed. "What's that one?", she asked. She was looking at "Colo-rectal". I pointed at the relevant part of my anatomy. "That's me", she said, and began to march off but she stopped and spoke again. She said, "It should have said, 'Bums'". I believe that our designers of hospital signage should probably take their briefing from her.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para95"></a>Coming from a background in printing and publishing, I feel that I should mention the importance of typography and graphic design in our daily lives. As the noble Lord, Lord Foster, said, everything has to be designed: every book and every sheet of paper. The design affects not just the aesthetics but also the function of the printed product. Noble Lords may not realise it, but the speed at which one can read, absorb and remember information depends largely on its design. There is incontrovertible evidence that a well-designed textbook can be effectively read at almost twice the speed of a badly designed textbook. We all know about the pain of reading text that some designer has decided should be printed in small white type on a black background that comes off on your hands.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para96"></a>The design of the many printed forms and booklets issued by public sector organisations is variable. All express clearly the needs of the issuing body. The bad ones go no further. Good design takes the customer into account. There is great variation in the public's sensory capacities and relevant knowledge. Technical terms and small print, for example, can make form filling a nightmare for some people, especially older people.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para97"></a> Like many of my noble friends, I recently had the opportunity to discuss with someone in the Audit Commission its much talked about report on PFI schools. It is obvious that private contractors are interested in maximising their profit on each contract. In one case, a contractor, to save money, put a tin roof on an assembly hall. When it rained, not a word could be heard. That is not the fault of the Government, nor of the contractors, nor even of the architect. The specification was at fault, and the briefer who drew it up.

<a name="30129-05_para98"></a>In conclusion I return to my main theme: we must use designers for everything we make. In the UK we produce great designers, as we have heard. According to the Design Council they earned huge fees from abroad last year. Good design gives pleasure and is highly cost effective. But in order to achieve good design we need good briefing of designers. The people who brief designers in the public sector have a great effect on our daily lives. They need to be numerate, clear thinking, decisive, and have long term vision. They need to behave as if spending their own money. I commend to the Minister that they need to be fully and properly trained for their job.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-05_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Flather: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, for initiating this interesting debate. Design surrounds us all the time. We value good design when we see it, but we do not stop to think about it. I thank the noble Lord for making us think consciously about a subject that we do not normally think about. It was a privilege to hear the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank. I hope noble Lords will agree that we would like to hear more from him from time to time.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para99"></a>We have heard much about good design, but I begin with the impact of bad design. In the 1970s I became a member of the board of visitors of Holloway prison, which at that time was newly constructed. If one needed an example of impractical bad design, it was that prison. It was decided not to have bars on the women's prison, but the windows were so wide that a slim young woman could slip out. In the end they had to put bars on narrow windows which made it even darker and more unpleasant inside. One could not see very far down the corridor or what was going on around the corner. There were places where things could be thrown onto little roofs. Your Lordships would not have liked to see what used to land on those bits of roof.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para100"></a>We have to realise how destructive and expensive bad design is. It is important to start right and provide for people's needs. Good design, however, uplifts the spirit. That point has not yet been mentioned. When we go to see the Great Court at the British Museum or Tate Modern, the spirit lifts. Good design gives us much more than a space to use; it does something for our spirit.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para101"></a>I have a few points to make, which may be because I am a woman. Forgive me if my glasses keep falling off; they are not mine. It would be today that I would forget my glasses. Good lighting is important. How often lighting is relegated to being something that will happen by itself. In this country, where we have four months of almost non-stop darkness, good lighting should be at the top of everyone's list of considerations.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para102"></a>I turn to practicality and the people who are to use public spaces. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, mentioned patients, victims and so on. If they are to use a space, are they ever consulted? Do we consult patients when we design hospitals? Do we consult <P>


<a name="column_1151"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anyone else when we design facilities for those people? It is extremely important that there should be an opportunity to consult users. A working environment can succeed only if the people who are to use it are at least asked for their views about it.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para103"></a>With your Lordships' indulgence perhaps I may place a slight gloss on the debate: good design is in itself a public service. I have been involved for five years in the construction of a memorial on Constitution Hill. It is a long overdue memorial to the men from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and the West Indies who volunteered to serve with the British forces in two world wars. Somehow they have been forgotten. Nearly 5 million served in the two world wars.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para104"></a>The memorial sits on the top of Constitution Hill as one enters from Hyde Park Corner. The architect Liam O'Connor described it as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Four sculpted piers in solid stone, surmounted by bronze urns form a cenotaph, a square, a public space, sacred to the sacrifice made by a great many people.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para105"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> The space between the piers forms a perfect square . . . framing views towards the Wellington Arch to the west and a domed pavilion to the north. The pavilion forms the heart of the composition; a belvedere in the Park flanked by two plinths, each a monolith carved with campaigns from the two World Wars. Cast bronze railings with a peacock theme form balconies from which the four main piers may be viewed across the sand-ride . . .
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para106"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> Bronze lamp standards have been designed with tops to match the pavilion dome and the lotus leaf capitals re-appear as supports for the urns and the pavilion dome finial. The oak leaf section of the lamp standards re-appears as a wreath moulding to the urn bases, a reference to Lutyens' Whitehall Cenotaph".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para107"></a><P>

<a name="30129-05_para108"></a>The reference to Lutyens extends beyond the Whitehall Cenotaph, because coming from New Delhi as I do, I see echoes of Lutyens throughout the memorial. It completes Aston Webb's original plan for a gateway to that side of the park. It is a serene and beautiful memorial, with beautiful Portland stone. The construction is exquisite. I think that that is a public service. The good design of that memorial helps us to enjoy the past even more.

It was a particular pleasure for me to listen to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank, and I look forward to hearing more.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para109"></a>I shall use examples from my professional experience to demonstrate the importance of good design for healthcare. One of the essentials for the care of new-born babies&#151;especially those who are ill&#151;is a clean, warm environment with electricity and a constant supply of clean water. The facility should be close to the delivery room with access to mothers. Those two facilities should therefore be on the ground floor of a hospital. But the environment of the delivery room where the baby is born is so different from the unit for the care of newly born babies.
<P>


<a name="column_1152"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para110"></a>Keeping a new-born baby care unit clean and free of infection requires, among other measures, that all adults entering it&#151;including mothers and staff&#151;wash their hands. Only when their hands are clean should they handle babies. That is difficult to achieve because most people do not wash their hands regularly.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para111"></a>A clean supply of water 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year is a commodity that we take for granted. Most infections in a new-born care unit are water-borne because the drainage pipes of washbasins trap and breed germs, so they need to be sterilised regularly. Here is an opportunity for better design. Taps with long arms are necessary if we do not want to contaminate our washed hands when turning off the water supply.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para112"></a>Washing our hands with water regularly, before touching any baby in the care unit, will give us sore hands within two days. That is why today we wash our hands thoroughly with water and soap on entering the unit and then use antiseptic lotion to clean our hands before handling every baby thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para113"></a>Simple things can be difficult to achieve, particularly when a team of healthcare professionals is looking after a sick baby who will have visits from parents. Design and the proper use of facilities is a prerequisite for helping people who need clinical healthcare. The user of the service must be the one whose well-being determines our design of buildings and equipment. Today, we would not approve of any health service facility that does not have access for disabled patients or visitors in wheelchairs. But reception desks may still be above the eye level of people in wheelchairs.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para114"></a>Primary care trust boards are now conscious that small premises with a doctor working single-handed are no longer adequate for healthcare in the 21st century. A health centre should have facilities for services other than doctors, nurses and receptionists so that patients need not go to hospital for ECG tracings of their heart, blood tests and X-rays.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para115"></a>Automatic doors are common at the entrances of hospitals, but they are inefficient in keeping out the cold when patients insist on smoking just outside the doors.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para116"></a>Design for the safety of patients must be a high priority. For many years I worked in a unit for new-born babies that was on the fifth floor of the maternity building when delivery rooms were on the ground floor. I was informed that in 1966 the architects of that maternity building in Liverpool had not heard of the need for a new-born baby unit and had added one on the top floor rather than draw up new plans. But in Birkenhead we have the best-designed bus station in Europe. Staff working in the baby unit had to have regular practice in moving incubators and cots down five floors in case of fire. The unit was closed only two years ago.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para117"></a>Design for the safety of patients and their families requires attention to detail. Let us consider the example of the medicine bottle with a child-resistant cover containing small pills for an older person. How often have we struggled to get the child-proof top off <P>


<a name="column_1153"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the bottle, or heard grandparents asking a young grandchild to help remove the top in order to reach the tablets for their blood pressure or heart failure? There are effective bottle tops, which people with arthritis in their hands can open that are genuinely resistant to the child under five, but they are expensive.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para118"></a>Other design improvements can be life-saving, such as needles attached to syringes that do not need to be removed by hand, thereby avoiding needle-stick injuries and preventing the infection of healthcare professionals who take blood from patients with hepatitis or HIV.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para119"></a> Another improvement needed must surely be the colour coding of medical solutions for injection used for anaesthesia, treatment of severe blood-poisoning and cancers. Some injectable drugs given directly into the blood will be lethal if injected into the spinal fluid. Such drugs should be colour coded so that doctors will be warned, and patients protected from medical accidents and death.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para120"></a>Finally, I shall quote from the Design Council, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Good design creates products, systems and environments that can help improve the outcomes of healthcare, providing more effective and safer services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para121"></a><P>

<a name="30129-05_para122"></a>Designing for patient safety must be the highest priority. Therefore, I welcome the news that the Department of Health is working with the Design Council to investigate the potential for a design-led approach to reducing the opportunity for medical error as part of its on-going "Building a safer NHS" patient safety strategy.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para123"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response to the debate.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-05_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble friend on the masterly way in which he has addressed a complex and extremely broad subject.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para124"></a>In the short time that I have to speak, I want to touch, first, on the importance of teaching good design in schools and, more particularly, art colleges. I draw attention to the work of the Royal Society of Art and its student design awards scheme, which attracts more than 3,000 entries a year. The RSA increasingly sees its role as helping to set the agenda for design colleges by bringing in fresh new thinking. I find it rather refreshing that this ancient body, whose full title is the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce, should be so active in promoting new ideas.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para125"></a>The RSA drew attention to some worrying trends. The huge increase in student numbers has resulted in a dramatic change in student:staff ratios. That, in turn, has led to a loss in the quality of teaching. The RSA questions whether it can retain its pre-eminent position in design education. Sadly I do not have the time to mention its consequential observations.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para126"></a>I turn to buildings. About 10 years ago the Royal Fine Arts Commission published an admirable study called, What makes a good building?. Incidentally, the <P>


<a name="column_1154"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>study was commissioned by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, when he was the Culture Secretary. The final words of that excellent report are as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To achieve a good building requires a good brief, a good client and a good architect . . . It is not a simple matter, and requires great effort and passionate commitment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para127"></a><P>

<a name="30129-05_para128"></a>I think that we had the passionate commitment from the noble Lord, Lord Foster, in his masterly maiden speech.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para129"></a>I want to talk about the brief and the client&#151;the procurement process. My first point has already been made, but it is worth repeating that research both at home and abroad shows that investment in good design generates economic and social value. This is not a novel point among professionals, but decision-makers, such as the Treasury, often tend to forget it. If I have time, I may come back to that issue.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para130"></a>Sir Stuart Lipton, who has already been mentioned by a number of speakers, the chairman of the RFAC's successor body, the Commission for Architecture and the Building Environment&#151;CABE&#151;reminds us that the Government are now embarking on the most significant building programme since the 1960s. Therefore, the stakes have been upped and the procurement process becomes all important. In the same piece, where he spoke about the big spending ahead of us, Sir Stuart Lipton was fairly scathing about some of our new buildings.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para131"></a>I want to touch on one or two consequential issues. First&#151;again, the point has already been made but I repeat it&#151;how can we ensure good design in PFI contracts, or, to put it the other way round, how can we design the form of PFI contracts so that good design is ensured?
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para132"></a>Secondly, how can the Treasury, for example, be made to understand that building economics on the basis of lifetime costs is far more efficient and better than the normal Treasury regime of the initial cash budget approach? Of course, the Treasury denies that. It says that we have manuals on how to proceed with such matters, but, when the chips are down, it is cash that matters.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para133"></a> Thirdly, how do we prevent what I call "design degradation", which usually comes about when endeavouring to economise on detailing or qualities of finish&#151;for example, door knobs and so on&#151;when budget problems arise during construction? I draw attention to the issue but have no time to go into it.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para134"></a>Fourthly, how can we encourage the participation of innovative small sub-contractors; for example, in relation to furniture and furnishings and so on? The red tape of the billing process can constitute a crippling overhead.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para135"></a>It is so easy to identify the problems and so difficult to find solutions. In brief, how do we train and educate our officials not only in the virtues of good design but in identifying, and distinguishing between, good and bad? I believe that the answer is to educate and train officials at&#151;I emphasise&#151;all levels.

<a name="30129-05_para136"></a>I must conclude. I should have liked to link building design to urban planning. But, again, the noble Lord, Lord Foster, took us down that path and spoke in his outstanding maiden speech far better and with far more authority than I could have done.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, when thinking of what to say in this debate, I looked in the Oxford English Dictionary and found that the word "design", simply as a noun, has eight definitions. Number five was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a crafty contrivance or hypocritical scheming".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para137"></a>
I am afraid that for some design&#151;or perhaps lack of design&#151;that definition may occasionally be apposite.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para138"></a>I was much helped in preparing these remarks by the recent short document published by the Commission on Architecture and the Built Environment, referred to by a number of noble Lords. On the very first page, the results of a MORI poll show that 81 per cent of the population are interested in how the built environment looks and feels. Even more people&#151;85 per cent&#151;agree that better quality buildings improve the quality of people's lives.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para139"></a>Those findings, which show such a high awareness among the general public, perhaps explain some of the other positive research findings in the report. One has been given by the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg. Another is a study by the University of Nottingham, which found that in a cardiology ward which had been fitted with improved lighting, better external views and other improvements, patients' blood pressure and pulse rates were significantly lower and post-operative stays came down from 11 to eight days.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para140"></a>My own medical practice moved into a newly built health centre in the mid-1970s. It was in advance of its time and had carefully thought-out plans to enhance joint working between doctors, nurses and other primary care team members. At the planning stage, there was much discussion between the staff who were going to use the building and the architect. However, due to cost-cutting during construction, the fabric of the building began to fail at an early stage so that now, 30 years later, it is having to be extensively rebuilt. That is an example of how skimping on building costs, despite a good conceptual design, can lead to greater expense in the long term.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para141"></a>On my way to my home in East Sussex, I often pass the remarkable development known as "BedZED"&#151;the Beddington Zero Energy Development&#151;in the borough of Sutton. This is a high-density housing project of around 100 homes. It is immediately arresting because of the brightly coloured wind-driven, heat-exchanging ventilators, which swivel on the roofs&#151;a system rather similar to that used in Portcullis House.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para142"></a>There are many other novel features&#151;many more than I can describe&#151;including a small biofuel combined heat and power unit. Energy consumption in the dwellings is only 10 per cent of that in a comparable traditional dwelling. That 10 per cent of energy is produced on site. The project was developed by the Peabody Trust to the design of architect Bill <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Dunster who first tried out the design concepts when building his own house. It is a superb example of good design and environmental conservation, and the cost of building it was no greater than that of a conventional housing development.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para143"></a>Like other noble Lords, I want to refer briefly to the Audit Commission's report on PFI in schools. It shows that, of the 10 traditional and eight PFI schools studied by the Building Research Establishment, the PFI schools were, on average, worse in all five aspects of design quality used. However, to be fair, one PFI school was commended. Its quality may have been high because the head teacher was involved in the project negotiation from the start. It is a key feature of a successfully designed building that the eventual user, who may not be the commissioning agent, should be involved from the start.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para144"></a> The summary of the final chapter comments:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a strong case for changing capital funding incentives to enable options other than the PFI to be pursued equally advantageously".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-05_para145"></a>
It was very audacious of the Audit Commission to give advice to the Treasury. But surely the main reason for using PFI in the first place was to shift the burden of raising capital from the public to the private sector and, thus, the debt incurred would not appear on the Government's balance sheet. But the debt is still there, of course, and it costs the public considerably more to service than a state-secured loan. In addition, as the report shows, the product that results may be less suitable, of inferior quality and have higher maintenance costs. All that is because of an inflexible Treasury rule not to increase visible public sector borrowing.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para146"></a>Good design may initially cost a little more in time and thought, although not necessarily in money. But the end result is more pleasing to the eye and more efficient, costs less to maintain and is kinder to the environment.

His family's ancestral courage is well known, but the personal imaginativeness of the subjects which he chooses to bring before your Lordships' House for debate deserves separate praise. He has also on this occasion given us the opportunity to hear the notable maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para147"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, referred to 19th century prisons. There is a great continuity in our affairs. I mention the prison that Bentham built&#151;the Millbank Penitentiary, where the Tate now stands. Not for nothing was he a utilitarian. Five prisoners were lodged in a group of cells but there were washing facilities for all of them from the start. Judge Tumim could not have approved more.

<P>

<a name="30129-05_para149"></a>Others have quoted the Design Council report. In the spirit of the quotation given by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, the observation in the report that the input of end users is most valuable at the start of the process, before the designs have been made and before the cost of change grows prohibitively high, was the story of how Japanese ship-building took over the world.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para150"></a>My father's philosophy tutor became the controller of metals during World War II. My father asked what his qualifications were and he said, "They are two. The first is that I am trained to ask questions&#151;there are a large number of questions to ask in the context of metals. The second is that everyone else in metals has an emotional involvement in particular metals like wolfram and tungsten, but I have no emotional involvement in any of them". The creation of a post within Government with the oriental title "The Great Questioner" would do design a great favour.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para151"></a>I was lucky enough to attend a school founded in 1843 where, around a fine early 18th century house, the governors employed Blore, Street&#151;I spent four years in a boarding house designed by Street who put concrete into a domestic building for the first time&#151;Norman Shaw, Bodley, Comper, Aston Webb and WG Newton whose science laboratories were among the 50 first 20th century buildings to be listed. There was even a Waterhouse cricket pavilion, perhaps his only one, which the school has just restored to Waterhouse's original design. The child is father to the man and these things teach one what is possible.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para152"></a>One of the earliest boys to attend the school&#151;in the school's first five years&#151;was William Morris. It is interesting to note that what made the most impression on him during his school days was Avebury seven miles away. I remark that Avebury is essentially a public sector artefact.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para153"></a>From that school I also took away the recognition that people behave as a result of the way in which they are treated&#151;whether it is listed blocks of council flats in Pimlico, the design of the legendary Thomas Telford School in Shropshire, with its academic success, or the new Jubilee Line stations that won the buildings of the year prize, competing, coincidentally, in the small change of today's debate, against a bus shelter in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para154"></a>To draw on Waterhouse's cricket pavilion, I shall add to the list of design successes in the public services. I cite topically the English Cricket Board's use of the national curriculum, initially to design coursework and teaching aids based on cricket&#151;arithmetic, geometry and physics come first to mind&#151;but more subliminally to get school children interested in cricket as well.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para155"></a>Thirty-five years ago I called on the enlightened managing director of a public but smallish company in the Black Country who had just sent a new appointee <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to his board on a three-month sabbatical all around Europe to refresh himself and to look at recent capital investments by industrial companies. I ask the Minister how far that example is followed in the public sector today.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para156"></a>All of that said, we should not rely blindly on innovation. I saw the Nottinghamshire County Council's winning exhibit at the Milano Biennale in the winter of 1960 of a CLASP prefabricated school, and I flushed with national pride. But 25 years later I was a DES Minister when the CLASP schools all needed renewal at the same time.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para157"></a>Finally, a cheering coincidence. Like the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, in 1961 I furnished my first office from the Design Council's design index. On that index was only one hatstand. I loyally and blindly bought it. The other day I was in Bond Street where the Fine Arts Society was selling a Charles Rennie Mackintosh hatstand for £35,000. In life, as in the Bible, the bread that one casts upon the waters comes back after many days.

<A NAME="30129-05_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </B>   My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, for initiating the debate. It provides a timely opportunity to acknowledge the importance of design in all parts of public life. It also allows me to stress how important the higher education sector is for encouraging improvements in design in public services and more generally. I declare an interest as chief executive of Universities UK.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para158"></a>Too often the role of design is forgotten. Universities have a central role in research, teaching and knowledge transfer in all areas of design. Our universities have a reputation as world leaders in creativity and innovation. That is a reputation on which they are keen to build.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para159"></a>Design is just one of the 13 creative industries defined by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Others include architecture, music, performing arts, publishing and software and computer services. The creative industries in the UK are a massive success story. They generate revenues of some £112.5 billion, employ something like 1.3 million people, contribute around £10.3 billion in exports and account for over 5 per cent of GDP.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para160"></a>The universities already make an enormous contribution to improving the delivery of public services. They train the professionals on whom we rely. We might ask what that has to do with design. In the context of this debate, it means not so much the doctors, lawyers and engineers of whom we normally think, but the designers and architects whose creative vision provides modern hospitals with specialist equipment, attractive living accommodation in towns and the countryside, bridges across our rivers, new transport systems and so on. Design is not a sideline in universities but a mainstream activity.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para161"></a>I shall take 2000&#150;01 as an example. In that year there were well over 40,000 full-time undergraduates taking degrees in design studies. In addition, there were <P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>almost 6,000 more who were studying courses that included elements of design. That enormous number means that just over half of all creative arts students in our universities were studying design. It does not stop with undergraduates. Also in that year there were almost 3,000 postgraduate students studying design, either as their sole area of study or as a component.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para162"></a> I think that that makes it clear that without the work of our universities there could be little possibility of improved design in our public services. Like other noble Lords I pay tribute to the enormous amount of work carried out by the Design Council in promoting the excellence of UK design. I was delighted to see its recent publication, Meeting of Minds. It illustrates universities' role in design, innovation and research and highlights what business and public services gain from working with universities.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para163"></a>I am delighted to use an example which will be close to the heart of the noble Lord, Lord Foster. I compliment him on his enlightening and uplifting maiden speech. I give the example of the partnership between Primal Pictures and University College London. Supported by the DTI and the Medical Research Council, that partnership led to the development of the interactive hand, a 3D virtual model of a hand, a new and important teaching and reference aid for the medical profession.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para164"></a>Where else are universities having an impact? The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, will be pleased with my second example, as it demonstrates the progress for which he was looking. Brunel University has been involved in a project to design millennium homes that will be designed with state-of-the-art technology to enable elderly people to live independently in their own homes for longer. I could quote many more examples.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para165"></a>Where do we go from here? How do we increase the skills base of our designers so that they can help to improve the delivery of public services? How can we ensure that more of the innovation in design in our universities can be put at the disposal of the public sector? First, I hope that the Government will remember the importance of design and the other creative industries as they consider how they implement last week's White Paper on higher education.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para166"></a>In that light, I welcome wholeheartedly the announcement that there will be an arts and humanities research council by 2005, although I have a concern about the possible direction of research funding in the White Paper. It is important that the council will be able to support emerging centres of excellence and not just those that are already world leaders. It is an area of growth and innovation and if we stop innovating it will soon die.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para167"></a>I also hope that the Government will continue to press for overt reference to arts and humanities in the design of important research initiatives in Europe, such as the future framework programmes and the European research area. Finally, I hope that the White Paper will result in additional funds to teach the next <P>

<P>

<a name="30129-05_para168"></a>I am no expert on design, but as a layman who is constantly the end-user of products and of public services, I want to share my views on good and bad design. I should like to talk about our built environment. Whether housing or office space, it affects our quality of life and output. A badly designed house or office has an adverse effect on our behaviour, work and well-being. About 20 years ago, I was involved in the development of an institutional building in the centre of London, and have been fortunate to be able to build a small house for my family to the west of London. Perhaps I may share some of my experiences with your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para169"></a>The institutional building required office space, conference and meeting facilities and a community hall. We had a sensitive owner and architect, both conscious of the need for a building that would cater for a large number of people using its facilities, taking into account movement from one space to another and providing sufficient lighting and good, well-designed furniture. Above all, the building would have to stand up to constant use by a large number of people.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para170"></a>Many believe that architects and builders are the decision-makers. My experience is that unless end-users are brought in from the beginning and their views sought at the planning stage, the whole development will be a disaster. We shared the architect's initial drawings with the end-users and, indeed, with the neighbours. We asked whether they liked the plant and facilities and whether they wanted anything added or deleted. Photomontages were produced to show how the new building would sit with the existing, neighbouring buildings.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para171"></a>Although that process was painful, time-consuming and expensive, it enabled us to develop a building that truly reflected the needs of end-users. My point is that good design of a building is not the sole domain of the architect, but needs involvement from the owner, user, builder, building material supplier and craftsmen. We spent much time on the building materials and quality of workmanship. We searched for and found the most suitable materials and the best workmen to execute the final product.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para172"></a>A plaster ceiling in one part of the building won an award, but the most fascinating incident involved a teak wood bench designed and placed in one circulation area near a glass window. I found myself with the carpenter who had made the bench and the designer. They were arguing about who was the creator of that beautiful product. The bench, under the window with the sun pouring through, cast a beautiful shadow on the marble floor below. The bench was beautiful and so was the shadow. They finally settled <P>


<a name="column_1161"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the compromise that the design was that of the designer but the shadow belonged to the carpenter. The pride in the design of that simple bench and of the craftsman who had built it with loving hands was evident.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para173"></a>I have been watching the people who use the building for a long time to see whether such a well-designed and built work space has any effect on the quality of their lives and output. Surprisingly, I constantly notice the huge change in the way people use the building and how a well-designed space affects the quality and output of their work. Working in a good environment automatically makes them conscious of the stationery they use, the publications they produce and the manner in which they organise social and other events. I often find them arguing about whether the kind of event they are planning will match the beautiful building in which they are located. Working out the most minute detail of such events reflects the detail of the way in which the building was built and is maintained. As a whole, I can say that that well-designed building raises standards of output and presentation and reflects on the people who use the building. There seems to be a direct relationship between a well-built environment and the quality of the work carried out in that space.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para174"></a>We all see the huge number of new office buildings being constructed in London. We hear about modern buildings of all shapes and sizes being built to attract and accommodate new businesses and investments. Some of those new developments are unattractive and unpleasant to look at. I do not understand why planning authorities allow such buildings to be constructed. I am often told that such structures are built to last for no more than 25 or 30 years because the land value is so large that the developers can knock the building down in 30 years and build yet another atrocity in its place to meet the demand for office space. So good design&#151;external and internal&#151;is sacrificed on the altar of more space for a short-term gain. Some of the new buildings in the City of London today bear witness to that phenomenon.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para175"></a>About 12 years ago, I was fortunate enough to build a small house for my family in the west of London. Being able to build something from the ground up in London had been only a dream. The best I had hoped for was converting an existing building to my needs&#151;never the best solution. However, I found a piece of ground on which I could build something to suit my needs. I made contact with a local architect, who said, "Yes, I can design two nice bedrooms upstairs and a living/dining room space downstairs". It took me some time and effort to explain to him that I knew what I wanted. I sketched it for him on a piece of paper. He sat there looking at me in disbelief and said: "This is probably the first time I have met a client who knows what he wants". It was obvious to me that he had never asked what the client wanted.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para176"></a>We got on splendidly well thereafter until we started to talk about the internal finishing and designing. It soon became obvious to him that he was designing a house for a person from a different culture. <P>


<a name="column_1162"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Fortunately, a lucky event saved us both a lot of trouble. I happened to be travelling to India for some work and invited the architect to come with me to see some of my cultural heritage. We agreed that he was not to copy anything that he saw but was going there simply to understand his client's cultural background.
<P>

<a name="30129-05_para177"></a>It was one of the best things that happened to him and to me. On our return, his words were, "I think that I understand you better". From thereon he completed the design of the house, which was reviewed in the Financial Times, House and Garden and a couple of other arts and architecture magazines. I have now lived in the house for the past 12 years. I consider it a well-designed space&#151;of course, I would say so&#151;in which I feel comfortable because it is built to meet my needs.

<A NAME="30129-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, during one of the last warm days of autumn, I took my three children on the riverboat from Greenwich to Westminster. As is the custom, one of the boatmen offered us a running commentary as we went down the river. As we passed the headquarters of the Greater London Authority on our left, he said, "And there, on our left, is the new headquarters of the Greater London Authority. As you can see, it was designed by an under-employed window cleaner".
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para0"></a>It was a great honour today to hear from that under-employed window cleaner. I thought that I would tell the noble Lord that story because he has had so much praise today that he should hear at least one word from his critics. It was a great pleasure to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Foster.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para1"></a>My other problem arises from hearing the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg. As noble Lords may know, I am one of the revolutionaries concerning reform of this House, and yet, whenever I get out the tumbrels for the hereditaries I think of the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and his contribution to this House. Yet again, he has made a major contribution by raising the issue of design, and we are all in his debt for that.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para2"></a>My interest in design originated with my membership of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in another place, then as director-general of the British Retail Consortium in the mid-1980s, and then, since entering this House, becoming associated with the campaigning groups, Anti Copying in Design, known as ACID, and the Federation Against Copyright Theft. Much of their work is about protecting creativity in areas such as music, film and product design, but protecting a good idea and rewarding creativity applies equally to the power and direction of public service procurement.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para3"></a>I agree with the Prime Minister that Britain's future lies in creating a high-skill, high-tech, high value-added economy. But to create and sustain such an economy it is essential that ideas, innovation and <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>design distinctiveness are protected and that the ideas of men and women of innovation are protected by law. That has been one of my interests in the House.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para4"></a>This excellent debate has drawn on the brief produced by the Design Council, which is among my papers. I shall not repeat many of the points that other noble Lords have referred to except to point out that, although it may be a brief for the converted, as the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, said, it would be well worthy of wider distribution, if only to provide the proselytizers of good design with a good document from which to work.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para5"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, that design has great importance in ensuring that our public services are taken up. Too many buildings that house organisations which offer help seem to say not "We are here to help" but "Abandon hope all ye who enter here". It is true that good design can make a building appear friendly to people who may be a little cautious about becoming entangled in the bureaucracy of public service.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para6"></a>Throughout the debate various themes have been taken up&#151;for example, how good design can help in the areas of health and education; in sport and leisure, an issue to which the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, referred; and in tourism. I agree that good signage can be a great help to tourism.

<a name="30129-06_para7"></a>As to housing and housing design in the public sector, I can remember going round a council estate in Southwark with a local councillor 30 years ago, at the beginning of my political career, and him standing there with real pride, looking at the high rise flats and saying, "When I see those high rise flats I see socialism in action". It is worthwhile designers and planners reminding themselves that sometimes they can get it disastrously wrong. Those high rise flats, which were built with such good intentions and such worthy aims, created massive social problems that we have spent many of the past 20 or 30 years trying to repair. In addition to the many virtues advocated today, I urge on the designers and planners a tad of humility.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para8"></a>Another area where public service lateral thinking as regards design can help is in the design of built-in deterrents against theft. Too many products are too easy to steal. There have been exchanges in the House about mobile phones and how slow the companies were in building-in anti-theft devices. Before that, the manufacturers of cars were similarly accused.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para9"></a>There is a whole range of areas in the public service where positive thinking can be of help. We have all learnt something today. Having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, speak about his hat-stand, my noble friend Lord Rodgers will probably now rush home and take a close look at his Festival of Britain cups and spoons. I recommend that he takes them to the next edition of the "Antiques Roadshow" because he might have some worthwhile heirlooms on his hands.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para10"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Rodgers, I left another place by public demand. One of the nice things about it is that I occasionally get invited back to my old constituency. On 28th March I shall be going back to <P>


<a name="column_1164"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Stockport to address the Stockport Chamber of Commerce annual dinner and to present prizes at a design award ceremony. The competition, which was sponsored by the Stockport Chamber of Commerce, Stockport Council and the local community, was to redesign the centre of Stockport.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para11"></a> One of the lessons to come through the debate is that end users must be involved in design right from the beginning. I am going back to Stockport with a real sense of pleasure&#151;although slightly fraudulently because it is my membership of the All-Party Design Group which gives me the qualities to present the prizes. As my colleagues know, I have not been renowned in the past for my Armani suits or design consciousness.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para12"></a>The arguments that provoked the competition in Stockport could be rehearsed elsewhere. Good design is a win-win situation. It is a win for the citizen as a taxpayer because, as speaker after speaker has emphasised, good design brings good value. It is a winner for the citizen as the consumer of these services because, again as other noble Lords have emphasised, good design helps the consumer. My Whip is wagging his finger but, if he reads the whip, he will see that I have got 10 minutes. Whips try to control everything.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para13"></a>Finally, as my 10 minutes come up, let me say that good design is good for UK plc. I work with one of the big trade associations&#151;the electrical manufacturers&#151;and it is still in Britain because of the quality of design. Whether in manufacturing or public services, the lesson to be learnt is that design is not the cherry on the cake but the real heart of success.

<A NAME="30129-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, for several things; first, for having introduced the debate; secondly, for himself having introduced it so well; thirdly, for having introduced a debate which has caused so many excellent, interesting and different speeches to be made; fourthly, as my noble friend Lord Brooke said, for giving us an opportunity publicly to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank, on his excellent maiden speech; and, fifthly, for his adventurous spirit in introducing a debate that is more about ideas than anything tangible. It is true that the ideas have to be linked with discipline and experience, as many noble Lords have said, but the whole concept is very interesting.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para14"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Rea, I looked up the definition of "design" in the dictionary. The definition I came up with is completely different from his&#151;I did not notice that there were seven others&#151;and states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The art of producing plans, sketches or concepts"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-06_para15"></a>
 I emphasise the word "concepts"&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the making or production of a building, machine, garment or other object".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-06_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30129-06_para17"></a>I stress the word "concept" because the Design Council, of which the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, is a member, in its brief for the debate, attaches the word "design" not only to physical objects such as I have described but to much more abstract matters.
<P>


<a name="column_1165"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para18"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and the House will forgive me if I do not attempt to deal with the philosophical concepts of design&#151;other noble Lords have spoken to that issue. It will be easier for me if I speak to the more tangible purposes and the need for good, better physical design.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para19"></a>My personal approach to the tangible nature of design is best expressed by the well-known quotation, to which I am glad no one else has referred today because I do not want to feel that I am repeating other noble Lords, from the American poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, which is generally summarised as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If a man build a better mousetrap . . . the world will beat a path to his door".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-06_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30129-06_para21"></a>One of my own experiences of the effect of better design was an advertisement, which many noble Lords may remember, from 25 years ago when a company introducing tea used a very elegant-looking teapot. I do not know how much tea the company sold but it was said at the time that thousands of the teapots practically walked off the shelves. I still have one that I use today.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para22"></a>"Design" is not simply about building a better, better-looking or more efficient mousetrap. It is about finding what is sometimes described as a gap in the market, discovering an unfulfilled need and devising the means of filling it. It was so interesting to hear different people's experiences. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, talked about having to design things differently for the older person. Like the noble Lord, Lord Chan, I cannot open that wretched thing for pills that is supposed to be safe for children. Everything has had to change considerably. So discovering an unfulfilled need and devising the means of filling it is very interesting and worth while.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para23"></a>I remember my first experience of using a mobile phone&#151;it was during an election in 1984. It was a great big heavy thing; you had to carry around heavy batteries because the thing never lasted long before it needed charging up again. I did not think that it was much use, but today, mobile phones are light and tiny. The only thing you need is good eyesight so that you can see the numbers. However, you can do all sorts of things such as sending text messages and photographs. I have just learnt to do that, which is why I mentioned it&#151;I would not have done so otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para24"></a>A new world-wide industry, of vast economic significance, has developed because of the improved design of the equipment and the technology which, within a generation or so, will make the public phone booth as obsolete as the gas lamp which, in turn, disappeared as a result of the introduction of the better designed, more efficient and less labour-intensive electric lamp standard.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para25"></a>It is clear that design is not limited to making objects better; it is also about bringing into existence more efficient and functional objects. Perhaps this is what the Design Council means when it talks about producing environments for people to work in that are more pleasant or promote more efficient operations&#151;or, preferably, both.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para26"></a>Britain has long been a leader in design in every aspect of invention or in the delivery of services. The Moscow underground may be something of great beauty, but the London Underground map is a classic of design that has stood the test of decades. It has survived the introduction of several additional subway lines and is a model of clarity for locals and foreigners who need to find their way around. In fact, as my noble friend Lord Kirkham mentioned, that is especially so when we compare it with the maps of the Paris Metro or the New York subway. I do not want to be rude to them, but they resemble plates of spaghetti.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para27"></a>The London Underground map is an outstanding case of design improving public service. It also shows that good design can be timeless. In my former business, I used a machine for filling envelopes with forms and literature which is still used to this day. I was amazed to find that the machine that I used was designed in 1906. Apart from adjusting the use of simple knobs rather than complicated nuts and screws it was, in effect, exactly the same. Similarly, the qwerty keyboard, on which I typed my notes today, has served English-speaking typists throughout the world for almost 100 years.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para28"></a>It is beyond argument that well designed schools and classrooms are just as essential for encouraging learning and good teaching as well designed text books, while old-fashioned, decrepit classrooms encourage slovenly habits among the pupils.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para29"></a> Like the noble Lord, Lord Gavron, I am moving on rather quickly, as time is passing and much of what I was going to say has been said.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para30"></a>In a series of searching Written Questions in another place last summer and autumn, the honourable Member for Stourbridge elicited the information that although the Department for Education and Skills had one of the ministerial design champions, it had not sponsored a single project&#151;at least, not as at 26th February 2002.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para31"></a>By contrast, it is a totally different story at the Department of Health. Research has come up with the fairly obvious conclusion, which many noble Lords have mentioned today, that medical treatment is better and recovery quicker in a pleasant, well designed hospital than in one that resembles a Victorian workhouse.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para32"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, is the ministerial design champion for the Department of Health. Scouring through a series of Written Answers, I see that he is commendably mentoring four National Health Service schemes in central Manchester, Birmingham, Leicester and Walsall. To its credit, the Department of Health employs 47 chartered surveyors, 14 architects and four town planners in addition to outside specialist expertise. When someone who knows what to do harnesses that knowledge with whoever is to design a project, that makes it so much better.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para33"></a>Public transport is another important matter, particularly the objective of persuading more people to use it rather than their cars. I suspect that penal taxes will not be the answer. Instead, getting people to <P>


<a name="column_1167"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abandon their cars and use public transport needs an adequate number of buses and trains, running with adequate frequency and on schedule. No less important is that those buses and trains should be well designed and comfortable. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made similar comments when he was talking about the design of trains and being packed in like sardines. That is hopeless&#151;who wants to use that as an alternative to a comfortable car?
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para34"></a>I give credit, however, to the Civil Service for the efforts that it has conspicuously made over many years to redesign many of the forms that it sends us for a variety of purposes, so that they are clearer and easier to fill in by members of the public. The noble Lord, Lord Gavron, mentioned that as well. Doubtless, they are better because it is probably easier for computers to read them, but it is very important none the less.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para35"></a>The debate has shown that there is a consensus in favour of good design, not just for aesthetic reasons but for sound, commercial and environmental reasons, and in the interests of efficiency, delivering essential public services. I shall be very interested, as I am sure all your Lordships will be, in hearing the thoughts that the Government have to offer, not in the form of general platitudes or talk about more departmental design champions, but indicating what active steps they are taking to encourage good design in every field in which the Government, as the font of all public services, have an interest.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="30129-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, on securing this quite excellent debate. As the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, said, it comes at an important time. This Government have increased levels of capital investment in our public services to their highest, in real terms, for well over a generation. In just four years, we have doubled levels of investment to some £38 billion in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para36"></a>I echo, too, the views of my noble friend Lord Pendry and others. These levels of capital investment are essential to deliver our main ambition, which is the reform of public services. The relationship between this ambition and the role of good design can be simply stated. Understanding and responding to customer experience is the key to successful public service reforms. By redesigning our systems for tracking the views of the users of our public services, we can then redesign services to match more closely the public's needs and priorities. As the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, and the noble Lord, Lord Bhatia, have emphasised, we need that stronger focus on customer needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para37"></a>The Government also believe that it is vital that public servants, politicians and other professionals think imaginatively about innovative ways in which we can realise the huge potential of good design to improve and even revolutionise sectors of our public services. As the Prime Minister stated when launching the Better Public Buildings initiative in 2000, we have <P>


<a name="column_1168"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>asked Ministers and departments to achieve real change in the quality of design across the public sector so that we leave a legacy of well liked public buildings delivering well appreciated public services.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para38"></a>Good design is not just a matter of aesthetics, although we should always be aware of the profound impact of attractive products and distinctive buildings on the reputation of institutions and towns and the self-esteem of those who live and work in them. Good design is also about utility and service delivery. Better designed hospitals allow medical staff to deliver higher standards of healthcare and encourage patients to get better quicker, as we have heard. Staff and pupils can no doubt advise on how better designed schools can make teaching more pleasant and productive. Carefully designed local environments help the police to fight crime and promote community safety. In short, good design is a necessity for all our people, not a costly indulgence for a minority of aesthetes.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para39"></a>I hope to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, therefore, that this Government have learnt from experience that good design need not cost more over the lifetime of the product or building. That is a lesson my colleagues in the Treasury would readily endorse. Good design can also demonstrate how new technology can promote better ways to build, manage and maintain new facilities. When one considers that design investment is usually only about 0.1 per cent of the total cost of building, maintaining and delivering services within a public building, one can see the potential for improvement. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally, warned, whether through municipal ambition or private speculative building, all around us in the public realm is the dismal evidence of past failure and the false economy of saving through the neglect of decent design.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para40"></a>As my noble friend Lord Borrie said, we must be alert to the lessons of that history. Given past mistakes, this Government have also had to start from a poor position. In contracting, the public sector was not often a competent client. In the 1980s and 1990s, building projects typically suffered cost over-runs and delays of some 60 per cent. That is why we invited Sir John Egan to produce his report on Rethinking Construction, which demonstrates how the standardisation of procurement techniques and the transfer of construction risk to the private sector could help us control our capital expenditure plans. By setting tough targets, we now have far more buildings delivered on time, on budget and with fewer defects.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para41"></a>I, too, share the fond memories of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, of those exciting early days of the Design Council in the 1950s and 1960s. He was pleased to learn that we have resourced two organisations&#151;the Design Council and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE)&#151;to champion the pursuit of quality design across the procurement process. We understand that we can achieve the most efficient procurement process in the world, but unless we have a committed client working with talented designers, we will still end up with a poor product. We need only to look back at some of the disastrous public building strategies of the 1960s to see that future generations <P>


<a name="column_1169"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will scrutinise our contribution according to what we deliver, not just how fast we deliver, on the planned £38 billion spend. We, too, want to ensure that PFI projects do not skimp on design, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, fears.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para42"></a>We certainly have no cause for complacency. As the Audit Commission recently reminded us in respect of school design, we are still not achieving on a consistent basis the standards we strive for. Nevertheless, in responding to the debate, I want first to set out what we consider we have achieved to date before considering what more we need to do.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para43"></a>We have heard from distinguished former Ministers, such as the noble Lords, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville and Lord Wakeham, who in their time effectively championed good design and we try to maintain that tradition. Following the launch of the Better Public Buildings programme in 2000, the Prime Minister appointed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, to chair a group of ministerial design champions.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para44"></a>A Minister champions good design in each government department with a significant capital expenditure programme. This group has been meeting for more than two years and it has made impressive progress. Each department now has a clear action plan for improving design standards which it is systematically implementing. Those are monitored by the CABE.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para45"></a> That system of champions has been replicated across the public sector so that, for example, every NHS trust&#151;hospital and primary care&#151;now has its own design champion. The same applies to regional development agencies, the Housing Corporation and a growing number of local authorities. Each Minister is personally mentoring between one and four large capital projects to understand and influence the procurement process first hand.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para46"></a>Each department has been working hard to improve design standards. The importance of design in healthcare is reflected in empirical evidence from around the world, which demonstrates that high standards of design lead to quicker patient recovery times and improved levels of staff recruitment and retention.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para47"></a>Let me amplify the example of good practice in health given by the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and cite one of the studies mentioned by my noble friend Lord Rea. The University of Nottingham compared three healthcare environments before and after they were redesigned. The schemes included a cardiology ward with improved lighting, better external views and the clustering of beds in smaller groups; and a coronary day-care unit with better beds and patient facilities, larger windows and a visitors area. Measured healthcare improvements included lower pulse rate and blood pressure readings among patients; shorter post-operative stays&#151;eight days down from 11 days; and lower prescribed drug intakes. That is a remarkable outcome and the contribution of the noble <P>


<a name="column_1170"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Chan, a distinguished paediatrician, is a personal testament to the importance of design for patients.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para48"></a>The Department of Health recognised early on that the NHS was achieving inconsistent standards of design in the early stages of its hospital building programme. There were some clear winners, such as the Norwich and Norfolk hospital, but some designs were out-dated in terms of our desire to create patient-focused environments. As a result, the NHS appointed His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales as its design champion and has partnered CABE on a variety of initiatives to improve standards. It has set up a design review process, which should help reassure your Lordships, so that every new hospital project is scrutinised for its quality at the key stage of the PFI process. It has revised its guidance to ensure that it reflects up-to-date healthcare management.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para49"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Chan, may know, the NHS has also introduced a system of design quality indicators to help all the users of a hospital to be involved in the design process. Finally, it has sent the CABE to help individual hospitals and primary healthcare providers in the early stages of the design process. On hospital signage, I trust that the designers will take note of the lady mentioned by my noble friend Lord Gavron, who, like myself, does not have the Latin, and design something more functional.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para50"></a>The recent Audit Commission report tells a similar story in the education sector. A few years ago, the then Secretary of State for Education asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to explore the main impacts of capital investment in schools on pupil performance. It found that capital investment had the strongest influence on staff morale, pupil motivation and effective learning times. In the early years of this Government, we found that there was a considerable variation in the extent to which the LEAs and individual schools were responding to the design challenge. There were some real success stories, but too many schools were providing environments that were functional but not inspiring.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para51"></a>In response, the DfES has partnered both the CABE and the Design Council to drive the message home. The CABE is now working with every LEA going into a major round of PFI school procurement to act as a confidant and adviser in the early stages of that process. Both organisations are serving on the School Buildings Advisory Group, which also includes educationists, head teachers and designers. The DfES has recently published the results of Classroom of the Future, which used design and innovation to plot a series of responses to the changes in education environments we can expect over the next 10 years and beyond.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para52"></a>Perhaps most significantly, the Secretary of State is commissioning a series of exemplary primary school and secondary school designs, which will combine great architecture and urban design with a drive to maximise the benefits of off-site modular construction techniques. These exemplars will draw on the best <P>


<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>design talent in this country and beyond and will act as a resource for all LEAs and individual schools entering into a major building project.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para53"></a>I cannot match the breadth of aesthetic influence on the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, of his school days, but I was fortunate enough to attend Scotland Street school in Glasgow. Sadly, it was the only school ever built by the brilliant Charles Rennie Mackintosh and I wish I had taken my school desk away with me when I left.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para54"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, mentioned, the department has been funding an organisation called School Works to examine new ways of involving pupils and teachers in the design process. Its first active case study was the Kingsdale secondary school in Southwark, which has just achieved a 20 per cent increase in the number of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs at A to C grade level.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para55"></a>All this effort does not start just when children enter primary school. Among our most successful design initiatives have been Sure Start centres and Neighbourhood Nurseries. In both cases, we used national design competitions to set the standards of design at the outset of those initiatives.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para56"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, and the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, reminded us of the importance of educating an ever more creative generation of graduates. I trust that this debate will demonstrate to students of design the broad and strong support for their future role, as witnessed by the entertaining contributions of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para57"></a>On courts and prisons, the Lord Chancellor has pioneered new approaches to the design of court buildings. Again from the outset he has used CABE as a critical friend. He has also employed the internationally-renowned architect, Ian Ritchie, to set appropriately high standards for these landmark buildings.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para58"></a>At the same time, Ministers at the Home Office are working with the Design Council and the independent design organisation, the Do Tank, to rethink the design of prisons. The importance of that issue was highlighted by the noble Baroness, Lady Flather. As I learnt previously from the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, the cost of keeping a prisoner in gaol each year is twice the cost of Eton School's fees and six out of 10 ex-offenders are still returning to prison within two years. We have to work harder to incentivise those building and managing our prisons to design systems of detention which place greater emphasis on improving the future life chances of the prisoner, and reducing the probability of reoffence.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para59"></a>Of course, the role of design in the delivery of public services is not confined to the delivery of public buildings. In a few days' time, in another place, the Deputy Prime Minister will be publishing his Communities Plan which will set out how this Government intend to create neighbourhoods in different parts of the country which offer the better quality of life which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkham, rightly demands. We face two different problems: the <P>


<a name="column_1172"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to deliver additional housing in London and the South East; and the need to renew the housing stock in parts of northern England and the West Midlands. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, that the importance of design will be branded into the Communities Plan. Excellence in urban design will be essential in creating higher density mixed use neighbourhoods. This will require the skills of architects, landscapers and planners who will have among their concerns the needs of the elderly, as described by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para60"></a>The Deputy Prime Minister has already announced at the Urban Summit that CABE will be asked to set up a new unit, CABE space, to champion the design and management of public space, including parks, playgrounds, squares and streets. At present, over half of local authorities have no strategy for making the most out of their green spaces. It is not surprising, therefore, that 30 per cent of the population will not use our parks at all.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para61"></a>Part of the process is designing places that are safe. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently working with the Home Office, CABE and the police to revise the planning guidelines on designing out crime. Again, there are many empirical studies that show a clear relationship between good urban design and improved community safety. We need to use Secured by Design principles, including increasing natural surveillance and reducing rat-runs, to help local communities and the police deter criminal and other anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para62"></a>I hope that your Lordships will agree that this programme of activity demonstrates our commitment to raising our consciousness across Government when it comes to investment in quality design. But we cannot be complacent. I want to close by concentrating on what still remains to be done. Last year, we asked CABE and the Office of Government Commerce to review our design performance in the procurement of public buildings. The report of their review was published last October. The 11 recommendations they made have been accepted by every government department and by the National Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para63"></a>Let me add to the praise of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, and many others. I feel particularly privileged to speak in the same debate in which the noble Lord, Lord Foster of Thames Bank, makes his maiden speech. It was an outstanding contribution which I take to heart as a Minister. In a previous life, as chairman of the Scottish Media Group, I was fortunate enough to be a tenant in his wonderful ITN building in Gray's Inn Road; and before that as a journalist who once worked in the old newspaper building which stood on the site I congratulate him on the dramatic use he made of the depth of the old print room. As a former Transport Minister, I should say that if one wishes to travel on the Tube, go to Canary Wharf. The station, designed by the noble Lord, Lord Foster, is well worth the journey.

<a name="30129-06_para64"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, spoke of transport. I understand the problem with taxis. I see them also mutating into people carriers in many of the market places up and down the land. The noble Lord and I are both impressed by the advances made by London Transport with its low-floor buses, and so on&#151;despite the fact that it is at the expense of that splendid classic, the Routemaster, which is a splendid vehicle as long as one does not fall off the platform.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para65"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned noise barriers. On the transport side, I assure him that we are very conscious of the needs there. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, spoke persuasively of the changing needs of an ageing population, comments which should carry across Government. I listened with great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Gavron, and the experience with the Royal Opera House and its thoroughly enjoyable outcome.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para66"></a>In conclusion, I agree with the general thrust of the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, and other noble Lords who have spoken so persuasively from their wide experience of business. We all agree that we have extraordinary design talent in this country, arguably the best in the world. We are already reaping the benefits of that design talent in export receipts. It would be a missed opportunity if we were not to maximise the use of that talent in our drive to improve the quality of public services. We want the best designers and the best architects designing new public buildings and products. Our message to the private sector is quite simple. If you do not employ this design talent, you are reducing your chances of winning business from the Government. Once again, I commend the noble Lord, Lord Freyberg, on securing this debate and congratulate both the Design Council and CABE on their work to date. They enjoy our full support for the future.

<A NAME="30129-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Freyberg: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate all noble Lords who contributed their impressive and considerable expertise to the debate. I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foster, on his extremely informative and accomplished maiden speech, bringing to bear his enormous knowledge in this area. We all look forward to his future contributions on this and other matters.
<P>

<a name="30129-06_para67"></a>I know how seriously the Government take the question of design in public services. The fact that current measures are frequently not achieving the high standards is no reflection on their interest in the subject but evidence that there is no single, simple set of criteria which can be implemented. However, I hope that the Minister will agree with me when I say that it is well worth persevering to improve all aspects of design in the public sector and that when a high standard is achieved, even in just one project, rewards are enormous. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.

<A NAME="30129-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="30129-07_para0"></a>"I should like to make a Statement about the report of the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues and the report of the Review of the Regulatory Regime of the Accountancy Profession which my right honourable friend the Chancellor and I are publishing today. Copies of both reports have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para1"></a>"Last year the collapse of Enron, WorldCom and Andersens in the United States appalled investors all over the world. Millions of people saw their savings and pensions collapse.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para2"></a>"As I told the House last year,
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>'audit and accountancy standards in Britain are different from those in the United States: different and, as is now widely acknowledged, in some respects better'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-07_para3"></a>
So there was no need for the UK to rush into a Hewitt/Brown equivalent of the Sarbanes/Oxley Bill. But equally it would have been folly to sit back and say, 'It couldn't happen here'.
<P>
<UL>
<a name="30129-07_para4"></a>"Structures, standards and regulations can never be a complete defence against individuals determined to do wrong, nor can they wholly protect us against a culture of corporate greed and loose ethics. But we owe it to savers, investors and employees, as well as to all the honest business people whose reputation has been tarnished by these scandals, to ensure that our defences are as robust as they sensibly can be.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para5"></a>"The reforms I am announcing today, along with those proposed last week by Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith will raise standards of corporate governance&#151;I should emphasise that the reforms essentially cover only listed companies&#151;strengthen our accountancy and audit professions, and provide for a more effective system of regulating the profession. Together, they make up a complete package of reforms&#151;comprehensive and mutually reinforcing.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para6"></a>"First, I address the issue of boardrooms. Following Derek Higgs's proposals, the combined code on corporate governance will be strengthened to provide that at least half
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>"the board (as well as the chairman) should be independent&#151;as should all members of the audit and remuneration committees, and a majority of the nomination committee; the definition of an independent director should be strengthened and clarified; the separation of roles of chairman and chief executive should be reinforced; and new descriptions should be given of the respective roles of the board, the chairman and non-executives.

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>personal contacts and friendships. I welcome his proposals to promote meritocracy through an open, fair and rigorous appointments process. As part of the follow-up, a group led by Laura Tyson of London Business School will look at ways of bringing candidates from the non-commercial sector to greater prominence&#151;including women&#151;and will report to me in May.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para9"></a>"In revising the combined code, the Financial Reporting Council will also implement the recommendations of Sir Robert Smith's group that the audit committee should consist entirely of independent members, with at least one having relevant financial experience; monitor the auditor's performance, especially on independence and objectivity; and develop and implement policy on the purchase of non-audit services from the auditor, with reference to tough new ethical guidance.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para10"></a>"Following well established practice, listed companies will be required either to comply with these provisions or to explain to their shareholders why they are not doing so.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para11"></a>"The second aspect of our reforms concerns tougher measures to underpin auditor independence. Following the recommendations of the co-ordinating group, I can announce that, as well as an enhanced role for audit committees and a tightening up of the provision of non-audit services by auditors, the professional bodies have already changed their regulations so that the lead audit partner has to be rotated within five years; partners and senior employees of audit firms will not be able to take up employment with a company they audit within two years of leaving their audit firm; and most of the UK's large audit firms have already agreed to publish an annual report, provide management and financial information, and reveal levels of dependency on single clients, including how the firm handles conflicts of interest and interdependence issues. I believe that that third aspect will work on a voluntary basis. If not, we will make such disclosures a condition of auditing listed companies.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para12"></a>"I am also calling for the standards and ethical guidance for auditors on the provision of non-audit services to be toughened up further.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para13"></a>"We will also strengthen enforcement of accounting standards. At the moment, the Financial Reporting Review Panel only steps in if particular concerns are raised with it. But the co-ordinating group recommends, and we agree, that enforcement of these standards must be proactive. From now on, the Financial Services Authority will help the Financial Reporting Review Panel on enforcement&#151;particularly in identifying the high-risk cases which most merit investigation. The FSA and panel will need to agree as soon as possible a memorandum of understanding to clarify their precise roles and responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para14"></a>"These measures will be underpinned by the third element of our reforms&#151;more effective regulation of the professions. The Financial Reporting Council will assume the functions of the Accountancy <P>

<P>

<a name="30129-07_para15"></a>"The Financial Reporting Council, under Sir Bryan Nicholson, has developed an excellent reputation. The Accountancy Foundation, chaired by Lord Borrie, has also done valuable work, for which I thank it. The new combined body will build on these achievements.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para16"></a>"After wide consultation, the DTI's review team recommend, and again I agree:
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para17"></a>"First, the Auditing Practices Board should take over from the professional bodies responsibility for setting standards for independence, objectivity and integrity. Oversight of other ethical standards will become the responsibility of a new professional oversight board. The Ethics Standard Board will be wound up in due course. I have greatly appreciated the work which its chairman, Christopher Jonas, and his colleagues have done to take forward the ethical agenda and to provide the basis for the new board's work;
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para18"></a>"Secondly, a new independent inspection unit, located within the FRC, should take over from the professional bodies responsibility for monitoring audits of listed companies, major charities and pension funds, and;
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para19"></a>"Thirdly, the long delayed Investigation and Discipline Board should come into operation quickly to provide a truly independent forum for hearing significant public interest disciplinary cases.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para20"></a>"It is vital for the new structure to have clarity of accountability and responsibility, together with the appropriate powers, to operate effectively in the public interest. There is a strong case for statutory underpinning to make the new body work. We will consider that further and report our conclusions to the House.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para21"></a>"The proposals that I have outlined today are substantial and mean significant changes to the way companies and their auditors carry out their work. This package must be implemented as quickly as possible. Changes to the regulatory structure will be taken forward immediately. The DTI will lead an implementation steering group on which Sir Bryan Nicholson, Lord Borrie and Peter Wyman, president of the ICAEW, have kindly agreed to serve.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para22"></a>"An FRC with enhanced responsibilities will require more investment. The Government will pay their share of core running costs, but I also expect companies from the profession to contribute. It is in all our interests to make these changes work&#151;and it is fair that we all pay for the improvements. Changes to the combined code arising from the Higgs and Smith reports will be made in the early summer once the FRC has consulted on the precise wording. All these measures will be taken forward alongside the <P>

<P>

<a name="30129-07_para23"></a>"These proposals are not a response to short-term market movements. They are about strengthening the foundations of our capital markets for the long term. I want in particular to thank Derek Higgs and Sir Robert and his group for their excellent reports, as well as all those who participated in the co-ordinating group under the joint chairmanship of my honourable friends the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. I also want to pay tribute to the officials who so swiftly took forward the review of the regulatory regime.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para24"></a>"The overall package is tough where that is needed, but measured and proportionate throughout.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. Bearing the public matter in mind, I begin by declaring an interest as a non-executive or independent director of two listed companies and a mutual building society.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para25"></a>On these Benches, we welcome measures designed to reduce the possibilities of fraudulent activity. Trust is a vital ingredient in financial markets, giving confidence to those who wish to save, especially over the long term. However, it is a bit rich for the Government to claim that the proposals are not a reaction to short-term market movements, for that is precisely what they are, and the Government are being disingenuous to pretend otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para26"></a>We welcome the Government's attempts to try to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance by applying the new standards to what the Statement describes as "essentially only . . . listed companies". However, it would be helpful if the Minister can explain what is meant by the word "essentially". It is potentially a weasel word. Either they apply to listed companies exclusively, or they do not. Secondly, do the new standards apply to AIM listed companies, which are listed on the alternative investment market? Thirdly, do they apply to foreign companies listed on the London Stock Exchange? If so, how will they be enforced? If not, how will potential investors in those companies be aware of the greater risk that they are running?
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para27"></a>Finally, are the Government aware of the huge range of listed companies&#151;multi-billion, multinational companies at one end of the spectrum and the £50 million capitalised local engineering company at the other? For the latter to have over half its board made up of independent directors will be quite a challenge. Could thought be given&#151;or has it <P>


<a name="column_1178"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been given&#151;to focusing the new rules so that they fall most heavily on larger companies, say those listed in the FTSE 100 or the FTSE 250 index?
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para28"></a>As I say, these new rules are the by-product of fraudulent activity but we must always be careful to distinguish between fraud and risk. Too often people are inclined to view fraud as their risk that went wrong. In the previous debate mention was made of the importance to UK plc of design. But UK plc also needs risk takers. Risk takers need freedom to manage and a competitive base from which to run their businesses. The new rules will undoubtedly represent another regulatory and cost burden. We understand why they are being introduced but will the Government undertake a study of the cumulative effect of the increasing regulatory burden on UK businesses' world competitive position?
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para29"></a>Will the Minister also clarify the chain of command in the new structure? We have, as I understand it, the Financial Reporting Council, which will take over the Accountancy Foundation. We have a new professional oversight board taking over the Ethics Standards Board. We have a proposed independent inspection unit and a new investigation and discipline board. We have an implementation steering group and a financial reporting and review board. Circling over all that we have the Financial Services Authority, the Department of Trade and Industry and, last but not least, Professor Laura Tyson. How will we ensure that there is no duplication of effort and of cost?
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para30"></a>It is very welcome that the Statement repeats the importance of separating the roles of chairman and chief executive. In those circumstances it is an even greater shame that the Government do not follow their own precepts and that it took enormous pressure in your Lordships' House to persuade them to split the roles of the chairman and chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading in the Enterprise Bill. I invite the Minister to take this opportunity to announce that the Government will forthwith split the roles of chairman and chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, particularly given the FSA's important role in enforcing the new proposals announced today.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para31"></a>Finally, it goes without saying that we on these Benches find any form of fraud unacceptable. Fraud enables the greedy to prey upon the weak and the unsophisticated. We therefore give a broad welcome to the proposals. But before more legislation is put on the statute book, if legislation is required, we need to have an informed public debate as to how effective the detailed proposals will be in the real world.

<A NAME="30129-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, in thanking the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. It seems to me that your Lordships' House is exactly the place where detailed comments on such a Statement can be made. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, mentioned some important issues. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, particularly with regard to the FSA, without wishing to intrude on past private grief.
<P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para32"></a>As the Minister rightly said, the Statement brings together three reports raising different issues that are relevant to corporate governance in the UK. First, I refer to the Higgs proposals on conduct in boardrooms and the way in which listed companies should conduct themselves. It is not for me to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, but it is fair to say that the Derek Higgs report makes clear that he proposes applying the most onerous requirements on the leading 350 listed companies. There is a section in the report in which he recognises that the smaller listed companies will not be able to comply&#151;certainly not immediately&#151;with the more onerous requirements. I believe that the Minister with his business experience would be the first to agree that the Higgs report is at the very soft end of what might have emerged in relation to corporate governance. I am sure that some of the Minister's noble friends, who are not present today but are often present at Question Time, will consider that the Higgs proposals do not go as far as they would wish.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para33"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, made an important point with regard to small listed companies. I refer to a fundamental concern&#151;I hope that the Minister will give his views on the matter&#151;namely, from where will the people come to provide the non-executive directors that the Higgs report requires? Looking around your Lordships' House I see a number of noble Lords and noble Baronesses who sit on boards of directors as non-executive directors. Given the current state of liability, I am not sure that any of them would readily take on a new post as a non-executive director. We are not talking here about people who are effectively seconded from major companies to sit on those boards. Although the Higgs report wishes to increase vastly the pool of non-executive directors its recommendations will restrict the number of executive directors who can take up non-executive appointments in other companies. I should welcome hearing the Minister's comments, not only his comments as a Minister but also those arising from his own practical business experience, in regard to where all these non-executive directors will come from.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para34"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, indicated that the essence of the Higgs recommendations is that this matter should not be a case of "one-size-fits-all". I cannot let the moment pass without commenting that Mr Higgs himself sits on the board of directors of British Land but has so far been unable to persuade the chairman and chief executive to stand down from one of those positions. That situation is rather ironic. I believe that a similar irony arose in the Greenbury report that was issued years ago.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para35"></a>I turn to the recommendations regarding the accountancy profession. I believe that those measures are at the soft end of recommendations compared with some ideas that have been floated. For example, there is no recommendation that there should be any form of statutory split between audit and non-audit work. Noble Lords who follow these matters are well aware that that is a major issue both in Europe and in the UK. I should also welcome hearing the Minister's <P>


<a name="column_1180"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>views on whether the trend towards separation of audit and non-audit work will continue and whether the Government will support that.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para36"></a>What views does the Minister hold on an idea that my noble friend Lord Sharman has floated on a number of occasions as former chairman of KPMG; that is, that the National Audit Office should be allowed to compete in the private sector for big company audits? We believe that the National Audit Office would be keen to do that and that it could develop a degree of audit expertise which would be outside that of the big four which dominate the FTSE 100 companies. In the case of the National Audit Office there would obviously not be the problem of wanting to compete for non-audit work.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para37"></a>I turn to the alteration of the position of the regulators. I draw noble Lords' attention to the sentence on page 7 of the Statement which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a strong case for statutory underpinning to make the new body work".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-07_para38"></a>
 I hope that the Minister will comment further on that sentence. I should have thought that what the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a strong case for statutory underpinning to make the new body work",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-07_para39"></a>
actually mean is, subject to negotiation to get it into the Queen's Speech, there will be statutory underpinning to make the new body work. I hope that the Minister will develop that point.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para40"></a>In conclusion, I take up the sentence where the Government say that the proposals are substantial and
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"mean significant changes to the way companies and their auditors carry out their work".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-07_para41"></a>
I would consider that as going a little far. These proposals will only mean what the quotation states if the voluntary provisions recommended here are actually complied with by companies and auditors. Is the Minister prepared to be drawn on what action the Government will take if it transpires that many of these recommendations are not adopted in practice by companies and auditors? In those circumstances do the Government propose to legislate?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal first with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. He said that these measures were a response to short-term market movements. Given that they have spent a long period in gestation, I do not believe that we can say that they are such a response. It can be fairly said that they were a response to events which took place in America. It seems to me wholly right that where we have that situation in America, which was outlined at the beginning of the Statement, action should be taken because of it. If we had not taken action, I believe that the noble Lord would have said with some justification that we were in danger of being complacent. I do not believe that that is the same as making a response to short-term market movements.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para42"></a>As regards to whom it applies, we very carefully said that it applied to "essentially" listed companies. That was not the use of a weasel word, but to be strictly accurate about the situation. It is a whole package of <P>


<a name="column_1181"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposals. The Co-ordinating Group on Accounting and Audit alone has 27 recommendations. What we mean by "essentially" is that the vast majority apply only to listed companies; for example, a measure such as a pro-active enforcement of accounting standards will apply beyond purely listed companies and in fact to some large private companies. It was for that reason that we did not want to say misleadingly that all the measures applied only to listed companies.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para43"></a>We have not taken the view that one size fits all. In many cases we are saying that there will be a model and that companies, through the listing agreement, will either have to go along with that or explain to the market why that is not being done. It will be the market's judgment on the matter. That is the wholly appropriate way to proceed.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para44"></a>I do not believe that there is a great deal of extra regulatory burden although some of those burdens may be different because they require people to do different things. That is not the same as increasing the regulatory burden.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para45"></a>As regards the new bodies, there is equally a reduction in their numbers. For the new arrangements for the Financial Reporting Council it can be fairly said, having looked at the pages where the Accountancy Foundation is set out, that we are simplifying and probably cutting down the number of bodies involved.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para46"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asked where the non-executive directors are to come from. There are substantial sources from which people can come. The Laura Tyson taskforce will look at how we can increase the number coming from outside the corporate world. Within it there are executive directors of other companies where it is regarded as good for their development that they should be non-executive directors of other companies. That source could be drawn on much more in future.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para47"></a> As regards the separation of audit and non-audit work, the co-ordinating group considered various approaches to the problem of auditing independence. I believe that an outright ban would be the most extreme response. The co-ordinating group recommends against it and we very much agree. The UK approach is based on key principles and safeguards, not on lists of banned activities. If no adequate safeguards can be implemented then the auditor must not carry out the work. But the thrust of the matter is that each situation must be judged on its merits against the overall standards. That is why the role of the audit committee is so crucial.
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para48"></a>As regards the statutory underpinning of the Financial Reporting Council, the noble Lord is right. We shall consult on that as to exactly which parts of that council should be underpinned statutorily. We do not believe that it is necessary that all its activities should be. There are some quite fine judgments involved in that. We shall consult on it and return to the House on the matter.
<P>


<a name="column_1182"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-07_para49"></a>As I said at the beginning, a great deal depends on voluntary action in some cases, but in many others it is underpinned by the fact that a listing agreement will require companies to explain why they do not take the necessary action. In that event there will be a market judgment and in others there will be new statutory underpinning. I believe that the total package gets the balance right in terms of taking firm action, but proportionately.

<A NAME="30129-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, do these measures apply to AIM companies and what is the position of foreign companies listed on the London Stock Exchange? I do not believe I had a response to those two matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, may I come back to the noble Lord on those matters? As I said, there are very many issues here which apply in different ways. I shall write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, I am not a director now, but I have been in the past. I am concerned about the role of non-executive directors. Some years ago a Permanent Secretary at the Department of Trade, having retired, was offered a non-executive directorship at one of the largest of the listed companies in this country. Nothing happened and he wondered why. He was told that the chairman had said that he would not have him because he would ask too many awkward questions.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para0"></a>When someone as competent as that&#151;and he was an outstanding Permanent Secretary&#151;receives that kind of reaction, it makes one worry about the kind of situation he was likely to have entered into. There is a need to strengthen the independence of a number of the non-executive directors. I would welcome that.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para1"></a>The legislation is obviously going to be very complex. Can my noble friend say anything about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the independence of non-executive directors is a very important question. In order to protect my back, I take it absolutely sine qua non that a Permanent Secretary would be an excellent addition to any board. That is obviously unarguable. The Higgs report is about giving a much stronger position to the non-executive directors and much clearer independence. But in answer to the noble Lord's question, it is also a process by which they are chosen not on the whim of a chairman but through due process, which will widen the selection and make it more transparent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williamson of Horton: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a hard-working, non-executive independent director of Whitbread PLC and a member of its audit committee for a long time.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para2"></a>While I very much welcome what the Minister has said about non-audit services provided by audit firms, we need to be extremely careful about it. I agree with <P>


<a name="column_1183"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, that the proof of the pudding is in the eating because it is a voluntary system although it underpins the listing requirements. We need to give a lot of attention to this matter.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para3"></a>Does the Minister agree that with the many reports which we have had on governance, including the Higgs report, we have to be careful not to get ourselves into a position where we believe that every recommendation is automatically right. Some of the recommendations can be legitimately challenged on grounds of efficiency and how business should be conducted. For example, should a senior non-executive member of a board be appointed so that he can have further contact with shareholders? There are other ways to do that, and it is important not to get ourselves into the position of thinking that everything in a report must be adopted automatically. Some things can be done better in other ways.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Baroness would like to answer the question, I am more than happy for her to do so. She is probably more qualified.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para4"></a>Much of the Statement meshes together. As important as distinctions between audit and non-audit work are, that question is in the context of the Smith report and its strengthening of the audit committee. The committee will have the say on the matter. That its independence has been greatly strengthened by the Smith report is very relevant.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para5"></a>We did not say that we would accept every recommendation of the Higgs report, but we looked at it carefully. It is an excellent report. We are impressed with the recommendations and will take them forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for jumping the gun. My eagerness on the subject overcame me. I declare a couple of interests as a non-executive director of listed companies, a member of audit committees and a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, although fortunately no longer an office holder.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para6"></a>I start by asking the Minister about costs. The Statement says that there will need to be more investment in the new regulatory arrangements and that the Government will pay their share. However, it is silent on how much those costs will be and how much the Government are prepared to contribute. I assume that they have not signed a blank cheque on that. Will he give us some more information?
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para7"></a>Related to that is the impact of all the changes on audit costs. Is the Minister aware that audit firms in the US are talking about audit costs rising a minimum of 25 per cent, and often much more, to deal with the equivalent regulatory changes there? Do we think that there will be a similar impact on costs in particular? Have the Government thought about the impact of costs not on the larger plcs, but at the smaller end of the scale, which is the engine room of growth?
<P>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para8"></a>Finally, will the Minister say what the Government have achieved, if anything, in ameliorating the impact of Sarbanes/Oxley on dual-listed companies that have their main listing in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I cannot say much more about the costs of the Financial Reporting Council, including the foundation of functions. Clearly, we will try to proceed in the most cost-effective way, and the FRC will consult contributors, the Government, industry and the profession on firm budgetary estimates of its running costs. We think that the FRC's core annual running costs should be broadly shared by the Government, business and the profession, with two exceptions. The cost of cases heard by the investigation and discipline board should fall to the professional bodies concerned, and the cost of inspection by the independent audit inspection unit should be met by the audit firms. In both cases, that reflects the current position.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para9"></a> In terms of the impact on audit costs, one needs to keep a firm view on the end objective of the whole process, which is to make certain that company accounts are trusted by investors of all kinds. If that does not take place, we are in a serious situation in terms of the functioning of the capital markets. If that involves some extra expenditure but leads to trust in accounts, that would be money well spent.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para10"></a>The SEC is showing a welcome sensitivity to foreign concerns and to some issues arising from Sarbanes/Oxley on corporate governance, non-audit services and rotation of audit partners, in response to the pressure from the UK and the European Commission. We pointed out that sometimes the regulations do not turn out well, and there is sensitivity to some of those issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the Minister for missing the first moments of his Statement.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para11"></a>Bearing in mind that the curse of many disciplinary tribunals is delay, does the Minister support the hope and expectation that the investigation and discipline board will be expected to create protocols that enable it to act quickly? Also, does he support the hope that it will have interlocutory powers and, where there are criminal investigations&#151;such as by the Serious Fraud Office, which can be long delayed&#151;disciplinary proceedings will not necessarily have to await the conclusion of criminal investigations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, if I may say so, that is slightly jumping the gun in terms of where we have got to on the process. All the points that the noble Lord has made are in principle highly desirable but, in terms of where we have got to, I would jump the gun if I assured the House that all that would definitely take place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a non-executive director of three companies&#151;one listed, one mutual and one large private company.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para12"></a>The Minister made no mention of mutuals, at least two of which, Standard Life and Nationwide, would probably fall into the FTSE 100 if they were listed. Would the proposals affect the mutual sector as well? The Minister mentioned large charities. Is there a definition of a large charity?
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para13"></a>My third question relates to Europe. None of us should ignore the fact that as we sit on our varying boards we not only have to cope with the FSA and its continuing consultation documents but increasingly have to take into view what is happening in Europe. Can we have confidence that Her Majesty's Government will not produce recommendations that then have to be amended two years on because of data or instructions coming out of Europe that we should have known about already?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-08_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, on the first question I would have to say what I said originally. What we have been talking about is an enormous and substantial package of proposals. They apply in different ways to different kinds of organisation. I cannot give a simple answer for mutuals or anything else without going through all the proposals and saying how they would impact on them.
<P>

<a name="30129-08_para14"></a>So far as international standards are concerned, a lot of work is now taking place to make it certain that UK accounting standards are brought in line with international standards. In the world in which we live, that is clearly of increasing importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister say a little more about the range of expertise that may be available for non-executive directorships? I speak as one who has held no more than three at any one time. That is presumably within the remit of the Higgs report. It was commented that there would be a serious dearth of suitable candidates. Not even thinking of the vast number of suitably qualified women who could do the job, what about the range of academics, lawyers and heads of Civil Service departments? Surely a huge range of suitably qualified people could help to make up the 50 per cent suggested by Derek Higgs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I refer to what the Secretary of State said in the Statement, which was that Professor Laura Tyson of the London Business School would look at ways to bring candidates from the non-commercial sector to greater prominence, including women, and would report in May. That is on the basis that the Secretary of State and I have considerable confidence that an enormous pool of talent is waiting to be drawn on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as an audit client for 18 years, as a tax client for 40 years with Arthur Andersen and as a continuing tax client of its successor, Deloitte & Touche Private Clients. The first tax partner who looked after my affairs, who is now sadly dead, always prefaced complicated ideas by saying that I would <P>


<a name="column_1186"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have already considered and rejected the suggestion that he was about to make but he thought it was worth a second look. Leaving aside the over-kindness of the preface that I have mentioned, can the Minister enlarge on the answer that he gave to my noble friend Lady Noakes about how the understanding of these matters among the amateur investing public can be improved, so that after recent events they do not unnecessarily shun the Stock Exchange?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, that is an extremely difficult question. To convey to the average investor the range of regulations that already exist and the further action that we are taking would be a considerable task. I hope that as these measures are put into place, the average investor will increasingly become aware of the action that is being taken and will realise that we are in no way complacent about the situation, despite the fact that in comparison with the United States, we have had comparatively few incidents of serious mis-statements of company accounts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, I asked the Minister three questions, the third of which was: what was the definition of a large charity? That was mentioned in the Statement that he repeated. Is there such a definition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is such a definition. We were simply pointing out that large charities&#151;without specifying what they were&#151;would come into that same category.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Warnock </B>   rose to call attention to the case for rethinking the provision of special education; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this Motion, I must declare two interests: I was chairman of the government committee of inquiry many years ago into the education of children with special needs, which reported in 1978 and which was followed by the Education Act 1981; and I am currently president of the British Dyslexia Association.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para1"></a>There are several reasons why I wish to raise this question now. The main reason is the publication last year of two Audit Commission reports. The first, which was published in June, was entitled, Statutory assessment and statements of SEN: In need of review?. The second, which was published in November, was entitled, Special educational needs: A mainstream issue. In the second appendix to the latter report (on page 60) the commission refers to the public response to a recommendation in the June report that the Government should,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"establish a high-level independent review to consider options for future reform".

<a name="column_1187"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Eighty per cent of those consulted were apparently in favour of the proposal and 60 per cent were strongly in favour. Those who were most supportive were local education authorities, health and social services departments and teachers. Those groups feel that the present framework of provision gives rise to the greatest lack of clarity and variation in standards of provision up and down the country. I want to point to a few of the areas in which that lack of clarity is damaging.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para3"></a>The last such general inquiry took place in 1974&#150;78; after that, as I said, the framework was laid down in legislation in 1981 within which provision is still made, although there have been numerous changes in detail. The framework is as follows. Special educational needs may be identified either at birth or soon thereafter by medical or social services. In principle, education can begin at two years of age, although that is not very common. However, the increase in nursery provision under the present Government has made earlier identification of needs much more likely. That is a matter of great satisfaction. Thereafter, assessment may follow at various stages, leading to extra support for individual children in mainstream schools wherever possible. In the case of a proportion of children so assessed, a statement of needs will be issued by the local authority laying down what the local authority is bound by statute to provide to meet the child's needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para4"></a>It is largely in the matter of these statements that things have gone wrong in my view and a disastrous lack of clarity has increasingly emerged. In its briefing for this debate, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be folly to alter the framework around statementing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-09_para5"></a>
In so far as I understand that, I profoundly disagree with it.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para6"></a>Among the difficulties with statements are these: there is an enormous difference between local authorities as to how many children are issued with statements; as the local authority has a mandatory duty only to "statemented" children to provide what they need, parents have come to feel that only if a child has a statement will any extra provision be forthcoming; and some local authorities even wait for parents to demand a statement before they consider assessing the child to establish whether he needs one. The result is that parents are increasingly demanding that a child be assessed and a statement issued.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para7"></a>For example, in Birmingham, parents are in conflict with the council on the grounds that their children are not automatically assessed or reassessed when they move on to secondary school. Appeals by parents of children with special educational needs are now increasing faster than at any time since 1997. The appeals are because the local education authority has refused to issue a statement; because what is mentioned in it as needed by the child is not being provided; or because parents&#151;very reasonably, I believe&#151;suspect that the only provision that is identified in the statement is that which the local education authority believes it can afford. It has more to do with what is affordable than with what is needed.
<P>


<a name="column_1188"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para8"></a>More than 3,000 parents lodged appeals during 2001&#150;02, which was an increase of 11 per cent over the previous year; the figures continue to rise. This appears to me to be a frightful waste of resources. Such resources should properly be spent perhaps most importantly on the training of teachers to recognise, take account of and seek help for children in mainstream schools who have special needs; they could also be used for the provision of more classroom assistants. Those assistants are absolutely essential if differentiation within the classroom to take account of children's special needs is going to be widespread. Moreover, an atmosphere of conflict and anger is not a good background for the provision of what is best for the child.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para9"></a>Long ago&#151;in the 1970s&#151;we hoped that there would be a partnership between parents and local authorities. In those days, of course, local authorities had far more powers, they knew their children far better than they do now and the situation was radically different. Confrontational litigation and appeals tribunals, which are the opposite of partnership, are proliferating.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para10"></a>Another problem is that there is enormous confusion within schools and among parents about how the provision of special educational needs is to be resourced&#151;whether for children with statements or those identified as having special needs but without statements. This is made more difficult by the number of resources allocated to schools to dispose of at their judgment. There is little incentive for schools to spend money out of their regular resources on children with special educational needs. Worst of all, there is little incentive for mainstream schools to admit children identified with special educational needs. That is another great source of conflict with parents, who cannot get their children into their first choice school.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para11"></a>The help that schools are supposed to receive from social services and the National Health Service&#151;especially for speech therapy, which is one of the most important areas of help for children with special needs&#151;is often not forthcoming. There is confusion here: although a local education authority may place on the statement that a child needs a certain number of hours of speech therapy per year, it is subject to how much the National Health Service in that area can afford. So there is no reason to suppose in the present circumstances that a child will receive the speech therapy he or she needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para12"></a>I strongly believe that the interests of the most severely disabled children must be safeguarded. They must be offered the possibility of education in special schools, if such schools are most able to cope with their multiple and complicated disabilities. Some in particular should be allowed the chance to be educated at boarding schools, which are often the best, most secure, supportive and effective means of educating, providing 24-hour education.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para13"></a> Having said that, the unclear and increasingly controversial division between those with and without statements no longer acts as a proper safeguard. Some other safeguard for these most vulnerable children <P>


<a name="column_1189"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>needs to be devised. It leaves those who do not have statements liable to receive little help. A large number of children identified as having special needs have hardly an hour per day's help from a classroom assistant in a mainstream class.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para14"></a>Although the framework within which needs are assessed and met has remained the same for more than 20 years, our concept of educational needs has radically changed, especially since 1997. In the 1970s it was only recently that the most severely disabled children had been brought under the wing of the Department of Education. Hitherto, they were considered uneducable. We on the committee all those years ago decided to change people's view of educational needs and to make them recognise the continuum of needs, at one end of which were children in mainstream schools with needs that could readily be met with a little more help; and at the other of which were children with multiple, severe and permanent disabilities. It was for those children that we invented the concept&#151;I now think it was a mistaken concept&#151;of the statement.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para15"></a>We envisaged that those children needed help and an assurance that they would not be overlooked again. We envisaged them as 2 per cent of all children of school age. Now it is difficult to obtain reliable statistics of the relation between the number of children with statements and the number assessed as having special needs who do not have statements. It is almost impossible to discover how such children are doing at school. We need a method of monitoring the progress of children who either do not take the key stage tests, or, if they do, automatically fail.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para16"></a>I want to explain what I meant when I said the concept of educational needs had radically changed. When the committee was set up, we were given two warnings: first, that we were not to deem that a child had a special educational need on the grounds that his first language was not English&#151;technically at the time the Home Office was supposed to finance the teaching of English as a second language. Secondly, we were told that we must not deem a child to have special educational needs on account of poverty or other deprivation.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para17"></a>I am happy to say that such limitations on the concept of needs now seem ridiculous. We know that by far the largest number of children with special needs and those who most urgently need help to communicate, to enjoy work and play and to progress are those living in poverty; those with abusive or dysfunctional families; and those in care. We know that by nearly any criterion of need there are whole schools within which almost every child has a special need.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para18"></a>That is why I have begun to wonder whether the framework of the 1981 Act has outlived its usefulness. Since 1981, there has been a considerable body of legislation regarding children and their rights. I am not certain that the way in which children with special needs are treated in mainstream schools is always in conformity with this legislation. It will be interesting to hear what becomes of the Bill proposed in Scotland, <P>


<a name="column_1190"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>which was published last Friday, which seeks to remove the duty of recording&#151;which is equivalent to our statement.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para19"></a>I believe it is more appropriate to start again with what I know is the Government's interest, which is to educate all children, however unhopeful their beginning, and to concentrate on resourcing the schools where many of those children are and not to think of them as a race apart. I beg to move for Papers.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for introducing the important subject of special education. I will focus on the special educational needs of children with autism, and in doing so declare an interest as the father of an autistic daughter.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para20"></a>The Government are driving the push towards "inclusion". However, the emerging picture nationally is that for many vulnerable children that does not work. Indeed, autistic children and their needs are identified by most mainstream schools as the single issue for which they have the greatest difficulty catering.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para21"></a>Mainstream education failed my daughter totally. We battled it out for four years, the last two amounting to nothing more than childcare. The education provided, and the totally inadequate support, were quite unable to meet her needs. Unfortunately, my daughter's case as a mainstream failure is typical.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para22"></a> The National Autistic Society's recent survey of schools found that one in 86 children has special educational needs related to an autism spectrum disorder. The schools also reported that one in every 152 children had a formal diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Ongoing research in 366 schools in England and Wales suggests that 17 per cent of all statements mention autism or Asperger syndrome. Through its Advocacy for Education service, the NAS hears from thousands of parents who are deeply dissatisfied with the educational provision that their child is receiving. Across all age ranges, and in every type of provision, parents run into conflicts with schools and LEAs in their attempts to identify and meet the needs of their child with autism. This struggle to access appropriate education provision is reflected in the number of cases related to autism registered with the SEN tribunal. Last year there was an increase of 22 per cent of cases registered. It is unacceptable that parents should have to battle for what is every child's fundamental right. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that this is a complete and utter waste of resources.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para23"></a>As the noble Baroness mentioned, last year the Audit Commission published Special educational needs: A mainstream issue, which looks at how well our system is serving children with SEN. I welcome this review as the current system is failing many children with autism who have SEN. However, my understanding of the problems posed by the current system and potential avenues for improvement, differs from the blueprint set out in the Audit Commission <P>


<a name="column_1191"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>report. I would welcome improvements to the current assessment and statementing procedures, but reject the Audit Commission's conclusions that statements add little value, provide little assurance to parents, lead to an inequitable distribution of resources and are inconsistent with inclusion. Without statements, parents, who are not satisfied with their child's SEN provision, would have no practical legal redress.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para24"></a>My concern over the current statementing and assessment process is that there is no statutory body to regulate local education authorities. At the moment, parental vigilance is the only means of monitoring the implementation of a statement of special educational needs. This is compounded by the fact that local education authorities act as gatekeepers to the actual assessment process in the first place. Often parents do not know their rights and are, unsurprisingly, unable to cope with the complexities of the process without support.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para25"></a>I ask the noble Baroness what mechanisms can be put in place to give parents access to quick and easy forms of redress when statutory bodies fail to deliver on their SEN duties. How can the current variations in assessment and statementing practice be removed to end the postcode lottery of SEN provision? Although the statementing system is not working as it should, many parents of children with SEN are desperate to get a statement for their child as it is the only means of ensuring that they receive support in mainstream.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para26"></a>There are three fundamental problems with the current statutory assessment and statementing process. First, there is a gap between identified levels of need and current human and financial resource availability. Secondly, there is the failure of LEAs to act according to current law and guidance. Thirdly, there is the lack of any mechanism to ensure that LEAs implement statements. Those three points must be addressed to ensure that children with SEN access the education they need and deserve.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para27"></a>I do not agree with the Audit Commission's view that reducing the number of statements issued by LEAs would improve the current situation. The sole purpose of the current statutory assessment and statementing process is to determine the appropriate provision to meet the needs of all children with SEN. I believe that the motivation for parents to fight for an assessment comes from a deep dissatisfaction with the level of provision available from a school's SEN budget. As many LEAs are already delegating much of their SEN funding to schools, it seems unlikely that further delegation will lead to provision that will satisfy parents and will be appropriate for children with high-level and complex needs. Instead, assessment and statementing should be modified with the intention of putting into practice the current law and guidance designed to ensure appropriate provision for all children with SEN.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para28"></a>At no point does the Audit Commission ask whether we are spending enough on SEN nationally. There are several indications that we are not. The average lifetime cost resulting from autism and associated learning disabilities is estimated to be £3 million. That <P>


<a name="column_1192"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a staggering figure. Only 7 per cent of that sum is spent on education. Evidence suggests that even slight increases in educational provision could result in major savings in later living costs. In my own county, Kent, with a funding gap of £3.7 million as a result of the Government switching resources to Labour core areas, the education budget will have to be cut dramatically.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para29"></a>Whether they are in mainstream or special schools, children with autism and Asperger syndrome need to be taught in an environment that is autism-aware and responsive to the needs of individual children. Regardless of whether the underlying rate is increasing, there are more children with autism in English and Welsh schools than ever previously reported. Resources must be found to meet the needs of those children if the policy of inclusion is to work.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para30"></a>What can be done to improve the recruitment and retention rates of specialist SEN professionals, particularly speech and language therapists, to increase the likelihood that assessed provision will actually be delivered? The noble Baroness rightly pointed out the vital role of speech therapists. Many teachers do not feel that they know enough about autism. Therefore LEAs should plan to train all teachers, assistants and specialist professionals in awareness and understanding of autism as part of the accessibility planning duty introduced by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. The Teacher Training Agency should include modules in basic teacher training on how to meet the needs of children with autism spectrum disorders. The excellent document, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Good Practice Guidance, issued jointly by the DfES and the DoH, provides practical advice on teaching children with autism. I urge the Government to send a copy to every school in the UK.

<A NAME="30129-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for opening the debate, and for having the courage to prick the bubble of defence that has built up around the idea of statements. Virtually everyone who has been involved in these matters for any length of time see statements as a shield and support. Should we get rid of them because there is something better, or are they still the only show in town? That is the question that comes out of this debate. Whether they should or should not be the only option is another question. I believe that we should have an alternative, but at present there is not another way forward&#151;at least not from here. I am reminded of the story about asking directions in Ireland and being told, "Well, I wouldn't start from here if I were you".
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para31"></a>The awareness of autism and autism spectrum disorder reminds me of dyslexia 20 years ago. People are suddenly discovering it. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Astor, will not take this badly when I say that it is the sexy disability of the moment in education. It is a disorder that we are just discovering. Many of the cases that people are discovering and going through may be fairly mild, but I am not sure whether there are stories about autism spectrum disorders with people <P>


<a name="column_1193"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>saying, "Oh, I knew someone who used to be autistic but he got over it", as I hear about dyslexia. Such people fail to comprehend what a disability is. They do not understand what is involved in the coping strategies, in learning and in getting through the problems. But I am sure that it will happen eventually. It is a little like, in fashion terms, the second run of flares: they have a slightly different cut but basically the same process is going on. People are discovering something new.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para32"></a>Against that background and against the expansion that took place, the statementing process, which finally gave people a way to say, "We need something to protect our educational needs and requirements", was vitally important. I do not believe that we have gone far enough into the process to be able to drop statementing yet, if we ever do.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para33"></a>The words of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will be listened to with even greater interest than normal on this occasion as the statementing process was so much part of her drive. I believe that we should think long and hard before we drop statementing as it provides protection for the individual.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para34"></a>Reading the Audit Commission report reminded me of everything that I had ever heard was wrong with the education system in relation to special educational needs over many years. We are told: there is more awareness of the problems; there is not sufficient initial teacher training; there is not sufficient in-service training; it is better than it was; or, it is nowhere near good enough; and so on. That was the impression that I gained from the report.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para35"></a>Also, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, has already pointed out, the Audit Commission does not address the fact that we may not have sufficient resources. The issue might be put into context if I break with habit and read what the Audit Commission says about itself:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Audit Commission is an independent body responsible for ensuring that public money is spent economically, efficiently and effectively, to achieve high-quality local and national services for the public. Our work covers local government, health and criminal justice services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-09_para36"></a>
It does not say how big the cake is and whether it is big enough to feed all the people; it simply says that it should be done efficiently.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para37"></a> I am convinced that the Audit Commission will say that statements, which absorb money because they allocate needs effectively, are inefficient. More importantly, groups such as the National Autistic Society, the British Dyslexia Association and the RNID, to name a few, are very good at ensuring that people now receive statements.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para38"></a>Another problem pointed out in the report was that it is the middle-class child with the articulate parent who obtains a statement. I am reminded of dyslexia, which was known as the "middle-class disease". Problems do exist but, until we get something better, we shall be in trouble if we try to get rid of the statement. We should not do so until we are able to produce a better framework with teachers who know not only that dyslexia is a Greek derivative word <P>


<a name="column_1194"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>meaning that one's spelling is bad, but who know fundamentally more about the variations that exist, how people are affected in later life and how there are different learning strategies.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para39"></a>I do not even dare to embark on the subject of autistic spectrum disorder. There are dozens of other groups concerned with hearing and sight problems&#151;that is, sensory problems. Until the problems that can occur are known&#151;at least, in theory, in the classroom&#151;people will always be playing catch-up.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para40"></a> I believe that the Audit Commission was absolutely right to point out that we are not giving the teachers a fair start. If we are talking about integrating 10 or 20 per cent of children with a disability-based, special educational needs problem into the classroom, then it is inconceivable that a teacher would be able to meet the problems that he would face without starting with a better basis of factual knowledge. I believe that some people are receiving only two or three hours' initial training. A technical factual base is vital in getting this matter right. We must provide such a start.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para41"></a>The Government are always telling us that more will be done in this area. But perhaps we may finally have a Statement at some point saying that league tables are a problem. Such a high proportion of the school population will have difficulty in passing examinations or there will be so many holes in the exam-passing mechanisms that it will not add up. There cannot be simple league tables; they must be adjusted in some way. If they are adjusted often enough, surely league tables will become so complicated that they will become useless. If we are to be fair to special educational needs, we must tackle that problem. At present, teachers are having to defend their positions.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para42"></a> I do not know what more can be said on the subject. I shall simply say that if 20 per cent of the school population can potentially lower the status of a professional institution, that is not a great way forward. I hope that we shall hear more about that. But I suggest that the ultimate answer is, at the very least, to get rid of these crude league tables and to consider their entire status.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para43"></a>I hope that the answer that we reach in considering our whole approach to this matter is that in future it might be possible to get rid of the statement. I believe that we can do so if we institute better training and better resourcing in special educational needs. But that should not happen now or in the immediate future because, at present, it is the only show in town and we do need something.

<A NAME="30129-09_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I begin by thanking my noble friend Lady Warnock for providing another opportunity to discuss such an important issue. As president of Mencap, as the father of a daughter with Down's Syndrome and as the grandfather of a grandson with a like syndrome, it is an issue close to my heart, as it is to the hearts of many other noble Lords present. In one sense, it has all been said before, but I do not apologise for saying it again. Each child <P>


<a name="column_1195"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with special educational needs who gets less than the best we can offer is an affront to both our society and our educational system.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para44"></a>With not a little help from this House, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, and her colleagues have done a good job on education and disability. They deserve credit for that. Nevertheless, I need to sound a note of caution. Legislation is important&#151;we would not all be sitting here if we believed otherwise. However, even more important is the implementation of that legislation locally&#151;in each local education authority and in each school. The findings from the two recent Audit Commission reports do not leave me with great optimism about the extent to which we have already secured full-blooded implementation.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para45"></a>In my view, special education means tailoring to the individual needs of the child the curriculum, the teaching skills, the teaching materials and the measures of achievement. With that tailored support, every child can enjoy his or her childhood and fulfil his potential. Having seen what children labelled as "ineducable" have achieved, I am not willing to settle for anything less than the best that we can offer. That means that mainstream schools and pre-school groups must try much harder.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para46"></a>In the light of the two Audit Commission reports and their tale of what has yet to be attempted and achieved, I want to focus on two areas that particularly affect children with a learning disability: early years provision in inclusive groups and meeting health needs in mainstream and special schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para47"></a>One of the recent Audit Commission reports made a very strong case for a substantial increase in early years investment. Children with severe learning and other disabilities are too readily sidelined into specialist settings&#151;bypassing the experience and losing the benefits of mainstream nurseries or pre-school playgroups. Separation can mean isolation: missing out on early educational experiences and on early social experiences as being members of their local community. The children are separated from their brothers and sisters and from their potential friends. At the same time, their parents are separated from important contacts with other parents.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para48"></a>Inclusion is a real possibility for virtually all children, particularly in the early years, and it should be explored, not ignored. Indeed, there are many examples of children with the most complex needs being successfully included to their benefit and to the benefit of other children. As I said, the Audit Commission calls for more investment in early years provision for disabled children. Quality is not cheap; and I am pleased to hear about the new special educational needs and disability development fund. Can the Minister confirm that that will be extra money and that some of it will be used to support the inclusion of children with complex needs during the vital early years?
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para49"></a>To pursue my central theme of including those who are most readily excluded, I jump from early years education to the subject of meeting the health needs of pupils with special educational needs. If that seems a <P>


<a name="column_1196"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>jump too far, I trust your Lordships will remember that Eddie the Eagle was once a national hero. Since my noble friend Lady Warnock wrote her historic report some 25 years ago, there have been significant changes in the child population. Many more profoundly disabled babies are surviving. That steady rise in a very special population is thought to be due to improvements in healthcare, including enhanced prospects of survival for premature babies. By no means all, but a significant proportion of those children have multiple disabilities and complex health needs. Unless the Minister can tell me otherwise&#151;we do not have precise numbers but we are talking about some thousands of children who may need to be tube-fed, are on complex medication or need specialist support of some other kind.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para50"></a>Mencap's report, Don't Count Me Out, revealed the exclusion from school life experienced by children with substantial health support needs. This very day Mencap has held a seminar to bring experts in the field together to help to plan the changes that are needed to include all children with health needs in education. Progress in that area is patchy. Some schools have been able to include children with major health needs with a minimum of fuss. Sadly, in other areas schools have made it clear to parents that their child was being refused admission on health grounds. Some claim that insurance is the problem, while others claim that they do not have a school nurse. Whatever the excuse, exclusion on health grounds is clearly discriminatory and the Disability Rights Commission, with the support of Mencap and many other organisations, is keen to do battle to stop such discrimination.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para51"></a>Severe disability comes as a challenge to some head teachers and school governors; it does not come easily to the parents or indeed to the child either. However, those who have risen to the challenge have shown that even the most complex health needs can be met successfully with the help of health colleagues. My generation of parents fought to get any kind of education for their disabled children. My wife and I, together with other parents, raised thousands of pounds to build a school many years before the 1970 disability legislation came into force. Today's parents still struggle to acquire the best education for their disabled children. Many want mainstream education, but all want really good appropriate education. None has a child who is ineducable, but there have been some blatant cases of discrimination against children and young people with learning disabilities, of whom society's expectations and priorities are often appallingly low, especially when it comes to educational needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para52"></a>Often discrimination is not premeditated; it arises out of a lack of imagination and planning, and sometimes a lack of resources to develop the right infrastructure in which disabled children can flourish. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act has removed many barriers of exclusion and blatant discrimination for disabled children but, as with the weeds in my garden, new barriers seem to spring up <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30129-09_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to debate special education provision following the Audit Commission's report. I thank my noble friend Lady Warnock for initiating the debate and for her report that gave birth to the 1981 Act which together with the codes of practice in the 1993 and the 1996 Acts forms the pillars that prop up special education law.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para54"></a>Only six months ago at Third Reading of the Education Act 2002, which introduced powers to free schools from the national curriculum and so on, many noble Lords who are present today were involved in tabling an amendment to secure for the future the legal safety net for children with special educational needs created by those pillars: the duty to identify, to assess and to statement when necessary. My noble friend Lady Warnock was swift and stalwart in her support. At cols. 226 to 227 of the Official Report on 3rd July 2002&#151;I paraphrase&#151;she said that the so-called 18 per cent of children without statements were those at risk of being swallowed in the excitement of innovation&#151;which was greatly welcomed&#151;and that the preservation of the duty to identify children with special educational needs was the most important part of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para55"></a>Your Lordships will remember that the Minister, while unable to agree to the amendment, gave firm assurances at cols. 230 to 235 that the protection would remain, but that innovation, if judged in the best interest of children with special education needs, would be permitted. I am sorry to go over old ground, but I believe that, welcome as the noble Lord's view may be, we need to keep the concept of the safety net firmly in mind. I hope that the Minister will reiterate that assurance today.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para56"></a>The first report argued for a high level review of statements. Eighty per cent of responses supported that recommendation. It is interesting to note that the least supportive of it were SENCOs, parents of children with statements and voluntary organisations, the people nearest to delivery or receipt of special education provision. They worried that the review may be focused unduly on the erosion or the removal of statements in a world where there is no other framework for assuring parents of the provision to be made for the child. Several said that they would welcome strengthening the law around statements, rather than scrapping them and argued for some practical solutions.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para57"></a> IPSEA, of which I am a patron, said that at present, the law which gives disabled children legal rights to appropriate provision can only be enforced by individual parents in respect of individual children. That is manifestly very hard especially for those children whose parents, for whatever reason, lack the <P>


<a name="column_1198"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ability or the resources to challenge the actions of their LEA. That was a problem that was also highlighted by the National Autistic Society.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para58"></a>For many years IPSEA has argued for the establishment of an independent enforcement agency that could ensure that LEAs fulfil their legal duties towards disabled children. That could be achieved through an extension of the ombudsman's role or that of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal. That is a practical suggestion that would remove from parents the burden of having to police local education authorities. It would bring immediate benefit to many children.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para59"></a>The second report highlighted difficulties with SEN as a mainstream issue. Many of those points&#151;weak accountability for SEN provision or a patchy approach to early intervention and so on&#151;underlined the importance of the safety net. As the SEC puts it, precisely because of the difficulties identified in the second report, it is crucial that we have the statutory framework in place. The SEC welcomes the second report and the 10 point agenda for action, and has been pressing for many of those points for a long time. The Government have done much to promote some of them and the report will be a spur to putting the more neglected elements back at the top of the agenda. The new duties on schools and LEAs to increase access to schools for disabled pupils should be a great help and with the new initiatives involving a multi-agency approach for pupils at a very young age it is hoped that children will no longer experience failure before they receive additional help. The National Autistic Society and the RNID made that point.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para60"></a>However, the SEC stressed that even if statements are being very little used, it is important that they are not abolished. They still provide the safety net, should schools or LEAs be unwilling or unable to provide for the individual child's special education. I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said about cost. A small increase in what is spent would produce a spectacular result.
<P>

<a name="30129-09_para61"></a>Why do I sound such a fuddy-duddy when I used to go on about integration and then inclusion? I should be the last to meddle in Scottish affairs, certainly since devolution. The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, was in her place; unfortunately, she is no longer present.

<a name="30129-10_para0"></a> Last Friday, the Scottish Parliament published a Bill, the Education (Additional Support for Learning)(Scotland) Bill.

<P>


<a name="column_1199"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para1"></a>The warning that we must heed from the actions of the Scottish Parliament is that not all those engaged in the debate on the legal framework for the delivery of special educational provision will have as their prime concern the aim of protecting and extending disabled children's education. Some will argue, as it seems to be argued in Scotland, that it is too bureaucratic to assess individual disabled children's needs and too expensive to provide for them. That is why I was so delighted that we had the debate in the summer during which the Minister gave us her firm commitment about that. I do not suggest that that argument will prevail, but things can go pear-shaped and we always need safety nets.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para2"></a>I am less hesitant about raising another point about Scotland. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 covers Britain&#151;it is not devolved legislation. Noble Lords will remember that when that Act was extended to cover schools, including schools in Scotland, the Government decided that failure to provide the auxiliary aids or services that a child needs would not constitute discrimination. The reasoning behind that was set out in the code of practice for schools on the Act at paragraph 6.20, to the effect that special educational provision should include any educational aids and services where those are necessary to meet the child's identified needs as specified in the statement.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para3"></a>Clearly, if the legal framework for special education in Scotland is changed to remove children's rights to assessment and provision, they will be exposed to disadvantage under both education law and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. It is not for me to decide how to sort things out, but I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, will convey that message, as he promised. The Disability Rights Commission in Scotland is well aware of that difficulty. When the Scotland Office consulted on the ideas behind the Bill, the DRC in Scotland argued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not in the best interests of the child to displace the legal right to assessment, recording"&#151;
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-10_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30129-10_para6"></a> By all means let us have a full review, innovate and be imaginative, but I urge the Government to hang on to the safety net. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington said, we have not yet gone far enough to do without it, if we ever will. One never knows; things can go pear-shaped, as we have seen in Scotland. Let us hope that that can be sorted out, but if the two pillars were to become the twin towers and the whole safety net were to collapse, children with special educational needs would be left without a lifeline.

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para7"></a>I shall speak briefly from my perspective as a bishop and from the point of view of the Church of England, which has always been much concerned with education&#151;not least, to cite the Board of Education, with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the education of the most disadvantaged in society and of children with special educational needs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-10_para8"></a>
Those priorities were reiterated in the Church's report entitled, The Way Ahead, published two years ago in response to a General Synod debate in 1999 that identified Church schools as being at the heart of the Church's overriding concern with mission.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para9"></a>A bishop has a particular interest in that aspect of education. At his consecration service, he is charged by the archbishop to have a special care for the outcast and the needy. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, eloquently explained how wide a spectrum of disadvantage we need to consider&#151;not simply those children whose special needs are such as to warrant a statement but all those from variously disadvantaged backgrounds, for social, political, economic or linguistic reasons, who need special care, encouragement and help. So the cause is dear to my heart.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para10"></a>However, to concentrate for a moment on statemented children, I agree with what has been said by most noble Lords during the debate: we need to retain that system. It is interesting to note how policies towards their education have changed over the years. In the early 1980s, following the establishment of the new framework, there was at long last a recognition of the need for both proper identification of special educational needs and the inclusion of children with those needs, as far as possible, within mainstream schools&#151;although it is of course true that the most severely disadvantaged children will continue to need to be educated in special schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para11"></a>I have two severely autistic great nephews for whom inclusive education was briefly possible in a local primary school with special support. Both now have to be educated in special schools. I am glad to say that that education is reasonably satisfactory.

<a name="30129-10_para12"></a> In Herefordshire&#151;or Hereford and Worcester, as the LEA was in the 1980s&#151;special units were established in each secondary school. Since 1997, most of them have been disbanded. The statutory framework for inclusion, Inclusive Schooling, Children with Special Educational Needs, published in 2001, gives all statemented children a strengthened right to a place in a mainstream school unless that would be incompatible with the wishes of their parents or&#151;this is difficult to evaluate&#151;with the provision of efficient education of other children.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para13"></a>As noble Lords have mentioned, there is an inherent conflict of interest between the inclusion agenda and the league table culture. They make uneasy bedfellows and can sometimes cause serious tension or outright conflict. The inclusion of children with moderate or severe learning difficulties in ordinary classes creates enormous difficulties in most cases, although some schools&#151;I speak in particular of Church schools&#151;that have welcomed SEN children have found it an enriching experience.

<a name="30129-10_para14"></a>The answer must be that we need varied and flexible provision. Classroom assistants can give valuable help with moderate SEN children or children who do not have a statement but still have considerable problems with learning. Last week, I visited a primary school on the edge of Telford, an area of considerable social deprivation, that has been turned around, by a brilliant headmaster, from a failing school to a beacon school in which, in one classroom, three classroom assistants are working with the class teacher in a good and happy atmosphere.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para15"></a>But the disbandment of most special units in secondary schools in Herefordshire has meant that secondary-aged children in the county with more severe problems&#151;either of physical disability or of learning difficulty&#151;have gravitated to the one remaining specialist unit, which is excellent. It is within the Church of England secondary school in Hereford itself, happily called the Bishop of Hereford Bluecoat School. That unit accommodates 46 children in a school of about 1,100 with generous specialist staffing needs. It is on the campus, physically linked to the main buildings yet distinct and distinctive in its ethos and style. It is an impressive place. The children who go there are happy and achieve what are for them remarkable results. There are excellent relationships between the SEN and other children&#151;good social interaction, which is beneficial to all.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para16"></a>Let me give another example, this time from the primary sector and from Suffolk. A Church of England voluntary aided primary school there has worked very closely with the LEA and has provided for two classrooms to be adapted and staffed in order that statemented children, some with multiple disabilities, can be educated within the environment of a mainstream school, with real benefits, education and social, to the whole school community.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para17"></a>In the same county&#151;this picks up on the issue of a wider interpretation of multiple disadvantage and the special education provision which may be necessary&#151;the diocese and the LEA are working together on a Sure Start project for pre-school children with severe behavioural difficulties which enables them, after proper assessment, to move into mainstream schooling.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para18"></a>These are small but typical examples of good practice, implementing an inclusive policy in a sensitive way which respects all the children involved, those with special needs and those without. From my conversations with teachers, I believe that there is a reluctance on the part of the teaching profession to embark on further new developments, let alone to see new legislation introduced at this stage, although I recognise the point, well made by the noble Baroness, about the disproportionate resources which at present are going into the statementing process. We need to find some way of reducing that disproportionate use of resources.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para19"></a>It would be better to share existing good practice. There is not an even spread of good practice across the country and sharing it must be the first way forward to <P>


<a name="column_1202"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increase the integration of the Sure Start and Home Start projects with local schools which can do so much to help children get a good start when they first enter primary schooling.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para20"></a>Alongside that initiative for very young children, there must be continuing efforts to overcome the multiple problems caused by poverty, broken homes and all the damaging consequences of disfunctional families and social exclusion. But I suggest, for the time being at least, that we will have to live with the statementing process and build on best practice.

<A NAME="30129-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as editor of the Good Schools Guide.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para21"></a>The 1981 report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, was a great achievement from which many good things have flowed. If one looks back over the years at what life was like for the kind of children who are now statemented&#151;before the process began, before the Warnock report and before the progress that has been made&#151;we can see that undoubtedly things are much better than they were and that we have done many good things. However, I share entirely the noble Baroness's analysis that we have reached a point where we need to look to see whether we are going in the right direction and whether we could not do better by changing tack to some extent.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para22"></a>It is not satisfactory that local authorities are seen as the enemy of statemented children, but it is inevitable given the current structure of funding. Local authorities are under a great deal of funding pressure. They have very little free money in their schools budgets&#151;a delegation of which I thoroughly approve&#151;which necessarily makes the statementing process contentious. In many local authorities great delays creep into the process, to the great distress of parents and the disadvantage of the child.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para23"></a>It is a process which, in financial terms, can be extremely difficult to manage and can result in a great misallocation of resources. The system is bureaucratic. Educational psychologists and other people&#151;a resource which is very short in this country&#151;are tied up in the process and do not have time to dedicate themselves to looking after the children. It is very rare that a local education authority EP sees a child twice. The child is seen for the statementing process and then the EP is gone. If we were providing proper support for children in need of educational psychological assessment, it would happen every couple of years or so in order that a child's progress through the system could be charted and adjustments made as necessary.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para24"></a>A system is emerging where resources are very much directed at 2 per cent of the school population. If you are a fraction outside that, you get nothing. In many schools, 98 per cent of the population do not benefit from the things that are done for SEN children. The way things are going, the way things are structured at the moment, I cannot see how this situation will do anything but get worse.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para25"></a> Parents, not unnaturally, see the statementing system as the solution to their problems with their child, and those who are articulate and able will push <P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely hard to get their child into the system because of the benefits that flow from it. And quite rightly too. If the money is there for that purpose, I entirely support parents who choose to make use of it. But it is a source of continuing pressure on the system, and will continue to be the source of distress and malfunctions within the system in years to come if we do not look for a better way of managing it.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para26"></a>There are possibilities for doing things differently. My vision is for a system based on SEN-friendly schools, taking inclusion a stage further to the point where schools are truly able to deal, in a routine way, with most mainstream SENs. This would involve schools taking a great deal more responsibility in this area than they do at the moment. It would involve a great deal of training, principally. Teachers should be trained to deal with children with dyslexia, Asperger's and ADHD and other disabilities. Resources should be available with the SENCO or with the LEA to help a teacher who needs an additional understanding of how to deal with a child who has a mainstream SEN in a disruptive or extreme way.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para27"></a> The structure is already there in some schools. Such schools are wonderful for all children because a school that is good at dealing with special needs is a school that pays attention to the needs of every child. It adapts itself to the needs of every child, rather than having a set way of operating and letting the children bump around regardless of their individual needs. That kind of school can deal with the needs of most children with SEN, providing great benefits to all children in the process.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para28"></a>Under that kind of structure you could put a border on statementing. You could say, "This is what should be treated by the school and anything beyond that will be provided for by the statementing process". I imagine that most of the charges of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, would stay within the statementing process. Children who require such a degree of support need specialist, individually provided and individually crafted support, whereas most children with dyslexia can deal with an environment where the resources are there and teachers know how to help the child make use of them, but they are not specially provided for the child.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para29"></a>You could give parents the right to expect and schools the duty to provide that kind of education. You could provide the resources to schools as part of their financial baseline to train teachers up to the necessary standards. You could expect schools to have a general awareness of special education needs. You could expect schools to indulge in baseline testing so that they know the pattern of abilities and disabilities of their students and know how to respond to it. You could expect schools to have teaching styles which are SEN friendly. And, in many other ways, you could expect schools to provide, as a matter of routine, the kind of support that parents now have to fight for under the statementing system.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para30"></a>I do not believe that we can hope to establish such a system merely by making changes in legislation and saying, "We now expect schools to do this", and <P>


<a name="column_1204"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leaving all those children who are presently supported by the SEN system to sink or swim according to whether or not their school responded in a correct way to this change in expectations. It is much more complicated than that. Under those circumstances, the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is quite right to ask for a proper investigation and report on how such a change might be achieved.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para31"></a>I would like to see a situation in which children with SEN could expect support from all the professionals who were involved in the SEN business. Everything would work together to make sure that they received the support they needed, but in a way that benefited everybody and kept costs under control. People would not have to fight all the time to have extra money spent on their child as the resources would be available in the way that they are for the ordinary needs of most schoolchildren as a matter of course.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para32"></a>It is worth looking again at the system. I do not think that we can go on the way we are, and so I thoroughly support the Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock.

<A NAME="30129-10_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for allowing us this opportunity to think carefully about special education. I have no view on statements&#151;I do not have the experience to have such a view. I am concerned about inclusion, particularly the inclusion of children in care, and that is why I speak.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para33"></a>I should like to describe how one primary school maximises inclusion and works very much in the spirit of what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has just said. I should also like to call attention to one model of teacher support that I think could be more widely used. I suggest that we have smaller secondary schools in areas of high deprivation or devise some means to make smaller community schools for secondary students in those areas.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para34"></a>Marion Rosen, the head teacher of Star primary school, has minimised the number of her children needing statements. She has achieved that in a school of over 600 pupils that has a higher than average number of pupils on free school meals. The school has very high pupil mobility&#151;half the pupils have spent less than two years there. The establishment is in Newham, an area with large numbers of families in bed-and-breakfast and substandard accommodation. The area's social services are overstretched and under-resourced. In this area, a child's death was associated with fearfulness on the part of the social services department to visit the violent parents. The neighbourhood has a large ethnic minority, asylum-seeker and refugee population.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para35"></a>In 1997, Star primary school was in special measures. Marion Rosen was seconded in March 1999, and by March 2000, her institution was removed from special measures. Sadly, there is not time to catalogue and detail all the improvements the head teacher and staff have made. If your Lordships are curious to learn more about this remarkable school, please ask me outwith the Chamber.

<a name="30129-10_para36"></a>Star primary school has two children in the autistic spectrum who have not been statemented. Four-year-old Tanya's needs were identified by Sure Start before she arrived in the nursery. She already has a full-time worker and when she settles into the nursery class she will receive support from a full-time nursery nurse. Later she will be supported full time by a teaching assistant.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para37"></a>On Monday morning of this week, we saw Hamid being taught. Jane, his teaching assistant, had her leg behind his chair so that he could not remove himself from the task in hand. As he turned away, she would reach to the side of his chin and gently redirect his gaze to the work in hand. Watching Jane was Olga, another teaching assistant, who is being trained up with Hamid. Jane was described to me as an outstanding teaching assistant who was being used to model the correct way of working with autistic children.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para38"></a>The funds that might have gone to provide for a statement had here been delegated to the school for it to develop the whole school framework to provide for children with SEN. In co-operation with the local education authority, three criteria for deciding the quantity of delegated funding were identified&#151;the numbers of children on the school roll, the numbers of children on free school meals and the rate of pupil mobility. Additional funding is available by application to a board of special education needs co-ordination officers, who moderate such payments.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para39"></a>With the assistance of this funding, money from Sure Start, Excellence in Cities and the Healthy Schools initiatives as well as from education action zones, Marion Rosen and her staff have transformed their school. According to the latest Ofsted report, Star primary
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is now a very good school providing good value for money. This is an inclusive school which provides a very good education for all pupils. The school has made rapid improvement because of the head teacher's careful analysis of the needs of the school and the very effective management systems and structures she has put in place. The quality of provision for pupils with Special Educational Needs has improved under the inspired leadership of the school's Access Manager".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-10_para40"></a><P>

<a name="30129-10_para41"></a>One needs to be realistic in making decisions about which children will benefit from inclusion in the mainstream. One needs to ensure that they do not hinder or harm other children. There is still an important role for special schools. At Star primary school, two children benefit from three days a week at a local special school. However, the better managed and resourced a school is, the more able it is to include challenging pupils and harmonise them into the whole school. That is what one sees at Star primary, Marion Rosen's school.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para42"></a>Last night, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;I see that she is in her place&#151;and I were reminded of the Office for National Statistics figures for the mental health of pre-school children. Some 15 per cent have moderate mental health difficulties, while an additional 7 per cent have severe mental health difficulties. In the United States, one in seven children <P>


<a name="column_1206"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is prescribed Ritalin, a drug to manage hyperactivity. Such hyperactivity in children is associated with post-natal depression in their mothers.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para43"></a> Lady Young is with us in spirit today, and I hear her drawing attention, as she always so eloquently did, to the changes in family structure that have contributed to this. However, there is no going back to past models of family life. We must deal with the needs of children and families as we are confronted with them now. We should also recognise that our decision not to invest in housing, not to invest more in midwives, health visitors, social workers and teachers has pushed many of those families that might have been viable over the edge.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para44"></a>In this context, I ask the Minister to consider making available to staff of schools with particularly challenging children regular consultation with an appropriate mental health professional. It would be on a group basis and the consultant would need an understanding of the particular circumstances of schools. Such a service might play an important part in teachers' professional development and prove an effective means of strengthening teachers' capacity to deal with emotionally unhealthy children and occasionally with their emotionally unhealthy parents. It might well prove useful in improving the retention of teachers in such stressful environments.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para45"></a>Three weeks ago I was speaking with the manager of a children's home who has 30 years' experience. Once every three weeks, she and her staff meet and discuss their work with a child psychotherapist from the Anna Freud centre. This has been part of the home's culture for many years and the manager has found it invaluable.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para46"></a>I have seen a similar system at work to great effect at Centrepoint. Speaking today with the deputy head of a well respected pupil referral unit in Lambeth, I was told that his staff benefit from such a consultation once a month. He, too, finds it invaluable but dearly wishes that it could be more frequent. His view is that many mainstream schools could benefit from such support and significantly fewer pupils might then be excluded.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para47"></a>If teachers are to work effectively in milieux within which there are growing numbers of increasingly troubled young people&#151;and, from what I hear, there are worrying increases in disturbed behaviour in children, with increasingly young children acting in very troubling ways&#151;they need to be adequately supported in doing so. I should make clear that I am not suggesting that teachers stop teaching and concentrate on their pastoral role. Rather, I believe it may be necessary for teachers to have a protected place in which to think about their work. They might then be better enabled to teach well; to teach creatively; and to carry on teaching well and creatively.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para48"></a>In that proposal, I am supported by Kairen Cullen, head of the child and educational psychology department of the British Psychological Society. Marion Rosen, last Monday morning, repeated to me several times the need to make schools more emotionally literate. If the Minister would care for more information about that proposal, I will gladly furnish her with it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para49"></a>Finally, as we rethink special education and as we think about inclusion, perhaps we can also think about the size of our secondary schools. Is their scale suitable for building a sense of community, a sense of being valued and of being considered among their pupils? Are children who have lacked nourishment within their families likely to warm to an anonymous institution in which the head teacher may know them by name only if they cause trouble?
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para50"></a>Practitioners are telling me and academic research demonstrates that we need to give serious consideration to smaller secondary schools&#151;not necessarily smaller classes&#151;in areas of high deprivation. Alternatively, it might be possible to have larger schools broken down into smaller units where every child and adult knows every other child and adult.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para51"></a>My time is up. I am grateful to the children's mental health charity, Young Minds, for its advice in preparation for the debate. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lady Warnock, who is so deeply knowledgeable about SEN children, for raising the matter for debate. While I was reading the Audit Commission's report, my mind went back to the late 1950s when I was on the management committee for Botley's Park hospital for those suffering from mental deficiency, as it was called in those days. I admit to being fairly appalled at the conditions that existed then for the patients&#151;including children&#151;and I suppose that from then on I have supported campaigns for reforms aimed at what is today called "inclusiveness"; that is, enabling those with handicaps to live as full a life as the rest of us. However, sometimes I wonder whether we think through sufficiently the consequences of our well-meaning policy changes.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para52"></a>One recent Starred Question in your Lordships' House wanted to know whether the NHS had abolished mixed wards in hospitals. Yet it is not that long ago that after much campaigning these were introduced. Those of us who had campaigned&#151;including myself&#151;felt that to keep the sexes separate in this way, especially in long-stay hospitals, was not the natural way the rest of would want to live. That example illustrates the kind of problems we face today due to the well-meaning emphasis on full education opportunities for SEN children and, in particular, our wish for as many as possible of them to be educated in mainstream primary and secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para53"></a>I am not suggesting that that approach is wrong. But I fear that unless more resources are allocated the short-term effect may well be the exact opposite of what was intended.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para54"></a>A top government priority&#151;rightly, in my view&#151;is to get children out of poverty. SEN children, like looked-after children, form a targeted group within the category. But, sadly, the report highlights sharply that this group is still not the priority it should be. There are even some potentially counter-indicative trends emerging.
<P>


<a name="column_1208"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para55"></a>We have heard how the budget of £3.6 million is split between children with statements and those without. That leaves only one-third of the budget to be spread over the remaining 1.5 million children. No wonder the vast majority of SEN children are not diagnosed early enough. There are clearly far too few resources available for that important early diagnostic work, which, with the right support, might well prevent later suffering and expenditure.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para56"></a>Secondly, there is an appalling dearth of reliable statistics, not least about the higher absentee and permanent exclusion rates for SEN pupils. LEAs' provision and support services generally vary considerably. Some case studies show just what can be achieved, but the overall picture is fairly dismal.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para57"></a>Thirdly, there are concerns from SEN children and their parents. These include, for example, difficulties over school access&#151;and not just for the physically disabled. There is a lack of speech therapists and a perceived lack of friendliness on the part of other pupils and, no doubt, for seemingly good reasons such as safety, restrictions on access to some curriculum subjects and the fuller school life. There are hints, too, that one reason why fewer academic SEN children may be discouraged from taking exam subjects is the competitive league table problem.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para58"></a>Recommendations to deal with many of these problems are made in the report. They include more training in SEN for all teachers in their induction year. But there is a general need for wider knowledge at all levels of SEN problems and how to cope with them. There is a need, too, for far better support from the LEAs' educational psychology service and more detailed record keeping by both LEAs and schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para59"></a>But, apart from children's educational needs, as the report points out:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is clear that educational inclusion poses particular challenges to health and social services, as children with complex needs who might previously have been grouped together in special schools are increasingly attending mainstream schools".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-10_para60"></a>
As my noble friend Lord Rix said, many more babies survive who might not have done so previously, which is good. We face, too, a more complex scene partly because of a better understanding of the range and complexity of those with SEN. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned autism. It was not that long ago that autism was not acknowledged and parents fought strongly to win that acknowledgement. Now we have a spectrum of autistic disorders, all of which contributes to the complexity of the problem.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para61"></a>So have we got the policy wrong? Are more children, not fewer, being disadvantaged socially as well as educationally by our wish to see as many as possible educated within mainstream schools? I am sure that the answer to that question should still be "No". But despite the considerable efforts in some areas, and considerable improvements over the past few years in some areas, the report shows how much work there is still to do.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para62"></a>Much the most important factor is the need for a joined-up-government approach&#151;very much at the heart of the Minister's thinking. We need to use every <P>


<a name="column_1209"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>kind of resource available, statutory and voluntary, at both central and local government level. Almost certainly the families most in need of help will be from poorer, more disadvantaged, often dysfunctional backgrounds. They should all have been identified, although clearly this has not happened and not early enough, through splendid schemes such as Excellence in Cities and Sure Start.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para63"></a>On the voluntary side, this should be a major target area for established organisations and for those such as the Experience Corps, which is doing so well in recruiting the new wave of retired volunteers. Home Start, on the voluntary side, is exactly the kind of hands-on practical support needed, with individual, confidence-building relationships developed and practical help given where needed.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para64"></a>Finally, I turn to the teachers themselves. As I read and agreed the report's recommendations, my heart sank. I think I have supported almost all of this Government's attempts to break the Keith Joseph "cycle of deprivation" and yet I am beginning to feel we are asking teachers to take on far too much simultaneously. They need&#151;and must have&#151;more time and resources to tackle these requests and, above all, to do the actual teaching they are qualified to do. That is why we must look hopefully for a fast-growing number of assistants to be involved in classroom work in future.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para65"></a>I close by emphasising that these key people&#151;the teachers and those who work with them and, dare I say it, ahead even of those responsible for our health&#151;should have the resources, proper pay and respect that reflects the vital role they play in our society.

The debate was an Unstarred Question in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, to ask Her Majesty's Government what consideration they were giving to introducing legislation to protect people with mental incapacity. I devoted most of my remarks to the very distressing situation which is being created&#151;perhaps, one should say, made even worse&#151;by the recent Special Educational Needs and Disability Act with its <P>


<a name="column_1210"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>emphasis on mainstream education for all children, however handicapped, if that is what their parents want. The distressing situation to which I refer is that parents of children with mental handicap or severe learning disabilities are finding it even harder than before to place their children in special schools if that is what they want to do because they believe it to be essential for their children.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para68"></a>In the debate, I quoted the assurance of the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, when the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill was going through your Lordships' House early in 2001, that parents who want special schools would not find themselves in a worse position as a result of the Bill. I drew the Government's attention to a substantial article in the Daily Telegraph on 12th December 2002; and I quoted from a letter in the same newspaper on 14th December from Mr Mic Carolan, headmaster of Hurst Special School in St Helens, both of which set out the detail of the difficulties I have mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para69"></a>The debate on 18th December was focused on the many problems surrounding mental incapacity in general and was answered, therefore, for the Government by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's Department. I did ask the noble Baroness to do her best to make sure that her colleagues in education took note of what I had to say and of the article and correspondence in the Daily Telegraph. It is entirely understandable that the noble Baroness did not confirm in her winding up speech that she would do so, and so my purpose in intervening briefly tonight is merely to make sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, and her colleagues in the Department for Education are indeed aware of what I said on 18th December and will take it into consideration in their deliberations on the future of special education needs in this country. The noble Baroness nods her head. So on the assumption that she will feel able to do so, I need trouble your Lordships no further now.

<A NAME="30129-10_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for initiating the debate and for raising this important if challenging question: whether the process of statementing has outlived its usefulness.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para70"></a>Two years ago, we were debating the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill, now an Act. For the most part, we were united in our vision of the inclusive society that we wanted to see in which each child was treated as an individual and his or her needs met within the school system, either mainstream or special schools. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, assured us that the special schools system still had a place, even though she and other noble Lords wanted to see a more inclusive approach within mainstream schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para71"></a>However, at the time we warned that such a vision needed resources to match it. The vision of a mainstream school which is thoroughly inclusive was <P>


<a name="column_1211"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mentioned today when the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred to Star Primary School. It is a primary school that I, too, have visited. I was enormously impressed. But it is a primary school in an Excellence in Cities programme, receiving vast resources. That two children who are not statemented can be given classroom assistance indicates that the school has resources for that purpose. Most mainstream primary schools do not have the resources to devote a classroom assistant to an individual child unless they are statemented. That is one reason why schools and parents are anxious to get children with special needs statemented: it brings extra resources into the schools to enable them to cope with those problems.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para72"></a>We warned the Minister time and again that in some senses the aspirations and visions set out in the Bill required resources. By and large, at the time the Minister and the Government were willing the end but not the means. The estimates of the costs of implementing the Bill were grossly inadequate.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para73"></a>In the two reports received last year, the Audit Commission gives a good snapshot of what has been happening. It considers the question of resources. A number of noble Lords have asked whether there are enough resources. My answer is no. When debating the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act, it was clear that many noble Lords believed that resources were insufficient. However, it is not the Audit Commission's role to say whether resources are sufficient. Its main job is to consider the resources available and to advise local authorities on whether those resources are being spent wisely and whether we are getting value for money. It is clear from the two reports that at present the commission feels that even if there are not enough resources, the resources available are not always spent wisely. The question that many of us have been hit by is why 70 per cent of the resources are being spent on the small minority of children with statements. Is that right, or do we need more resources in the system as a whole?
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para74"></a>Among the issues that the Audit Commission has identified as being unsatisfactory in the present use of resources is, first, the arbitrariness of provision. Whether needs are met varies enormously between local authorities and schools. There is a complete postcode lottery in that regard. Secondly, the Audit Commission has made it clear that the early years agenda is hardly being addressed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said. Thirdly, there remains a big problem of interagency co-operation. Fourthly, there are major shortcomings in training. A huge effort needs to be made to ensure that all staff have some understanding of how to cope with the challenges of children with special educational needs and to put best practice into practice.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para75"></a> Fifthly, there are major tensions in schools between the performance and inclusion agendas, as highlighted by the fact that a disproportionate number of children with special educational needs find it difficult to gain admission to the school of their choice and, subsequently, a disproportionate number tend to be excluded.
<P>


<a name="column_1212"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para76"></a>Lastly, but by no means least, it is extremely difficult to monitor what is happening because there is no coherent monitoring of what schools are doing with special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para77"></a>In the time available, I shall consider four of the issues from that list. First, on the matter of the tension between performance demands that are made on schools and the special educational needs agenda, only a couple of weeks ago the schools Minister reiterated that in the light of the disappointing STATS results for key stage 2, the Government would renew their pressure on teachers to get better performance from children. That is a most unsatisfactory approach. We know that those statistics are unsatisfactory because they are crude at the moment. Yes, we are beginning to receive value-added statistics but, if the secondary school value-added tables are anything to go by, they will not be worth much more than what we have now.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para78"></a>Why do we have to go on treating children as statistics rather than as individuals? The whole purpose of the inclusion agenda is to treat children as individuals, as we should be doing. As the Audit Commission says, there should be a separate plan for each child; each child needs to be monitored according to its own plan, not according to set performance indicators from Her Majesty's Government.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para79"></a>Secondly, I want to address the issue of early intervention. It is clear that the sooner that one identifies needs and starts to meet them, the lesser are the problems that must be met. One has only to consider the costs&#151;not only to society. When children are emotionally and behaviourally disturbed, as an increasing number are, if one could nip that in the bud one would save on the enormously high costs of hooliganism, of sending children to special schools and at a later stage to what used to be called borstals and now to prison. If we could intervene early enough and help the child and parent, all those costs might be saved. Surestart is a marvellous programme, but we need to follow it up.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para80"></a>That brings me to my next point, which is the need for joined-up thinking and interagency working. As the Audit Commission said, the fact remains that teachers and schools are not involved alone. One needs to bring together health and social services and frequently the housing authority, because many problems may stem from housing difficulties. However, we know perfectly well that there is an enormous shortage of social workers and educational psychologists. In a school where I was a parent/governor, I remember the head saying, "We try to get these people together, but when I ring up the social services and ask them when I can come along, I am told in six weeks time. If I have a problem today, I need these people now for a case conference. It is no good making it in six weeks time".
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para81"></a>The fact is that all local authorities are squeezed by the Government in terms of the local authorities settlement. The situation is extremely difficult, particularly in the South East, and I view the matter very much from the Surrey point of view. We do not have enough social workers. Social services are <P>


<a name="column_1213"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>squeezed. Even to stand still we must increase the council tax by 13 per cent. If we were to fulfil our agenda entirely, we would have to increase the council tax by 20 per cent. It is a difficult agenda. It is made the more difficult by the fact that the money that used to go to schools directly from the DfES is now incorporated within the SSA. For all that the Minister says that the money is there, it is there in the SSA but it is not there on the ground, as it used to be.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para82"></a>Fourthly, I have little time left in which to speak but I wish to say a few words about training. Training requirements are clearly extremely important. We need to train teachers and we need to be aware that specific training is available on each aspect of special education. Teachers have to be put through these training programmes and that takes time. Time is the most precious resource of teachers these days. The headmaster of one of the big local secondary schools told me of a two-year training course on the needs of the visually impaired. Two of his teachers are undertaking that course but they have to do it largely in their own time. As the headmaster said, those teachers are voluntarily undertaking to do that course in their own time. Different training courses are needed across the spectrum of special needs. We expect our teachers to devote an enormous amount of time to such courses. As I say, time is a scarce resource.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para83"></a>I have run out of time myself. However, I should like to finish by coming back to the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, when she asked whether it was time to review statementing. I believe that we need a review. I make two points on that. First, we need to allow time for the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, and the codes of practice that were introduced subsequent to that Act, to shake down, to put it colloquially. Much change is occurring in the system at the moment and we need to see whether it is working. Secondly, I think that a review is probably needed, but we clearly cannot change the system until after such a review has been held. As the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, said, the statement is a lifeline for parents to ensure that they can exert their rights. It is important that that lifeline remains. We must not take it away until a new lifeline is introduced.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-10_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I join noble Lords who have thanked the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for providing us with the opportunity to have this debate. We have very much more to thank the noble Baroness for. I refer to the enormous amount of work that was done in the 1970s, the Warnock report and the Act that followed it. We are enormously grateful to the noble Baroness for that. The great strength of this House is the ability of its Members to select a subject and to provide such informed and expert opinion. It is always a joy to participate in these debates.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para84"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, calls for a new look at the framework in which special educational needs are identified and met. The work that preceded the Warnock report and the Act that followed took <P>


<a name="column_1214"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>place almost 30 years ago. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is right to argue that the world has changed and that assumptions made all those years ago should be challenged today.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para85"></a>Many points have been made tonight to which I should like to respond. But, alas, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, time is our enemy. I cannot do justice therefore to what I consider has been an extremely important debate that needed to be held.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para86"></a>Two main issues need to be considered separately: first, the statutory framework and whether it is timely to call for another fundamental review; and, secondly, the current system, its strengths and weaknesses. I support the call for a review. However, it would take a long time. Therefore, the present system has to be sustained and has to be made to work more effectively. The safety net of the statementing system is important and has been argued for cogently by my noble friend Lord Astor and the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para87"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor concentrated on the condition of autism and the spectrum of related disorders. My noble friend made the case for more effective statementing but I couple with that the concern for non-statemented children who also have special educational needs. Because the system demands it, there is a tendency to focus attention on statements and statemented children. The challenge for teachers in the classroom are those children who are non-statemented. But the problem arises&#151;this was picked up in the report&#151;from both the perception of, and the actual incidence of, the system not meeting the requirements of children who have needs over and above the norm. That is where I believe more effective teacher training is absolutely crucial.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para88"></a>I am attracted to the idea of learning centres outlined by the noble Baroness. I believe that having such centres of excellence would help enormously in many areas. Such centres could help in a practical way but could also help to develop teachers' expertise. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned autism. I do not believe that he chided my noble friend Lord Astor about autism but he was absolutely right to say that it is not a new condition.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para89"></a>I was particularly moved by the programme which told the story of the life of young Prince John. In addition to suffering from epilepsy that young boy probably suffered from autism or a related condition. As one watched the programme it was clear to see how easy it is to become very angry and cross with a child who looks insolent, disaffected or something else. In the same programme one saw what progress could be made by someone who understood, empathised with and worked with the condition of the child. Although it is newly discovered, we have a very long way to go towards identifying and picking up those signs early.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para90"></a>I have some concerns that I hope will be picked up in any review. There is the issue of statementing and non-statementing. I believe that it creates unnecessary tension and dissipates energy. It certainly dissipates resources. It tends to concentrate on statements and not on the needs of the other children who fall short of needing a statement.
<P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para91"></a>I am also concerned about those who are philosophically opposed to specialist schools providing for children with special educational needs. I do not believe that we should have a philosophical hang-up either way. We should focus policy on the appropriate provision for children with special educational needs whatever they may be.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para92"></a>The IPSE point is very well taken; it is to make the distinction between those children who are failed by the system simply because the LEA, the school, the teacher or someone in the system is disobeying the law and those failed by the system because it needs reform. Those are two very different things.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para93"></a>I hope that the review will focus on the 20 per cent. As I understand it&#151;and I stand to be corrected&#151;it refers to the fact that at any given time approximately 20 per cent of children in the system need special attention. Two to 3 per cent will need continuous, almost lifetime, attention because they are at the severe end of young people with disabilities. But it also includes young people with a temporary condition. It also includes children who simply did not learn to read early enough. It includes children who received poor teaching early on and those with parents and families who did not work in concert with the school. Therefore, there are innovative ways of looking at how some of the needs of quite a large part of the 20 per cent could be met.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para94"></a>The other issue is exclusions. One sees some very depressing statistics. The vast majority of young people excluded from our schools are children who have special educational needs. Very often they are needs which have not been identified and where there has not been effective attention.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para95"></a> I agree with my noble friend Lord Lucas that teachers deserve to be trained better to identify special educational needs. Quite a number of them could be dealt with in the classroom. My right honourable friend Iain Duncan Smith, and my honourable friends Damian Green and Eleanor Laing in another place, who is responsible for special educational needs, held a conference six months ago with all interested parties. They said much the same as we are saying now. They certainly would have supported much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para96"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that yesterday my honourable friend Eleanor Laing went to see a Mencap project in Birmingham. I believe it was called The Transaction Project. It is a pilot project where young teenagers without special educational needs are brought together with young people with such needs. They are learning ways in which to make the transition from teenager to adult life more straightforward and effective. She was extremely impressed with the project.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para97"></a>In summary, a fundamental review is timely and I hope that that can be supported. I believe that there is scope for improvement in the delivery of the current provisions and that more attention should be given towards obeying the law. The noble Baroness is right. In 1981, 1993, 1996 and in 2002, we passed legislation. However, there are two serious problems with it. One <P>


<a name="column_1216"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is that a policy of inclusion is very expensive, and to resource it would create great tension. The other is that the law is frankly being ignored. Simply passing law does not make the system any better.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para98"></a>There should be a fundamental review, an improvement in the delivery of current provision and more research, especially into what works. To pick up a point made by the right reverend Prelate, there should be more research into what we would define as good practice. First, the research should say what good practice is, and, once that has been identified, it should be disseminated. We also need more research into autism and related conditions.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para99"></a>The right reverend Prelate also made a point about the exploration of greater flexibility. There are many ways to meet the special educational needs of the young people concerned. We should have many more structures in schools, such as separate units, clustering children and using learning centres. All sorts of ways can be explored; we could do more. We should certainly improve teacher training.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para100"></a>Whatever the outcome of the review, however long it takes, and whatever comes at the end of the exercise, early identification and effective early intervention will always be the key to addressing special educational needs of young people. We thank the noble Baroness for the opportunity to discuss an absolutely fundamental subject.

<A NAME="30129-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, I too thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for initiating the debate, for the work that she has done, and for her on-going work with dyslexia. I associate myself with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about this House. I also say that I have never thought of the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, as fuddy-duddy, which is how I think that she referred to herself.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para101"></a>I want to begin by putting on record what we mean by children with special educational needs. I am fully aware that the expertise in the House at present means that that may be unnecessary, but it means children who require additional or different help, in order to access the curriculum and to make progress, from the provision normally available in maintained mainstream schools in their area.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para102"></a>I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that my figures&#151;they correlate well with what she said&#151;state that about 16.8 per cent of children with special needs do not have statements, and have their needs met by their schools with occasional help from local education authorities. I hope that figure clarifies that point.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para103"></a>The committee of inquiry that the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, chaired in the late 1970s laid the foundations for the statutory framework for special educational needs. We have built on that framework, most recently through the changes introduced by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. The purpose of the 2001 Act was to broaden access and <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity for children with special needs and disabilities by giving them a stronger right to mainstream places in schools, where that is appropriate, and extending the Disability Discrimination Act to education.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para104"></a>I agree with all noble Lords that now is a good time to take stock of where we have reached, and to consider what steps we can take to improve support further for children and young people with special needs and disabilities, and, in doing so, for their families as well.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para105"></a>The Audit Commission's recent report, referred to by most noble Lords, is timely. It provides an overview of the key issues and recognises the action that the Government are already taking. It highlights how, as said by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, implementing some of the statutory processes can be time-consuming and bureaucratic. However, it acknowledges the assurance that they offer parents, and that they are the safety net referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Darcy de Knayth and Lady Blatch.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para106"></a>We believe that the statementing process offers assurance not only to parents, but to schools in helping them plan and make provision. We recognise the value that it has in ensuring that severe or complex needs are carefully assessed.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, supported by some noble Lords including the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, argued for a wide-ranging review of the statutory framework for special needs. I do not believe that making further changes to the legislative framework at this time is the right way forward. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, we must ensure that the new changes have time to bed down, and we must evaluate their impact. As the right reverend Prelate said, we need to look at the sharing of good practice and ensure that we focus on what the practical measures are to help our schools&#151;that was referred to by every noble Lord who spoke. We must also look carefully at the role of and support for local education authorities and their partners in order to improve the quality of provision for children with special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para108"></a>However, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that there is a focus on the statementing process; some parents see that as the only option available. We all desire a better system that addresses that issue.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para109"></a>We announced in answer to a question from the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in December an SEN action programme. The purpose of the programme will take forward some of the work that is already under way and address many of the areas highlighted in the Audit Commission report and by noble Lords this evening. All of the action areas that we will examine have been mentioned this evening. They include: earlier identification of special educational needs and early intervention; the co-ordination of education, health and social services; support for schools in meeting diverse needs, including managing <P>


<a name="column_1218"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>behaviour, autism, dyslexia and dyscalculia; the attainment and achievement of children with special needs; and their transitions to further education, work and adult life. The programme will consider the future role of special schools. It will include measures designed to enable schools and local education authorities to develop their arrangements for monitoring performance and sharing effective practice. We will be consulting widely on its development and hope to publish it later this year.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para110"></a>A number of noble Lords discussed the complex issues of early identification. I wholeheartedly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that we stand a much better chance of addressing the needs of children with special needs if we identify those needs early on. Despite what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, we are investing heavily in ensuring that we do so. We already have a £25 million package in place to provide special needs co-ordinator support, SEN training and experts for early years settings. Moreover, there is £3 million to support early years development and childcare partnerships for low incidence special needs; that rises to £8 million next year. We are also promoting good practice through Together from the Start, which is guidance for professionals on identifying the needs of disabled children aged nought to two and co-ordinating services for their families. There is also an early support programme to test out the principles of the guidance and related guidance on early intervention for children with hearing impairments and their families. It is being piloted in 28 local areas. We want to evaluate those programmes but they are essential tools to ensure that we have the early intervention that we want.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para111"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that early intervention is essential and critical. Within the SEN code of practice, we must ensure that we offer appropriate guidance to our early education settings. We have a range of materials to help teachers to support pupils with special needs. That is being provided through the national literacy and numeracy strategy. They are important developments, but I agree with all who said that there is more that we need to do. We want to put this at the heart of our Sure Start programme. We recognise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, the value of the Home Start programme. We also recognise that we need to look at issues of childcare for families with disabled children and ensure that our childcare provision is able to assess children with special educational needs and ensure that those needs are met. We hope to provide family support for those children in the children's centres that will be developed to ensure that those children get the best that they can.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para112"></a>A number of noble Lords rightly indicated the need for better integration and co-ordination of education, health and social care. I say to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, that I agree completely that regular contact with mental health professionals is an essential part of that. We are working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services can work as close to schools as possible. We know that for parents getting help to meet their <P>


<a name="column_1219"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children's needs can be very frustrating. They want the professionals to be integrated and joined up. For too long we expected families to join up the professionals, but we need to do that for them.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para113"></a>I also accept that we need to get better at recognising how the services can integrate. We are promoting a co-ordinated approach to the children's national service framework, which will set new national standards in health and social care and in links to education. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will be pleased that the national service framework, especially the strand on children with disabilities, is collecting data at last on those children.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para114"></a>When services are joined up we recognise that the benefits are enormous. Our communication aids pilot project, which offers fast-track assessment and access to ICTs for school-age children facing significant communication difficulties, illustrates what can be achieved. We hope that the children's trust pilots, announced yesterday, working in collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Health, will model local joined-up planning. They will enable services to be commissioned and delivered for children with special needs and disabilities across education, social care and health. We believe that that will answer some of the issues noble Lords have rightly raised.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para115"></a>Many noble Lords talked in detail about ensuring that we supported our children in meeting their diverse needs. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about increasing the diversity and range of provision by allowing schools to collaborate and do things differently, providing centres of excellence and so on. I will read with care their comments in Hansard to ensure that we are fully addressing those issues. We need to ensure that our teachers have access to the knowledge and resources that they require.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para116"></a>I did not completely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, when she said that schools have no incentive to support these children. Many schools support them incredibly well. But I agree that we must ensure that we have, for example, the right quantity and quality of speech therapists. We have been considering how to involve other professionals in providing ongoing speech therapy support, working closely with qualified speech therapists.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para117"></a>We offer training and support through the SEN Standards Fund, to which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Rix, referred. I recognise that we must give far more support to teaching assistants. I am in discussion with the Teacher Training Agency about how to improve the quality of training for teachers, recognising the issue of time and the importance of not taking teachers out of the classroom so much, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said. We are looking closely not only at teachers' training years, but also at their induction years.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para118"></a>I am also interested in ensuring that teachers have the opportunity to talk to each other, either through ICT in a virtual forum or in other ways, so that they can learn from each other. There are many teachers with many years' experience of working with children <P>


<a name="column_1220"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with special educational needs. That experience is locked up in their particular schools and I am keen to help new teachers or those new to a particular kind of special need to use that informal mentoring support, which can add a great deal to their work.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para119"></a>We often discuss whether we should give money directly to schools. I notice that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, is unsure about our putting money directly through to local authorities. Where schools have the resources&#151;going back to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas&#151;they are able to make choices, particularly for children who are not statemented. They can use the support that they are able to purchase with their own resources flexibly and effectively and in a way that will benefit such children, whom they may be unsure about classifying as having special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para120"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said, children come in and out of the system in terms of their special needs requirements, which needs to be recognised. I am concerned&#151;and noble Lords have raised this issue&#151;that we ensure that for low incidence or complex special educational needs resources are available at LEA level to move with the pupils so that their needs can be addressed. I hope that I shall have more to say on those issues as we develop the system.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para121"></a>Dyslexia and autism will feature prominently in the work that we do. Further work with national literacy and numeracy strategies will take account of the needs of children with special educational needs, and will offer a key means of support for children with dyslexia and dyscalculia. We have already provided targeted help for teachers.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para122"></a>I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Astor, that the Medical Research Council estimates that 60 per 10,000 children under eight have autistic spectrum disorders. We know that improvements in identification of ASDs mean that every school is likely to have a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. Seventy three per cent of parents who have been surveyed by the NAS said that they were satisfied with the education provision made for their children. That means, of course, that 27 per cent said that they were not satisfied.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para123"></a> I believe that we have to raise awareness of the issues of autism, Asperger's syndrome and the entire spectrum. We have to encourage the spread of good practice and to iron out the variations described by the noble Lord to promote greater consistency between schools and education authorities. We have published guidance, which has been welcomed. It is an important step forward. I was grateful to the noble Lord for supporting that. We are following it up with dissemination events, rather than just simply sending the guidance. We want to ensure that we have the opportunity to talk to teachers and schools about it.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para124"></a>We believe that a multi-agency approach, clear pathways of identification through diagnosis and early intervention are vital. We look forward to seeing the report from the national initiative on the identification and screening of autism, which will inform the autism exemplar under the national service framework for children. It will set national standards of provision for <P>


<a name="column_1221"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children with autism. I intend to pursue that issue. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising those issues and look forward to discussing with him further what more I can do.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para125"></a>Noble Lords talked about the high expectations that we need to have in raising attainment and achievement levels for children, and the need to recognise that many children with special needs achieve very well. They fulfil the full spectrum of educational ability. New data are coming on stream that will help us to learn more about children with special needs. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that we need a range of bench-marks to analyse the performance of children with special needs, some of whom will not reach the national targets.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para126"></a>I remind the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the purpose of key stage 2, level 4, is that we are confident that children can access the secondary curriculum effectively. It is important that we know where our children with special needs are. We have made some progress with the introduction of scales to measure the performance of children who are not expected to reach level 2. Guidance and target-setting for pupils operating at that level have been distributed. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that there is much more work to do in that area. We know that Ofsted inspections can be valuable. They are important, but we must also ensure that schools that are strong on inclusion and support do not feel disadvantaged by the performance tables. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said. We know that valued-added measures can help, but we have a long way to go. I shall be considering the matter carefully as part of the action programme.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para127"></a> I am not sure about the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, about SEN-friendly schools, partly because I think that all schools should be SEN-friendly. It is important, however, to recognise and celebrate their achievements, which I think is the point that the noble Lord was getting at.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para128"></a>I was pleased that a number of noble Lords raised the issue of the future of special schools. We are committed to a more inclusive society. We recognise that an inclusive education system is paramount to that. All children can benefit from an inclusive education. It is not only those with special needs or disabilities who can do so. Our policy is that children should be taught in mainstream schools when parents want it and it works for the child, the school and the other pupils. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that many disabled children thrive within that atmosphere. Increasingly children with special needs are being taught in mainstream schools. We are looking again at the more diverse range of provision.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para129"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford described a good example of co-location. That is something that I am keen to encourage. I pay tribute to the work of many of the Church of England schools in developing those new models. I am also aware of the links that the Star primary school has with special schools. I have not yet had the good fortune to visit the <P>


<a name="column_1222"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>school, but I have met the head teacher with the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. That is again something that we want to encourage.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para130"></a>I shall read what was said on 18th December and shall come back to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I say to him and the noble Baronesses, Lady Blatch and Lady Warnock, that there is a vital and continuing role for special schools as centres of expertise and as part of the community of schools, both special and mainstream, working together with other schools and other partners. It is crucial that noble Lords and noble Baronesses understand that that vital role is there.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para131"></a>I know that the inclusion agenda has made some of our special schools very unsure and unclear. Therefore, a few months ago I established a working group to help us to develop a clear vision of the future role of special schools, involving special schools. It focuses on the practical measures to support the role of special schools and to celebrate their achievements. It will present its report to us shortly and I shall be glad to come to your Lordships' House to discuss it with noble Lords. It will, of course, form a huge part of the action programme. I stress that special schools are critical and important. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that at present 11,000 children are in residential schools.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para132"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned the issue of children in care. We have deliberated on that subject many times. I say to the noble Earl that from next year&#151;2003&#150;04&#151;we shall introduce a new vulnerable children's grant, which amounts to £84 million, including matched funding from local education authorities. I believe that that will have some significant advantages for children in care, many of whom&#151;26 per cent&#151;have special needs, as the noble Earl knows.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para133"></a>I was delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, mentioned the issue of transition to adult life. We have the Social Exclusion Unit report, Bridging the Gap, and are looking to see what we can do within the 14-to-19 strategy. As noble Lords will be aware, Mike Tomlinson is advising us on this matter. We have 25 14-to-19 Pathfinder projects with a strong special educational needs focus. We shall ensure that we learn more about that.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para134"></a>I was interested in the proposal that secondary schools should be smaller. I shall be glad to pass on that idea to my honourable friend the Minister for Schools. Of course, I cannot comment on the Scottish system, but I watch it with great interest.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para135"></a>Finally, I agree that we must get better at monitoring performance and sharing effective practice. I believe that our special needs regional partnerships will make a difference to that work. I carry out a continual review to ensure that we work with our parent partnerships to support parents in finding their way through the system.
<P>

<a name="30129-10_para136"></a> Again, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, for introducing the debate. It has, as always, been extremely useful for me. I look forward to continuing the discussions and to doing more to support these children.

<P>

<a name="30129-10_para137"></a>I believe that we still need what is rather sadly called a "safety net", but we probably need it just as much for the non-statemented children as for those who have statements.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what is the comparative significance of the euro and the United States dollar to the United Kingdom economy.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I start by expressing my gratitude to noble Lords who are to speak in this debate on what may appear to be a fairly dense subject. I am particularly grateful that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is to reply for the Government because I share the great respect in which the noble Lord is held by all sides of the House. He is enormously admired for the volume, variety and complexity of the issues which he handles, and for the courteous, efficient and even humorous way in which he does so. But even the noble Lord is human, I think, and so on rare occasions&#151;on very rare occasions&#151;two of which I shall mention this evening, he can only be as accurate as the brief he has been given. And of course, he speaks for the Government, who view our membership of the European Union as an unquestionably good thing and who want to sign us up to European economic and monetary union just as soon as they can deceive the people into voting for it in a referendum.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para1"></a>So my purpose in bringing this Question before your Lordships this evening is to dispel two items of Europhile propaganda which lie at the heart of the question as to whether or not the United Kingdom should join EMU and which have a considerable bearing on whether or not we need to stay in the European Union at all. Those two Euro-myths are, first, that the euro is more significant to our economy than the US dollar, and, secondly, that some 60 per cent of our trade takes place with the euro-zone. This second Euro-myth has even been improved by Ministers for Europe and others to become,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"60 per cent of our trade depends on our membership of the European Union".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30129-11_para3"></a>The effect of this propaganda is vastly to exaggerate the importance of the euro to our economy as a whole, and to belittle our trading relationship with the United States of America. The intention of those who peddle <P>


<a name="column_1224"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is obviously to implant in the British people the fear that to leave the European Union would be economic suicide, and that they cannot afford to live for much longer without the euro either.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para4"></a>Let me start with the first proposition, that the euro is more significant to our economy than the US dollar. At first sight this is so unlikely that one wonders how the Europhiles dare to put it forward, but they do with monotonous regularity. I regret to say that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is guilty of having done so in your Lordships' House at least twice in the past year, although, as I have indicated, I am sure he did so in good faith personally. For instance, on the 26th February last year, the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, suggested that the sterling-dollar exchange rate was more important to us than the sterling-euro rate because the UK trades more in dollars than in euros and because we do a greater percentage of our trade in dollars than does the euro-zone. To this eminently sensible and accurate suggestion, I fear that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, replied as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Lords, the Bank of England basket of currencies and exchange rates calculated on that basis shows that the euro is more significant than either the dollar or the yen and represents more than half of our trade. I am therefore afraid that the noble Lord is not correct in his initial premise".&#151;[Official Report, 26/2/02; col. 1315.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30129-11_para6"></a> I fear that the noble Lord did it again two days later on 28th February 2002 when I suggested that he had got it wrong on 26th February and that in fact some 60 per cent of our foreign trade was transacted in dollars. At this the noble Lord stuck to his guns, or rather his brief, and informed the House:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As for the euro's share in our overseas transactions, it comprises 65 per cent of the Bank of England sterling exchange rate index, whereas the US dollar comprises only 16.5 per cent of the index".&#151;[Official Report, 28/2/02; col. 1527.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30129-11_para8"></a>The trouble is, as I tried to point out to the House later on in the same Starred Question, at col. 1529, that the Bank of England's exchange rate index is an entirely useless tool if we want to unearth the truth about the relative importance to our economy of the euro and the dollar. This is because that index excludes services and investment income, and covers only exports of manufactured goods, which amount to well under half of all UK exports. It also uses geographical breakdowns of trade which ignore actual currency usage; it excludes large areas of the world in which UK trade is significant; and it relies on data which are over 10 years old, from 1989 to 1991. So I trust we can forget the Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index for the purpose of this debate.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para9"></a>I am sure there are other ways of measuring the importance to our economy of the euro and the dollar, but I put a pretty authoritative one in front of your Lordships tonight. That is to be found in the Government's own publication, The United Kingdom Balance of Payments, known colloquially as the "Pink Book". There we find, for instance, the Government's figures on UK exporters' usage of the dollar and the euro as a currency of invoicing. The "Pink Book" tells us that for the year 2000&#151;and I gather 2001 is not much different&#151;UK exports amounted to some £413 billion. That figure includes exports not only of <P>


<a name="column_1225"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>manufactured goods, but of services as well, together with investment income and transfers. So it is a total export figure, which I trust noble Lords will agree is what we ought to be talking about, not just exports of manufactured goods, important as they may be.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para10"></a>Of that £413 billion, some £142 billion, or 35 per cent, was invoiced in dollars, and only £91 billion, or 22 per cent, was invoiced in euros. The remaining £180 billion, or 44 per cent, was invoiced in other currencies, the overwhelming majority of which was of course in sterling. So on this basis dollar usage by British exporters was at least 1.6 times euro usage, which leads one easily to the conclusion that the dollar was at least 50 per cent more significant than the euro to the British economy.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para11"></a>I turn to the second Euro-myth which I wish to demolish tonight. This is that some 60 per cent of our trade takes place with the EU, or that 60 per cent of our trade depends upon our membership of the European Union. Here again, the purpose of the propaganda appears to be to frighten people into thinking that that trade and the 3 million or so jobs that support it might somehow be lost if we left the EU and/or will be put at risk if we do not join EMU. That is such obvious nonsense that I trust that I do not need to waste your Lordships' time by exposing it as such. The trade would go on, and so would the jobs.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para12"></a>Any noble Lord who doubts that does not have to believe a confirmed Eurosceptic such as me. Instead, he can read the report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research&#151;not at all a Eurosceptic organisation&#151;published in February 2000 and entitled, A Continent Cut Off? The Macro-economic Impact of British Withdrawal from the European Union. Or he could read the report of August 2000 to the US Congress by the International Trade Commission, perhaps the most prestigious economic think-tank in the world.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para13"></a> So whatever is the percentage of our trade with the EU and however many jobs support it, none of it would be lost if we leave the EU or do not join the currency. But what is that percentage? The difficulty is that when Europhiles say that 60 per cent of our trade takes place with the EU, they really mean that 60 per cent of our exports of manufactured goods go to other EU countries. In this context, the word "trade" has come to mean "exports of manufactured goods". Of course, that is grossly deceptive. If we were to join EMU, that would affect the whole of our economy, which is already affected by all the debilitating regulations that pour forth from the corrupt octopus in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para14"></a>So we must consider the question from the standpoint of the whole of our economy. If we use the word "trade" in this context, it must mean all of our trade, not just less than half of our exports. The only honest question therefore becomes: what proportion of the whole of our economy is involved in trade with the EU? If we stand back to consider the whole of our economy, we begin to get the true picture. That is that about 80 per cent of our economic activity takes place right here in the United Kingdom, in the British <P>


<a name="column_1226"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>domestic economy; only 20 per cent goes in exports at all. Of that 20 per cent, less than half&#151;or less than 10 per cent of the whole&#151;goes to the EU.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para15"></a> I am not an economist and I do not pretend that even the experts find it easy to measure an economy or to agree precisely what proportion goes where. For instance, there are at least three accepted ways to measure the export of goods and services. They are: as a proportion of total consumption; as a proportion of gross domestic product; and as a proportion of what is known as final demand. According to Government figures from the Office for National Statistics, exports of goods and services to the EU amount to only 5.3 per cent of total consumption; 12.3 per cent of GDP; and 9.6 per cent of final demand. Of those, the ONS selects the latter measure, final demand, to show the relative weights of various sectors of the economy, so it is surely reasonable that we should do likewise and take rather less than 10 per cent as the proportion of our economy that goes in exports of goods and services to the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para16"></a>So the big picture, the true picture, is that rather less than 10 per cent of British activity is involved in exporting to the EU. None of that will be lost if we do not join EMU, or even if we leave the EU altogether.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para17"></a>Given the complexity of the subject, I propose to place two one-page briefing notes from Global Britain in the Library, in case any noble Lord wants to relish further the supporting detail for what I have said. I must of course declare an interest as one of the founders of Global Britain, together with the noble Lords, Lord Harris of High Cross and Lord Stoddart of Swindon, who I am delighted to see in their places. I must also place on record my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, who, after our exchanges last February, encouraged dialogue between Treasury and Bank of England officials and the Director of Global Britain, Ian Milne, and of the British Management Data Foundation, Tony Cowgill, who also advises me.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para18"></a>The briefing notes that I shall place in the Library are No. 21, entitled Exposure of the UK Economy to the Dollar and the Euro, and No. 22, entitled 90% of the British Economy is not Involved in Exports to the EU. I trust that they may help to inform public debate as the convention in Brussels moves to its momentous conclusions and as we approach the next and perhaps final intergovernmental conference. In the meantime, I hope that we shall hear no more of the claim that the euro is more important to us than the dollar, or that 60 per cent of our total trade is in any way associated with our membership of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para19"></a>I end with only one question to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. If less than 10 per cent of our economy is involved in trade with the EU, and if even that&#151;or a somewhat larger figure&#151;will not be lost if we do not join EMU, why do we even contemplate giving up 100 per cent of our currency to Brussels and Frankfurt? I repeat my thanks to other noble Lords who are to speak, especially at this late hour, and look forward to hearing their contributions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the Question on the Order Paper of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, depends on which way we are looking. If we look backwards in time, it is obvious that the US dollar has been of unique importance to the United Kingdom economy. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, on that.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para20"></a>With the demise of sterling under the burden of financing the last war, the dollar became the world's principal trading and reserve currency. Commodities became priced and traded in dollars, and the Bretton Woods arrangements confirmed the global supremacy of the dollar. With the UK economy's dependence on foreign trade, managing the relationship between sterling and the dollar has been of critical importance to successive British governments over the past 50 years.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para21"></a>If, on the other hand, we look forward in time, we have to consider two scenarios. The first is one in which the UK remains outside the euro. In those circumstances, the importance of the euro to the UK economy is likely to grow in significance from&#151;I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson&#151;a lowish base at present and may well come in time to rival that of the dollar. It is likely to involve a delicate balancing act between the two.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para22"></a>If, however, sterling does become part of the euro, then the answer to the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is simple: the dollar will undoubtedly be the most significant currency relationship for the euro-land economy, as it is already.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para23"></a>But the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is not really about currency relationships but about creating arguments as to why we should not join the euro. The noble Lord's views on Europe are well known to your Lordships and we have heard them again today. I do not share them. I am one of those who have long supported the European adventure and Britain's full participation in it. I believe in the desirability of building a genuine single market in Europe. I do not believe that a genuine single market can be achieved without a single currency. Britain should be part of it, although the timing of our entry is critical and it may be best left until the current political and economic uncertainties are somewhat reduced.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para24"></a>The potential benefits to the UK economy of joining the euro are much more than simply giving transparency to pricing differentials across the Union and the convenience of common notes and coins saving conversion costs and currency risks. A more macro economic benefit is the reduced exposure of the whole economy to exchange rate fluctuations. At present, about 40 per cent of UK GDP is in foreign trade, compared with around 14 per cent for euro-land as a whole and around 11 per cent for the United States. Foreign trade is thus less important in the euro-land economy and the economy is less exposed to external trends. The domestic economy becomes paramount, as it is already in the United States for that reason.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30129-11_para25"></a>In Europe we are creating a domestic market of 350 million, rising to 500 million, people. This represents a massive pool of savings available for the financing of enterprise and, particularly, of research and development, all this contributing to the availability of cheap capital resources. The euro could also come to rival the dollar as an international reserve currency, providing euro-land with still further resources.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para26"></a> A single, seamless market in financial services, which we certainly have not yet created, means that private and institutional investors and pension funds would have a much wider choice of equity and fixed interest investment, free of exchange risk, from which to choose.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para27"></a>I believe that these are all fairly substantial potential benefits. But there are, of course, risks. I do not wish to deny that. Such a linking of currencies between nations has not been attempted before. But, in my view, the risks are worth taking.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para28"></a>We learnt from bitter experience in this country in the last century that printing money is a great temptation to politicians. We learnt that competitive currency devaluation is no recipe for economic salvation. Britain within the euro would mean four world currencies&#151;the euro, the dollar, the yen and probably the Chinese renminbi. Capital flows would increasingly dominate the rates of exchange between the four blocs and might well cause unwanted distortions and volatility.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para29"></a>Therefore, if, as we all hope, the euro experiment proves to be a success, I believe that later in this century we may see moves to create a single world currency. It is late at night, my Lords, so this may be just a dream.

<A NAME="30129-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I rise with considerable timidity to contribute to the debate on this important subject, which was opened by my noble friend Lord Pearson with characteristically well informed and powerful argumentation.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para30"></a>One reason that I speak with such timidity is that this is the first time that I have participated in a debate in your Lordships' House on the European Union. I was prompted to do so because I have listened to or read many of the previous debates on this subject, which has such momentous significance, and have become increasingly concerned. One of the reasons for this concern has been the asymmetry between the detailed and compelling evidence and arguments put forward again and again by those who may be designated Euro-sceptics, such as the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart of Swindon and Lord Bruce of Donington, and my noble friends Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Pearson of Rannoch.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para31"></a>By contrast, the responses of Her Majesty's Government and their Euro-enthusiast supporters have often seemed less convincing. They have at times seemed deficient in their lack of detailed counter-argument and evidence. What is worse, argument has at times been replaced by derision, leading me to suspect that the Euro-sceptics have the stronger case.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para32"></a>This has prompted me to do some homework, and my concerns have developed into a tentative commitment to the Euro-sceptic position. My contribution is therefore my first test of the validity of my perception, and I shall listen with deep interest to the Minister's reply to the points raised by my noble friend and perhaps to my own exploratory contribution.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para33"></a>I begin with an historical perspective and parallel. It is generally accepted that Britain's return to a fixed exchange rate system in 1925 was disastrous. The fixed rate system in question was, of course, the gold standard. The locking-in of the pound to the currencies of Britain's major trading partners and competitors led ineluctably to the general strike of 1926, then to severe unemployment and its attendant hardships. Only when Britain left the gold standard in 1931 did her economy recover.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para34"></a>The story of that disastrous decision has been well told by the late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead in his magisterial biography of Churchill. In 1925, Churchill was Chancellor and Norman was Governor of the Bank of England. This is how Roy Jenkins told the story:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nearly all the bien-pensant sources of advice were unanimous that it was Britain's interest and duty to return to the Gold Standard . . . Churchill's minutes were masterpieces of pungent questioning whereas the replies took refuge in a misty higher wisdom . . . The direct replies to the Churchill minutes . . . were splendid examples of substituting superior wisdom for rational argument . . . Norman, the great Governor, was even more sublimely bland. In the opinion of 'educated and reasonable men' he wrote, 'there was no alternative to a return to Gold . . . if not the Chancellor will be abused by the instructed and posterity'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para35"></a>
Churchill lost the battle, as we know. Roy Jenkins went on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The momentum of conventional wisdom swept his support away . . . the whole story was a remarkable example of a strong not a weak minister nonetheless reluctantly succumbing . . . to the near unanimous, near irresistible flow of establishment opinion . . . [and] the ability of such a near unanimous concentration of advice to be wrong . . . as a result there was committed what is commonly regarded as the greatest mistake of that Baldwin government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para36"></a><P>

<a name="30129-11_para37"></a>The parallels with the present are obvious. Lord Jenkins was not only a distinguished Chancellor, he was a supporter of all things European. I cite the phrase about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "the ability of such a near unanimous concentration of advice to be wrong",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-11_para38"></a>
because it may hold lessons for the present debate about Britain's membership of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para39"></a>I shall leave discussion of the current short-term economics of Britain and the euro to colleagues far better qualified than I am. My focus is the longer term: the next 50 years. It is no use just looking at present-day economics, vital as they are, because joining the euro, as the Treasury quite rightly keeps on reminding us, is for all eternity. The decision we may be about to take must be the right one: not just for the next five months or five years, but also for the next 50 years at least.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para40"></a>What is the prognosis for the next 50 years? The European Commission has just hazarded a guess in its review of the EU economy in 2002 which came out just before Christmas. It predicts that by 2050 the current 15 EU members states' share of world output will have shrunk by 44 per cent, from their present 18 per cent to 10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para41"></a>Meanwhile, the United States' share of world output will increase from 23 per cent today to 26 per cent in 2050. One of the reasons for this projected divergence between the EU and the United States is the sharply contrasting demographic paths which each is predicted to follow. I shall cite projections produced by the United Nations Population Division, as they are probably as impartial and bias-free as any. Perhaps I may highlight some examples of the implications of projected demographic changes drawn from the Global Britain Briefing Note No. 18, entitled Demographic Change 2000&#150;2050.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para42"></a>The projected EU 15 over-60s population in 2050 is 53 per cent higher than today. However, the projected working-age population of the EU 15 in 2050 is 28 per cent lower overall than today&#151;a loss equivalent to the combined working populations of nine existing EU members: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para43"></a>Enlargement to include the 10 nominated first wave countries would exacerbate the overall percentage decline in working-age population. The position of other potential European candidates for accession&#151;for example, Bulgaria, Romania or Ukraine&#151;is even worse.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para44"></a>The economic and social implications of such projected demographic changes are far-reaching and disturbing. Time permits me only to highlight a few examples. First, at the geo-strategic level, the United States of America will become even more powerful than it is today, economically, militarily, politically and culturally. Europe and the EU will decline relatively, economically, militarily, politically and culturally.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para45"></a>Secondly, at the geo-economic level, growth in GDP, market size and equity returns will occur outside Europe whereas the EU single market will be a shrinking market, unattractive to foreign investors.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para46"></a>Thirdly, at the EU level, even with enlargement, the tax base will shrink; tax rates and debt will have to increase. Shrinking and ageing populations mean more demand for healthcare and pensions, with fewer people to provide them. Most EU member states will see falling demand for houses, schools, factories and shops, with falling asset values and investment. This will affect the financial and equity markets on which pension provision depends. Sharply diverging demographics within the EU will make EU-wide one size fits all policies even more inappropriate in many spheres&#151;monetary, tax, labour market, agricultural, asylum, immigration, environmental and so on.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para47"></a>In conclusion, the demography-induced fiscal and budgetary implications of joining EMU, and indeed of staying in the European Union at all, will grow even more alarming. Therefore, it follows, I believe, that no matter what the short-term economics of joining the euro may be, searching questions must be asked about the wisdom of this country tying its fortunes to a grouping&#151;the EU&#151;whose future looks so problematic. The Prime Minister says that our destiny is Europe, but the last three centuries tell a different story. From looking at the evidence, I can only conclude that our interests are more global now than at any time in our long history and it is far from self-evident that those interests point to ever-growing, greater integration with Continental Europe.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para48"></a>Does the Minister disagree with, or can he disprove, any of the figures I have presented; or does he disagree with the implications of those figures I have identified? I welcome any reassurances he can give which will assuage my concerns&#151;concerns which opinion polls show are now shared by a growing number of people throughout this country.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, first, I welcome the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, on the subject of Europe. We all listened to it with great interest and respect. It was knowledgeable and to the point. I sincerely hope that in the future we shall hear a great deal more from her on the subject. Secondly, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, for raising the issue and the manner in which he did so. Again, his speech was full of knowledge, statistics and good sound common sense. I support his praise for the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. The noble Lord is the rock on which the Government in this House stand. I do not know what they would do without him. He is so versatile. He can be tough; he can also be soft; and he is always polite. We are indeed grateful to him for the enormous work he puts into everything he does in this House.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para49"></a>I should like to pick up on one or two points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. The first relates to trade and jobs. It is repeated time and again by government spokesmen that 3 million jobs will be at risk if we do not do this or that, if we do not go into the euro and if we do not become further integrated into Europe. They are trying to frighten the people of this country into believing that they could lose 3 million jobs if we do not join the euro and scrap the pound. Of course, it is a nonsensical argument. It simply is not true. If 3 million jobs are at stake in this country, more than 3 million jobs are at stake throughout the other countries of the European Union. Those countries are just as dependent on their exports to us as we are to them. If all exports and imports stop, they would be at the losing end because they export more to us than we export to them. So the idea put abroad that our trade with Europe will cease simply and solely because we will not scrap the pound or do everything the Europeans want us to do simply does not make sense.
<P>


<a name="column_1232"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para50"></a>Indeed, our adverse balance of trade with the EU runs at about £4 billion per annum. If one translates that into jobs on a value added basis of, let us say, £15,000 per capita that means that we are 300,000 jobs in deficit. In other words, if we were not in the EU, we might very well have more jobs rather than fewer. I wish the Government would stop using this ridiculous argument. It has been used before. It was used during the only referendum held on whether we should join a Common Market, not a European Union. Again, it was bruited abroad that to save our jobs in the car industry, or any other industry, we must join the Common Market. Of course, that has not happened&#151;it has not worked, as we all know.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para51"></a>I remember Harold Macmillan saying that the reason why we had to join the Common Market was that British industry should feel the chill wind of competition. British industry&#151;he referred to the manufacturing industry&#151;has indeed received the chill wind of competition. Manufacturing industry has reduced from 32 per cent of GDP in 1972 to 18 per cent, and employs fewer than 4 million people. That is the result of what happened, so let us hear no more about the 3 million lost jobs.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para52"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, remarked, only 12 per cent of our GDP is involved in exports to Europe. That is why small businesses are not in favour of scrapping the pound. They fear what will happen if we scrap our pound, and scrap our control of our economy, and give them over to a bunch of bureaucrats in the European Central Bank and elsewhere in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para53"></a>The overall balance of payments deficit is sustained to a large degree by inward direct investment. Again, allowing for the Netherlands distortion, the largest part of that inward direct investment comes not from the EU but from the United States and Canada, which provide 58 per cent. The rest of the world, outside the EU, provides 17 per cent. Only 25 per cent comes from the EU.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para54"></a>If one considers the UK's investment in other countries, one finds the same thing. The United States and Canada receive 35 per cent of our investment overseas, the rest of the world 43 per cent, and the EU only 22 per cent. As the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, said, our trade with the rest of the world is very important and large&#151;but it is with the world, not simply with the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para55"></a>I should claim an interest as one of the founder members of Global Britain. Like the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, I shall put one of our briefing notes, giving details of inward direct investment, into the House Library.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para56"></a>We do not have to peer into the future to know what could happen if we were foolish enough to give up our currency and go for the euro. We have only to look at Germany, which once had the strongest and most vibrant economy in Europe. What is happening to Germany now? It is on the verge of recession. Production has increased by only 0.2 per cent, which means that Germany will go into recession very shortly. But Germany can do little about it because it <P>


<a name="column_1233"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not have control of its own currency. Things are going to get worse because of that. Just at the very moment when Germany needs a bit of a devaluation and just at the time when it needs its currency to reduce in value, it is going up in value. That will hurt Germany very much indeed because it depends very much on its exports and, of course, it will be more difficult to export because of the rising value of the euro which is the only currency it now has. That is an example of what could happen in this country if we lost control of our monetary policy, which would eventually lead to the loss of our fiscal policy as well. As I say, Germany needs an increase in the value of its currency, which is now the euro, like a hole in the head.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para57"></a>Finally, it has surely now become clear that scrapping the pound is not only about economics and finance but about the creation of a European superstate dominated by the great duumvirate, France and Germany, who have made their intentions very, very, very clear only this month. It really is time for the Government to re-examine their policy of "me tooism" and make a start by recognising that scrapping the pound means scrapping the UK's monetary and fiscal independence and would put our very existence as a nation at risk. It really is time not to mess about with the euro but to say no to it.

<A NAME="30129-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Pearson casts his Rannoch fly over deep waters of the lochs of Europe again and again. We must admire his persistence. Unlike many people, he is no turncoat.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para58"></a>I must begin my latest address on the European subject by reminding noble Lords opposite of the lengthy period of time when the Labour Party refused to send anyone to the European Parliament and was totally anti-European until the moment when it felt that there was a political benefit to be gained from Europe. At the time of the referendum I believe that the theme that was cast around was, "Britain in Europe: it is our business to be there". Those of us who were involved in trade and the financing of trade rather wished that the government had kept out of things because we could trade anywhere. We had all the mechanisms necessary and all we wanted was political stability.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para59"></a>I take your Lordships back to those days long ago when we had exchange control and the dollar premium and when we ourselves were perhaps the best in the world at calculating all that. That wonderful department in the Bank of England headed by Miss Hiscoth suddenly one day disappeared from view. All we looked for were stable currencies. We found that one of the biggest problems was sterling itself because sterling had become a reserve currency, possibly unwittingly and unwillingly in the post-Empire days. We found ourselves in conflict with the dollar while we were&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, pointed out&#151;still paying not for one world war but for two. We found ourselves stretched and pushed and we could not understand the movements of the eurodollar. That was due to the introduction of <P>


<a name="column_1234"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest equalisation tax in the United States which led to a pool of dollars being kept abroad to finance other people's trade.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para60"></a>Sterling in general had been used to finance a large chunk of trade world-wide, but as our world role fell back, and the instability of sterling became so desperate, fewer and fewer people used sterling for trade finance. Now we come to that strange thing, the ecu. When I was on the Council of Europe I used to support Sir Brandon Rhys Williams in his desire to introduce the europa. Your Lordships will recall that in Henry VII's or Henry VIII's time there was the first golden ecu of the sun and the ecu dore for financing trade. When we came to the re-introduction of the ecu, it was felt that it had certain political overtones. My colleagues in the banking world advised certain senior British officials. We proposed the introduction of the parallel ecu, which could be used for financing trade and the reserve currency against which other countries could set their benchmarks, including ourselves.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para61"></a>The policy of noble Lords opposite and of their Government is most confusing. Not one of the five tests which they would like to apply could work at the present time. We live in troubled times. We look at what may happen to people's savings, the stock market, and currency fluctuations. I recall as a young boy often being lectured by my great uncle, Stafford Cripps, who had the awful job of devaluing sterling for the first time. The currencies of the world would always find a level against each other against which people could calculate. It would be 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3. As noble Lords know well, the dollar is now one dollar to one euro. The relationship between the kilometre and the mile is exactly the same; a euro is two-thirds of a pound. These currency movements often stabilise and that is where we are at the moment.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para62"></a>I remind the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, of that most interesting time when we were on a committee together studying what would happen when oil ran out. I believe it was Select Committee B. We asked that if manufacturing industry disappeared, what was going to replace it. Someone said that if there were service industries, probably we would have to service someone else's manufactures. The fact is that today we do not manufacture anything. We assemble, or as some people have been known to say, we down-size and out-source and we put things together. We service and we service, and often we do not say please and thank you. Our manufacturing base has gone. We have shifted from having for nearly 100 years a surplus income from manufactures to having our first deficit. That deficit grows and grows.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para63"></a>To say that we should concentrate on linking our currency to one within the continent of Europe is strange at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will recall something he said some time ago. What happens when one tries to bring currencies together and not all parts of the economy come together? There are underlying pressures that do not emerge at first; they emerge later.
<P>


<a name="column_1235"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para64"></a> The pressures we face with are that most of the continent of Europe has already spent substantial amounts on infrastructure. They have roads and railways which work; they have hospitals and schools. We have fallen so far behind on capital investment for infrastructure that it would have a major impact if we tried to link our currency too closely to others at this time.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para65"></a>Another matter is the wonderful word "arbitrage" which only emerged when there were differences between currencies or prices. Our currency was no longer linked to gold so the Bank of England sold all the gold it possibly could. Now we find that the value of gold has shot up at an almost incredible rate. Had we retained it we would have been better off. No one believed that we would return to gold because we believed that there would be stabilisation within stock markets and that currencies would remain stable.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para66"></a>We also forgot that as different taxation demands, which are not harmonised, emerged within countries, so it became cheaper for every country to buy in a foreign currency particularly if they could do it gris or noir without being accused of speaking French. It is not a good idea to buy certain agricultural machinery in one country when you can buy it cheaper in another. We know the argument about motor cars.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para67"></a>These differences in prices are rising all the time and now also apply to food. This is due to pressures of differential levels of taxation, the burden placed on employment or to the restriction on wages and the requirement to create better benefits and shorter working weeks. The differences between the countries are greater than they have ever been. My old friend Sir Basil de Ferranti worked hard on the question of non-tariff barriers. We have so many of them at the moment, which is unbelievable, but very few are legal.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para68"></a>What do governments do? They seek to govern by rules and regulations and it is those regulations themselves which are now starting to throttle large chunks of our own commercial sector, which in general is extremely honest.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para69"></a>I find it very interesting at this moment, and of particular importance, that the wild boar shooting season came to an end yesterday, I believe. The wild boar has suddenly become rather intelligent and does not get shot so often, so there has been a lower puntering of wild boar this year than ever before on the continent of Europe. Yet there are more and more of them.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para70"></a>What most people deem important to them is their way of life. I carry ecus and use ecus. There is no problem about a British company invoicing in ecus, dollars or anything else. It only needs a little calculator, which people can buy and have no worries. What concerns people is that, if we are in a scene with the potential of war, we do not have stability, and instability breeds fear. It is also a happy hunting ground for the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. If he keeps promoting his ideas, he will find a time when he will be <P>


<a name="column_1236"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1236</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30129-11_para71"></a>I was driven to take part with one purpose only, which was to underline something that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said in quoting the late Lord Jenkins's quite excellent biography of Winston Churchill. He recounts that in 1925 the great man, against his own judgment and yielding to the predominant expert opinion, restored the pound to its pre-1914 value. I think that I recall from student days that that was 4.866 recurring dollars. Among the results, as she said, were the general strike, record unemployment and so on, which were not relieved until 1931, when a so-called coalition government devalued the pound from that level to something a shade over four dollars to the pound.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para72"></a>The trouble with the euro is that the initially fixed rate is, as the noble Baroness said, for ever. The possibility of a later adjustment to meet changing circumstances is completely ruled out. When we contemplate joining, it is no consolation to me to think that the Germans in particular, and also the unhappy Irish, are now themselves suffering from a false rate of exchange between their natural currency&#151;in Germany's case the mark&#151;and the euro. They cannot change that rate of exchange and it dooms Germany, at least for the foreseeable future, to unemployment, retarded growth and all the other associated miseries. I believe that that logic reinforces the lesson that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has raised tonight.

I think that we are all grateful to him for raising the issues because he makes us think about fundamentals. The only snag is that I had some difficulty in following part of his argument.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para73"></a>Let us start with the background of our trade in goods and services. I shall take the figures from the Pink Book as I have them for 2001, which show that our exports to the Euro 12 were 50 per cent of our trade, with 3 per cent added for Sweden and Denmark. That makes the total for the EU 53 per cent. In comparison, the United States was 17 per cent, so we start with the proposition that our trade with the rest of the European Union is at least three times as much as that with the United States. The others are divided in different places.

<P>

<a name="30129-11_para74"></a>This matter is important because the impact of a single trade area is considerable, especially if it is fortified by a single currency. The single currency means that trade is increased. For example, it is interesting that when there is no single currency, as between Canada and the United States, the average Canadian province trades 20 times as much with another Canadian province which is equidistant and about the same size as it does with one of the states of the United States because there is not the same currency. If one compares that with the figures for the European Union, one finds, for example&#151;I take my figures from Eurostat&#151;that in 2001, France's trade with other EU countries was more than 30 per cent and that the same was true of Germany, whose figure was 32 per cent. In both cases, the amount of trade has increased since the euro was introduced. In the case of the United Kingdom, our share of trade with other EU countries as a proportion of GDP has slightly declined since the euro was introduced, from 23.2 per cent to 22.8 per cent. Trade tends to be increased in a single currency area.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para75"></a>Despite the vagaries from time to time in currencies, there seems little doubt that if one is a member of a single currency, there is greater stability of the currency itself. For example, in the years between 1985 and 2003, taking the value in 1990 as 100, the pound was as high as 110 in 1985 but by 1995 it had gone right down to 88; now it is back to 110 again. If we had been in a single currency at the time, figures show that the variation would have been very much less. In 1985, we would have been at the ratio of 88, for example, to the deutschmark and the same relation to the deutschmark would have been 92 today; however, the period between 1991 and 1998 would have been 100. Inside a single currency area, it is likely that the pound would have been much more stable.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para76"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, referred to the fact that more of our trade is invoiced in dollars than in euros. The figures that I take from Customs and Excise show that about 44 per cent of trade is invoiced in domestic currency, 32 per cent in dollars and 20 per cent in euros. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, draws from that the conclusion that therefore the dollar matters more. That appears to be the most elementary error. The question is about the stability of the domestic currency in relation to its customers. If I sell in pounds&#151;or, for that matter, in euros or dollars&#151;the question is: what will the goods be worth when I get paid? That is particularly important in the case of long-term deliveries.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para77"></a>The issue at stake is: what is the relationship and the exchange rate stability in terms of our currency and our top customers? There is no doubt that the biggest currency, whichever currency it is financed in, is that of the European Union. Dollar invoicing is irrelevant from that point of view. The point is: what is the stability relationship between our currency and our most important customers? The euro is now the currency of our most important customers. Floating has not had the advantages that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, suggested. The deutschmark has varied <P>


<a name="column_1238"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from 3.32 deutschmarks to the pound in 1989, down to 2.22 in 1995, back again to 3.30 and now it is again dropping.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para78"></a>Another real question is: what do outsiders think? What is the view of those who invest in Britain? The Japanese do not invest in Britain in order to export to the United States; they invest in Britain in order to export to Europe. Sales in Britain are relatively limited. American investors do not invest in the UK in order to export to the United States; they invest in the UK as a base for Europe. The same applies to German and French investment in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para79"></a>The United Kingdom may have certain special advantages, but if currency relations put them at a disadvantage because of instability, that investment will decline. It takes time; these things do not happen overnight. But the effect of our exclusion from the eurozone is becoming apparent. To take Eurostat figures, in the period 1997&#150;98 when the euro effectively began, foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom as a share of the total investment in the European Union was 52 per cent. In the period 1999&#150;2001 it dropped to 24 per cent. In 2001, foreign direct investment in the Netherlands was higher than in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30129-11_para80"></a> There are also signs of UK firms relocating outside the United Kingdom. The Japanese have made it clear that if we do not join the euro there will be no more investment in the United Kingdom.

<A NAME="30129-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will know that Honda has a great factory in Swindon. It has recently said that it does not matter what happens with the plan; it is going to stay there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, the position has been made clear by Toyota and Honda: as far as they are concerned there will be no further investment in the UK if we do not join the euro.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para0"></a>Foreign investment is important for a number of reasons. There are three main arguments for the euro: stability, to which I have referred; competition, which has often been argued about; and foreign direct investment, on which I shall concentrate. It is not only a question of jobs and the enormous contribution it makes to our exports, but the most important factor is its impact on the efficiency of management. Multinational companies are far more efficient than domestic companies, largely because they face tougher competition. They give a lead on productivity and innovation&#151;one only has to look at the number of patents obtained.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para1"></a>Foreign direct investment has had an enormous beneficial impact on this country. If we stay outside the European Union and the eurozone the figures demonstrate, as clearly as figures can demonstrate anything, that investment from abroad will suffer. It will affect our productivity and prosperity. If the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, were to be followed, the United Kingdom would be much the poorer.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch has done a great service by enabling us to have this short debate on an issue of vital importance. We can only touch parts of the picture in the time available, but it has been a good debate. If I may add a personal note, it has been a good debate so far for the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, considering all the nice things that have been said about him. I hope that nothing that will be said in the final few minutes will upset that record.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para2"></a>As always with these issues and the underlying issue about the virtues or otherwise of euro membership, opinion is divided. It is divided in this House; among the captains of industry&#151;although it seems to be tilting a little against at the moment; among the general public&#151;although again the tilt is away; and among the media, some of which take one view and some another. One of the fascinating events of the past few weeks is the sign that the pink one, the Financial Times, has become distinctly more middling and less committed to the idea that it is vital to join the euro soon. That is a fascinating trend.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para3"></a> My noble friend Lord Selsdon and other noble Lords rightly made the point that we are trying to look at this one issue, although it is not a narrow issue, in the great economic sea against a background of enormous turbulence in the world economy. A vast recession is gathering force and, as everyone knows, the world's stockmarkets have a long way down to go.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para4"></a>Here in the UK, not only stocks, but house prices are far too high and are bound to crash. Budgets throughout Europe and the world are going awry. Huge trade deficits are building up in America to unsustainable levels. We have also had our share of enormity in our trade deficit. Trying to look at the issue of the euro, its virtues and positioning in our trade against that type of background, is like trying to row a small boat in a sea with enormous waves and with much bigger ones to come.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para5"></a>Every economist who tries to be objective knows that the famous five tests to which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will no doubt refer, as he often does when answering questions in the House, cannot be unambiguous and clear. Every senior Treasury official&#151;the people right at the top of the thinking apparatus of Government&#151;has said that they are bound to be ambiguous and bound not to be clear. That is the nature of economics. We cannot possibly assume that even if the tests are carried out, they will be more than momentarily valid. What looks like convergence one day does not the next. That is the case in normal times, but it is even more so at present.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para6"></a>I may sound a little sceptical in general, aside from the sin or otherwise of Euroscepticsm, if I say that this is about the attempt to apply the so-called science of economics, which it is not, to the heaving changing scene. In my view&#151;and I had the temerity to write a book on the subject&#151;all economic statistics based on national aggregates are extremely dangerous and extremely unreliable, especially in the hands of political amateurs.
<P>


<a name="column_1240"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para7"></a>Nevertheless, having said all that, I shall now go into reverse and try to hang on to some specific facts that have come out of the debate. Fact number one, raised by my noble friend Lord Pearson, is the Customs and Excise official currency of invoice figures applied to the currency denominations of our trade. I am using the word "trade" in the broad sense of earning moneys from overseas by export and paying moneys overseas for imports of services, goods and other items&#151;our overseas transactions in other words.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para8"></a>One would have to be almost a nihilist to deny that 32 per cent of UK trade is denominated in dollars, 20 per cent in euros and the rest in sterling and other currencies. There are less official views, some of which are put out by the organisation referred to by my noble friend Lord Pearson, that put the figure much higher. One has to take into account many commodities, including oil, that are priced in dollars. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, rightly asked whether that was a relevant factor.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para9"></a>The figures are 32 per cent and 20 per cent, which appears to contradict the famous&#151;I was tempted to say notorious&#151;answers of 26th and 28th February last year when he said at column 1527 on the 28th that the US dollar comprises only 16.5 per cent of overseas transactions.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para10"></a>It must be a puzzle for the observer or spectator that there are two such contradictory perceptions. Not for one nanosecond would I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was misleading the House. He is far too upright, assiduous and nice&#151;well, most of the time&#151;to go down that road. He would perhaps concede that somewhere up the briefing chain there was some misleading done by those who advise in dragging out the trade weighted sterling index as the guide to the general assessment of the importance of dollar trade versus euro trade or trade in other currencies. I believe that the figure of 16.5 per cent fails to convey completely the reality of the situation. As my noble friend Lord Pearson and others have pointed out, the TWSI covers only trade in goods. It excludes large areas of the world and is hopelessly out of date.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para11"></a>The fact is that manufacturing in the modern world&#151;the making by hand of physical objects&#151;first, accounts for less than half the UK external payments. Secondly, again, as some of us have tried to point out in the past, the whole concept of identifying a different area of the economy called "manufacturing" is probably out of date. Vast parts of the so-called "manufacturing economy" are in fact services, technology and software, and large parts of the software and service industry include the structure of physical objects and manufacture. The matter is vastly confused, and I believe that our statisticians do us no service by clinging to these outdated definitions of the catallactic of industrial activity. However, we must live with it. That is the first point to have come out of the debate.
<P>


<a name="column_1241"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para12"></a>There appears to be a complete conflict, and I believe that we must accept that either the trade weighted sterling index is not a very good guide or that the Customs and Excise official currency of invoice has simply got it wrong. I do not believe the latter. I am sure that, looking back at his remarks last year, we would all like to hear how the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, now sees the situation.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para13"></a>The other issue that has come up&#151;a vast range of issues is connected with our debate tonight and we cannot begin to debate them all&#151;is the question of volatility, which is related to the question of dollar denominations of trade. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, referred to that, as did the noble Lord, Lord Taverne.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para14"></a>I believe that we know one or two facts rather than statistical opinions. We know that, against the dollar, in recent times sterling has been the most stable of all currencies. Indeed, this morning the Daily Telegraph&#151;not always the most reliable newspaper, but in words which sound to me reasonably objective&#151;states that, while other currencies fluctuate, measured by its trade-weighted average, which is surely the most objective way to judge its international value, the pound has hardly budged for years. It is, in short, one of the world's most stable currencies. That appears to be the record in a time of extreme turbulence. It is a time when, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, reminded us, the euro has been way down and way up and we are probably heading into a period when the dollar will slide away.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para15"></a>Secondly, with regard to the issue of volatility, we have the extremely remarkable and learned report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, as has already been mentioned. It comes from Christopher Taylor, who is the former chief adviser to the European division of the Bank of England. The report repays study because it casts enormous light on the issues on which we are trying to focus this evening.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para16"></a>Mr Taylor's three most important conclusions out of a very learned and detailed paper are that, first, sterling has, always has had and is bound to have dual affinities to the euro and to the dollar. He sees the prospect of more polarisation between the euro and the dollar and believes that maintaining those affinities will become more of an aching, stretching job even than it has been in the past.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para17"></a>Secondly, he speaks of the likelihood of greater volatility of the euro against the dollar as time goes by. Thus, if we are riding the euro horse, we shall be rocked around against the dollar far more than we have been over the past few years.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para18"></a>Thirdly, he establishes that, when the split in trade between the euro and the rest of the world includes services and investment income, the figures are 48 per cent for the European Union and 52 per cent for the rest of the world. He goes into that in such detail that I honestly do not believe there is much point in arguing further about the precise percentages because they are very closely around those levels.
<P>


<a name="column_1242"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para19"></a>Mr Taylor's conclusion is that if we become euro members, volatility will only marginally reduce&#151;that has been one of the main arguments of the supporters&#151;and could, depending on a number of factors, worsen. Those appear to be the two hot issues of the debate. Many others have been raised, including foreign investment flows and the Japanese, which I would like to debate with the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, at another time, because in the words of Ernest Bevin, "I have heard different".
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para20"></a>What we have heard tonight is important. If there is to be honest and open debate, the facts and conclusions should be clearly on the table. In the end, there will be a political decision. The British public know that, even if the politicians pretend that it is otherwise. It will also remain an extremely difficult decision, and I suspect that in the network world it will become more and more difficult to assess the final policy move on the euro.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para21"></a> The dual affinities are there; we are either doomed or blessed to live with them. I believe that we are blessed to be the land in between the great lumbering blocks. Giant blocks, like dinosaurs, have a limited lifespan, but that is the way it will be. It has been useful to discuss a part of the issue this evening.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have enjoyed the past hour, listening to three speakers quote so fully from the well written, but badly argued, papers by Global Britain. I have enjoyed seeing the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, added to the small but doughty band of Eurosceptics. They had better be careful if they want to hold on to her because she may be too rational and too respectful of facts to stay with them. Their numbers are declining. It would be sad if they died out because they give so much innocent amusement to the House.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para22"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, accused the Government of sometimes answering with derision the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I am tempted towards derision, but I shall try to avoid it. There were so many plain, vulgar errors in his analysis and his speech that I must point them out, but I shall have to try to maintain a straight face while doing so.
<P>

<a name="30129-12_para23"></a>First, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is right: we are a trading nation. Our exports of goods and services in 2001, the year for which we have the most recent figures, were 27 per cent of GDP and our imports of goods and services were 29.3 per cent of our GDP. Clearly, trade is important to us, but that does not reflect the measure of importance to us of the euro-zone or the United States, or NAFTA, which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, wants us to join. A figure of 10 per cent of exports in goods to the euro 12 does not mean that they are not important and that 90 per cent of our trade goes somewhere else. That is plainly wrong.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not have time for interruptions. We can correspond, as we do so happily.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para0"></a>Taking our exports in goods and services, our trade with the euro-zone is 13.4 per cent of GDP; our trade with the United States is 4.7 per cent of GDP. That is the balance. Even if we took NAFTA it would be only 5.3 per cent. Our imports in goods and services&#151;I am not talking about only manufacturing but also about goods and services&#151;are 14.2 per cent with the euro-zone and 15 per cent with the whole of the EU, but only 4.2 per cent with the United States and 4.8 per cent with NAFTA. Whichever way you judge the matter, it is clear that our trade with the euro-zone, as a percentage of GDP, and certainly as a percentage of total trade, is enormously more important with the euro-zone than with the United States.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para1"></a>Let me go on to the figures, as a percentage of trade, because that is the most realistic measure. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, gave some of the figures. Our trade with the EU as a whole&#151;exports of goods and services&#151;constitutes 53 per cent; for the euro-zone it is 50 per cent; for the United States it is 17 per cent; for NAFTA it is 20 per cent. Of imports of goods and services, the EU accounts for 52 per cent; the euro-zone for 49 per cent; the US 14 per cent; and NAFTA 17 per cent. By no stretch of the imagination can it be thought that the United States is more important to us.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, then tried to pull the wool over our eyes by talking about the currency in which we invoice. It is where we do the trade, not the currency in which we invoice, that matters. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, made clear that a large proportion&#151;I do not have his figure to hand&#151;of UK trade is in sterling. That does not mean that we are trading with ourselves; that is international trade. It is just convenient to invoice in sterling. If we entered the euro, all that trade would instantly be invoiced and denominated in the euro.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para3"></a>Imports and exports of oil throughout the world have always been in dollars. Our trade in oil with the Middle East is denominated in dollars. That does not have anything to do with the importance of our trade relations with the United States or the volume and value of our trade with the euro. That is such a vulgar and simple error that it is difficult to believe that it has survived debate in this House until now.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, raised another confusion: the issue of the index of exchange rates. He is right about that: the Bank of England's exchange rate index is far from perfect. As he said, it is based on an assessment made many years ago; and it is based on manufacturing rather than manufacturing and services. However, it is the only index we have, and follows the methodology used by the International Monetary Fund, so we must use it. But it is not relevant to our argument, because no policy decisions are taken on that basis. Policy decisions on monetary policy are largely taken on bilateral exchange rates rather than on any such basket.
<P>


<a name="column_1244"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para5"></a>So on all the aspects on which the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, bases his argument, he is just plain wrong. He is wrong about the balance of trade between the United States and the euro-zone. He is wrong about interest rates. He is wrong about invoicing&#151;as if invoicing were important. I do not want to hear that argument again; I have had enough of it.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para6"></a>Some other interesting things were said to which I should like to refer. I have not much to say to the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, because I agreed with so much of what he said; I can say only, "Hear, hear". The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, gave us an interesting historical analogy with the gold standard. I recommend that she reads the 2002 Cairncross lecture by Ed Balls, the economic adviser to the Treasury, in which he goes into great detail about that point, pointing out that to a large extent what went wrong then was that a political timetable was set, rather than doing what we do now, which is to decide what is in the national economic interest.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para7"></a>I also enjoyed the history lesson given by the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon. The points that he and the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, made were relevant. Yes, of course it was true that after the war the dollar was so dominant that it became and stayed a powerful denominator for international trade.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para8"></a>I was interested in what the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said about demographic change over the past three centuries. I should like to think about the figures she produced. She challenged me to say whether I disagreed with the figures or the interpretation. As they are new to me, I shall have to read them and respond to her in more detail.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is right about the decline of the manufacturing industry in this country. But, as I pointed out in response to a question from him, that decline in the manufacturing trade is common throughout the more developed world and not peculiar to this country.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para10"></a>A number of noble Lords rightly referred to the importance of inward direct investment, although they drew different conclusions. There was a minor point about the Netherlands effect and I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, about that&#151;not because I cannot give the answer but because it is so long, detailed and incomprehensible that it would bore your Lordships silly. I believe the noble Lord's argument concerned the issue of intermediate holding companies and I should like to answer him in detail about that.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para11"></a>Certainly, it is true that direct investment in this country, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, said, does not come particularly from the euro-zone&#151;although it does partly. However, when it comes from countries such as Japan, it does not come because of our trade links with the United States&#151;it goes directly there&#151;but because of our trade links with Europe. It would be enormously serious if we were to put that at risk&#151;and we would be putting it at risk if we were to turn our <P>


<a name="column_1245"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>backs on Europe in any way, whether in the form of the euro or in any other way. Clearly, direct investment is an important part of the argument. That is why it is one of the five tests.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para12"></a>As to the related issue, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, quoted Christopher Taylor of the NIESR. However, despite some of the things quoted by the noble Lord, the conclusion of Taylor in his paper was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the findings in this paper support the view that UK high-frequency exchange rate volatility would be reduced by joining EMU".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="column_1246"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column 1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
 That is another important argument and conclusion from a thoughtful and interesting paper.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para14"></a>I am not going to go through&#151;I would not be allowed to&#151;the arguments about the five tests, the preparatory work, the timing and so on. I do not need to. Everyone knows that I cannot say anything new&#151;there is nothing new to be said. If there was anything new to be said, it would not be said by me.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para15"></a>I have enjoyed the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, as always, has been a wonderful opponent and I have enjoyed the opportunity to set the record straight.

<P>

<a name="30129-13_para16"></a>Clause 53 [Jurisdiction for terrorist offences]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick </B>   moved Amendment No. 134A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 13, leave out "rape,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-13_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30129-13_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The purpose of this clause is to give our courts extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of certain offences, which are set out in Article 1 of what is known as the framework decision, which was promulgated last summer, on 13th June 2002. That is in order to comply with our obligations under Article 9 of that decision. So far, so good.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para19"></a>The purpose of my amendment is simply to draw attention to what seems to me to be the extraordinary way in which the Government seek to achieve that in the Bill. I start with the simple point in the amendment because I cannot see rape mentioned in Article 1 of the framework decision. I may have missed it, but I do not think that I have, unless it could possibly be said to be included under Article 1.1(b). Article 1.1(a) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Attacks upon a person's life which may cause death".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-13_para20"></a>
Article 1.1(b) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Attacks upon the physical integrity of a person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-13_para21"></a><P>

<a name="30129-13_para22"></a>It is hard to believe that the Council had rape in mind when it used those words. I find the notion of a terrorist rape hard to envisage. It might intimidate the individual who is being raped, but how do you intimidate the public, or even a section of the public, by committing a rape? How do you seek to influence a government by committing a rape? It seems that the draftsman has added rape at this point with no real thought about what was intended, unless&#151;if I may say so rather frivolously&#151;he had a picture in his mind of those scenes often depicted by 17th century painters of the rape of the Sabine women, or something of that kind. Surely that is not what the Council expected when it required us, by Article 9, to provide for extra-territorial jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para23"></a>There is a wider point that goes beyond the mere omission of rape. Clause 53 confers jurisdiction on our courts where they would not otherwise have it. As I understand it, we already have jurisdiction in respect of numerous countries that are designated under the <P>


<a name="column_GC168"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Suppression of Terrorism Act 1978. That long list of countries is set out on page 77 of my report. It includes all the member states of the Union and many others besides. No doubt the list has been added to since my report. I cannot see any proposal to repeal the 1978 Act&#151;if indeed it could be repealed conveniently, which I doubt. As far as I know it is still on the statute book. So why do we have to go through the whole process a second time? Is not the Suppression of Terrorism Act 1978 a sufficient compliance with our obligation under Article 9 of the framework decision? Do we really need a belt as well as braces in conferring jurisdiction on our courts? My experience is that when you have both belt and braces, they both tend to fail just when you most want them.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para24"></a>Thirdly, even supposing that we have to do something to bring some other country within the 1978 Act&#151;I am not sure which country that might be&#151;surely we are setting about it in as clumsy a way as can be. Why do we have to say that a person who has committed a rape in France, or wherever, is deemed to have committed it in England? Why not say in simple, straightforward words, which is all that Article 9 requires, that our courts shall have jurisdiction in such a case? Sir Winston Churchill said that there was too much damned deeming in our legislation. This is a perfect example of unnecessary deeming when all we need to do is say that in those cases our courts shall have jurisdiction. That is the language of the framework decision.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para25"></a>The Minister is already aware of my fourth point, because I wrote to him about it after Second Reading. He was kind enough to see me about it. We need a comprehensive list of terrorist offences, set out in a new Schedule 1 to the Terrorism Act 2000. That is where all the offences ought to be brought together. That list of offences could be added to from time to time as new conventions are agreed and new international terrorist offences are created. I recommended that in my report, but for some reason&#151;I have never been sure why&#151;that recommendation was not accepted. As a result, nowhere in our legislation is there a definition of what is a terrorist offence. One has to go far and wide to find out what they are.
<P>

<a name="30129-13_para26"></a>The most obvious terrorist offence&#151;a terrorist murder&#151;is still nowhere included as a terrorist offence. There are all sorts of little offences, such as wearing uniform or drilling the public, but nowhere is a terrorist murder described as a terrorist offence. Even if we pass the Bill as it stands, a terrorist offence of murder will still exist only by implication where it has been committed by or against a United Kingdom national abroad. There will still be nothing about a terrorist murder committed in England. That is not the way to legislate. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30129-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has raised an important issue. He is an expert because of the very valuable and thoroughly researched report that he produced. I remember attending a seminar at which a number of us discussed many of the issues that he raised. I therefore regret that <P>


<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I do not feel able to support his amendment, mainly because I feel that rape can be a terrorist offence. In some countries, particularly Islamic countries, it can be used effectively as a weapon of terror. About 10 years ago I was involved in an investigation into human rights in Kashmir. There were allegations that some of the Indian government's troops were using gang rape as a method of punishment. That was not terrorism, because a state force was allegedly involved. I am not saying that the allegations were true. They were hotly contested. However, in countries where rape is a source of disgrace to the victim, it is possible for terrorist organisations to use rape or the threat of rape as a method of terrorising and intimidating the population. Although it would be unusual for rape to be a terrorist offence, it is by no means impossible. I would be happy for the word to be left in the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   As I understand it, a terrorist offence is an act designed to influence a government or intimidate the public and made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. What the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said was compelling. Serious, horrible and dreadful though rape is, it is difficult to see how it can be said to be perpetrated for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. I hope the Minister will carefully consider the suggestion that rape does not fit in with the other offences mentioned in the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for raising these issues. By homing in on a specific issue, he has enabled the Committee to look at the broader picture. Paragraph 117 of the Explanatory Notes, refers to the specific offences listed in new Section 63B(2) and goes on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These reflect those found in Article 1 of the FD"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-14_para0"></a>
that is the framework directive. The noble and learned Lord has asked how accurate that reflection is. I wanted to ask the Minister the same question, so that he could put on the record the Government's interpretation of the reflection of Article 1 of the framework directive.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord posed a second vital question. Are we adopting belt and braces unnecessarily? Are we already compliant? In the language that the Government have used on the Floor of the House on the Courts Bill, what is the added value of having this extra compliance? The Government need to persuade us that we are not already compliant before we add this.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord returned to the intriguing point that he made on Second Reading, which found much favour on the Floor of the House. He said that there should be a clear and plain schedule of terrorist offences to which everyone can find ready reference. I should be interested if the Minister could put on the record any further reflections that the Government have had since Second Reading.
<P>


<a name="column_GC170"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para3"></a>I am aware that the habit of the Minister will be to write to the noble and learned Lord. Other noble Lords will not have seen that letter. If it exists, perhaps there have been discussions. It would be helpful to the Committee if information about that could be given so that others, such as me, could consider what approach we might take to these matters on Report.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para4"></a>Finally, I come to the kernel of the issue. The noble and learned Lord has hung the amendment on rape&#151;I am mixing my metaphors. I find this a difficult issue to tackle. A couple of years ago, in a debate on the Floor of the House about asylum and some of the methods used in countries around Bosnia and Serbia, questions were raised about how rape was used as a weapon against specific communities. I was helpfully briefed by the Black Women's Rape Action Project. That certainly focused my mind carefully on whether rape could be a terrorist offence. My noble friend Lord Carlisle said that he can envisage the first ground of it being satisfied, but how can it then be linked to whether it is being used for the promotion of a religious ideology?
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para5"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, there may be some circumstances in which people of a particular religious persuasion perceive rape as a way of terrorising some members of a community in order to force them to change their religion, or at least to stop practising their current religion. I believe that may be the case in some communities in the Indian sub-continent.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para6"></a>Although I had some briefing on the issue two years ago, I have been unable to obtain any current briefing for the Bill. That is a problem because there are organisations outwith the House which I believe should have interested themselves in this matter. I suspect that they will do so now because of the service that the noble and learned Lord has done the Committee, by raising the issue. It is important that we have a full response from the Minister, so that we can obtain opinions from those who are active in these matters outside the House. I hope that we shall be able to consider the issue further on Report.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, signalled, he spoke eloquently on those points at Second Reading. After Second Reading, it was very useful to the Government to have lengthy discussions with him to explore the issues, to ensure that we understood fully his argumentation and to reflect on it. However, I believe that the noble and learned Lord will know from the tenor of that discussion and our subsequent reflections that the Government are still of the view, as we set out on Second Reading, that we have positioned this correctly. I shall explain why.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para7"></a>Initially, I address the question of whether it is right to include rape under specific offences. It is our judgment that we would be unable to fulfil the requirement of Article 1 of the framework decision, which states that we must include offences that are <P>


<a name="column_GC171"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>classified as attacks upon the physical integrity of a person. In our view, it is clear that the offence of rape falls within this category.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para8"></a>I hoped that I should not be pressed to go further, given how particularly unpleasant this matter is as a topic. But, in a sense, the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, challenged me to articulate circumstances in which it would be a terrorist offence. Members of the Committee will recollect the Iranian Embassy siege involving the SAS. At one point, the terrorists demonstrated their determination to achieve their aims by killing someone and throwing them out of the door. If the police constable concerned in that situation had been female, I believe that it would have been conceivable that the threat or the actuality of rape could have been used to demonstrate the seriousness of the terrorists' demands. Some might say, horrific though rape is, that it would be less bad than murdering a policewoman. In that circumstance, rape would have been terrorist rape and would have been carried out for a terrorist purpose. Therefore, although it is a horrific thought, I do not believe that it is inconceivable that rape could be a terrorist offence. I hope that illustration makes the point.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para9"></a>I also believe that example illustrates a further reason why the current situation is correct. As I said on Second Reading, the essence of our interpretation of terrorist offences is that they are acts or threats that are defined as terrorist by the context and the motive. The example of the Iranian siege illustrates that neatly. While one would not normally consider rape a terrorist offence, in that particular example it clearly would have been had it taken place.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para10"></a>Therefore, how are terrorist offences defined in that situation in order to encapsulate all the circumstances when the context and the motive&#151;peculiar though they might be&#151;together with the act or the threat, combine to make a terrorist act rather than a simple criminal offence? That is one&#151;if not the only&#151;reason why we believe that the current thrust of legislation is right.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para11"></a>I shall go into a little more detail. The purpose for which acts are carried out determines whether they are terrorist acts. The pragmatic point, which is not irrelevant, is that current legislation works well. The scope of the powers is well understood by the police and the security and intelligence agencies. To dismantle such legislation would be impractical, costly and time-consuming. Therefore, we do not see the benefit of doing so. We are not aware of the mischief to which this amendment would be a remedy. I do not think that when the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, carried out his important and valuable review of terrorist legislation, he highlighted that this was a problem. Maybe I am wrong on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-14_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Wrong Carlisle!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I was referring to what I thought was the recent review by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para12"></a>The clauses currently make it clear exactly which offences we seek to take extra-territorial jurisdiction for. United Kingdom legislation is the most practical <P>


<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and appropriate means of ensuring that we can prosecute those involved in terrorist activity. To list or attempt to list all crimes that could be committed by terrorists in counter-terrorism legislation is not necessary or desirable.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para13"></a>I turn now to specifics. When we were reflecting on the offences found in Article 1, we listed all those offences in normal criminal law which could be covered by the framework decision. In general, there are no exclusively terrorist offences under United Kingdom law. Therefore, we had to interpret the offences listed in the framework decision. The Suppression of Terrorism Act concerns extra-territorial jurisdiction over offences carried out in states who are signatories to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Those clauses cover acts outside European states by and against UK nationals or residents.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para14"></a>The language used is standard to that used to take extra-territorial jurisdiction. Similar language is used in the Terrorism Act 2000 and other legislation. It gives jurisdiction to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland if the act committed would have been an offence there.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para15"></a>Finally, is there a real difference between UK tourists being attacked and physically assaulted in order to deter their presence in a foreign state or to make a point to the local government and the same terrorists conducting a campaign against UK tourists to achieve the same end? We believe that situation is unlikely, but possible.
<P>

<a name="30129-14_para16"></a>For these reasons, we do not believe that there is a significant problem. Therefore, there is no need to change. For the reasons given, we believe that rape can be a terrorist offence. Therefore, with regret, we resist the argumentation put forward by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd.

<A NAME="30129-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   When the Minister was describing the Iranian siege terrorist attack&#151;which I found very useful because I recently saw it repeated on television and could picture it&#151;he said that rape or the threat of rape could have been an offence. Is the threat of rape included here or was that a slip of the tongue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Yes, it is, under Article 1.1(a), threatening to commit any of the acts listed in (a) to (h).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   I am very grateful in particular to the Minister for answering so fully. I may have misheard him on one point when he said that there are no specific terrorist offences in the Act. Among other places, they are all set out in Part 6 of the 2000 Act. That is my fourth and final point. All the offences should be listed together in one place, not scattered, as now, through three different Acts, which I find very confusing. I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para0"></a>He did not deal with the point on the Suppression of Terrorism Act, but as I had not given notice on that issue, perhaps that is easily understood. However, I hope that he will think again about the broader points that I have tried to mention&#151;not necessarily the <P>


<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specific point on rape. I fully understand those arguments. In particular, I hope that he will think about the extraordinarily clumsy way of drafting the jurisdiction provision. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Before we close, it is always a mistake for Ministers to attempt to do things themselves. While I am absolutely clear that threatening to commit any of the acts under Article 1 is covered in the treaty, I am advised that the threat of rape is not an offence under domestic law. Therefore, we do not take extra-territorial jurisdiction for it. Attempts, conspiracy, and so forth are in domestic law, so we take extra-territorial jurisdiction over them. I am surprised that the threat of rape is not an offence, but I am so advised.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 135:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 27, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-15_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(i) aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of, or attempting or conspiring to commit, any of the offences in paragraphs (a) to (h)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30129-15_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Having heard that exchange, I am now more confused about my own amendment than I was before. In a sense, I am returning to the underlying theme of the noble and learned Lord's argument&#151;whether we have a belt and braces position here. Are we doing more than is compliant? In addition, are we doing enough? The issue of the threat of committing an offence is relevant.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para4"></a>As the noble and learned Lord said, Clause 53 inserts a number of new sections into the Terrorism Act 2000 to provide for extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of offences linked to terrorism that are committed abroad by UK nationals and residents. To cut to the chase on this, when I first looked at the list of offences in the Bill, I noticed that&#151;unlike when, as a magistrate, one just sees them listed&#151;there was no reference to the related offences, such as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of, or attempting or conspiring to commit",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-15_para5"></a>
any of those offences. I was not thinking only of threatening. Threatening can be one of those, but it is possible to aid and abet without personally threatening&#151;a person may not be present when an offence takes place or is attempted. Therefore, as I read the Bill, there will be no assumption of extra-territorial jurisdiction in cases of terrorist conspiracies or attempts to commit the terrorist offences listed in these sections.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para6"></a>I tabled Amendment No. 135 to find out if that is what the Government intend. It would mean that terrorists could not be prosecuted under the new extra-territorial jurisdiction provisions for conspiracies or attempts, but only for the commission of the actual terrorist atrocities. Perhaps I have missed the provision in the Bill or there is something in the convention that gives this interpretation to it. <P>


<a name="column_GC174"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Certainly, I am not clear and I should be extremely grateful if the Minister would explain whether aiding and abetting are covered and, if so, how.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para7"></a>I also wondered why other terrorist offences, such as causing an explosion likely to endanger life or property and attempting or conspiring to cause an explosion, are not listed. I believe that I am asking a supplementary to the question asked by the noble and learned Lord about terrorist murder. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   We interpreted this as a probing amendment to determine whether we had taken extra-territorial jurisdiction in the secondary offences highlighted in the amendments to fulfil the requirements of Article 4. In that respect, they are right and proper probing amendments. I assure the Committee that we have and I shall explain the detail of how this has been done.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para8"></a>Article 4 of the framework decision requires member states to ensure that inciting, aiding, abetting or attempting to commit an offence is made punishable. Under UK law jurisdiction for secondary and inchoate offences, such as aiding, abetting, attempting, inciting, conspiring, counselling and procuring, is dependent on whether we have taken jurisdiction for the substantive offence in the UK. As we are taking extra-territorial jurisdiction over the substantive offences listed in Article 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of the framework decision in certain circumstances, we do not need to legislate specifically in order to take extra-territorial jurisdiction over aiding, abetting, attempting, inciting, conspiring, counselling or procuring to commit the offences listed in Sections 63B and 63C in the particular circumstances described in those sections.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para9"></a>Rather, where an extra-territorial offence is created, extra-territorial jurisdiction is also automatically taken over secondary and inchoate offences. No further legislation is necessary in order to achieve that. I hope that answers the very necessary probing amendment raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification that secondary and inchoate offences are covered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I regret the fact that I am moving up and down like a Jack-in-the-box, but a further question was raised which it would be better to answer now rather than troubling the noble Baroness with a letter. We already take extra-territorial jurisdiction over explosives offences under Section 62 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This also covers chemical and biological offences; nuclear offences are covered by the Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983.

My amendments would simply change that definition by inserting the words "or employed by".
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para19"></a>I confess that there may be other protections that I have not looked into&#151;for example, under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Therefore, are there any other ways in which such persons would be given protection as opposed to what appears to be a gap in the Bill? I beg to move.

<A NAME="30129-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   New Section 63C(1) of the Terrorism Act gives the UK extra-territorial jurisdiction over certain domestic offences where they are committed against UK nationals or residents and "protected persons" outside the UK as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para20"></a>Subsection (3) of this section specifies those persons who are "protected persons". This includes, inter alia, a member of a UK diplomatic mission within the meaning of Article 1(b) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961.
<P>

<a name="30129-15_para21"></a>Therefore, the definition of a member of a diplomatic mission and consular post as contained in these provisions includes the employees of the mission and consular post, as the definition includes diplomatic, technical, administrative and service staff. So employees are already covered.

Therefore, for those reasons I am happy to be able to reassure the noble Baroness that they are so protected.

<P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 35, line 24, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30129-16_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now turn to a very long part of the Bill, but one which is almost entirely uncontroversial&#151;certainly to Members on these Benches. I refer to the issue of driving disqualifications and reciprocal recognition of those disqualifications. In moving this amendment, with the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 139.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para7"></a>The Bill states that the duty to inform foreign authorities of the disqualification of a non-UK resident does not apply in prescribed circumstances. I am attempting to ascertain what those circumstances are. Will the Minister explain how and when the regulations will be made? Will they be published; and, if so, under what conditions?
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para8"></a>Paragraph 123 of the Explanatory Notes states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Notification would not be required, for example, where another Member State has declared that it will apply certain discretionary conditions to the recognition of the disqualifications, as described in Article 6(2) of the Convention".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para9"></a>
I merely included that wording in the substance of my amendment, in order to ask the Minister just what is meant by that example. What other examples are there? If this is merely "an" example of what can happen, on what other basis can certain discretionary conditions be applied? We are told that the circumstances will be prescribed in regulations. So far as I am aware, Members of the Committee have not yet received any information about the regulations. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Under Article 6(2) of the EU convention, the state of residence may declare that it will always refuse to recognise a disqualification where the conduct involved does not constitute an offence in its legislation or where a disqualification would not be an applicable penalty for the offence. It may also refuse to act where the remaining period of disqualification to be enforced is less than one month.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para10"></a>The UK is not required under the EU convention to notify a disqualification to a member state which has declared that it will always apply conditions that would preclude the recognition of the disqualification. <P>


<a name="column_GC177"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Bill therefore provides for regulations to state when the duty to notify a disqualification will not arise.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para11"></a>The second amendment&#151;which would disapply the duty to notify a member state where it has made a declaration in respect of Article 6.2&#151;addresses the issue but does not provide the full remedy.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para12"></a>The EU convention allows a member state to declare that it will always apply the conditions in Article 6.2,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in whole or in part".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para13"></a>
Regulations allow us to reflect the exact terms of the declaration made by each member state.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para14"></a>We do not know at this stage how many member states will make a declaration in respect of Article 6.2. That will only become clear as and when other member states ratify the convention and we are able to conclude agreements with them to implement the convention on a bilateral basis. It is at that point that regulations will be made to detail clearly the circumstances in which the duty to notify a disqualification will not apply in respect of that state.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para15"></a>Regulations will be made on a bilateral basis with other member states to ratify the convention. It is probably widely known that, at present, only Spain has ratified the convention. We shall seek to begin negotiations with the Spanish to decide the terms of the regulations shortly after the Bill comes into force.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para16"></a>The noble Baroness asked what regulations would be made as regards other prescribed circumstances. They might cover such matters as the conduct for which the driving disqualification had been imposed; the remaining period of disqualification that might have to be enforced; and where disqualification was not a measure available under the legislation of the state of residence. I have probably not satisfied the noble Baroness on every point raised, but I hope that I have covered most.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He has gone a long way towards satisfying me on these matters. I was certainly grateful to him for his comment on the bilateral basis on which implementation will take place. That is important and his response was very helpful. As the Minister will know, the Automobile Association, among others, has been very concerned about whether there will be reciprocal agreements and whether we shall jump the gun and put the provisions of this Bill into effect before there is a bilateral agreement.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para17"></a>I need to examine the Minister's remarks carefully. There remain other possible situations in which discretion might be applied. I do not think that I shall need to return to any major point, but further clarification may be required. I shall need to ensure that the Automobile Association is fully satisfied. Naturally, as we are in Grand Committee, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30129-16_para20"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 55 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I shall refer specifically to Clause 55(5), but, first, I want to raise a general issue which I hope will warm the heart of my noble friend Lord Renton and strike a chord with other Members of the Committee. Ever since the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and myself entered Parliament, at about the same time, in 1964&#151;in fact, the noble Lord won his seat shortly after that&#151;we have heard every incoming government state, before taking office, that it is their intention to pass less legislation and to do it in a clearer and simpler form.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para21"></a>One has only to stand in the Library of either House and look at the expansion in the volumes of legislation that has occurred year by year, to see not only that governments have failed to pass less legislation, but that they have certainly not done it in shorter and simpler form. I am concerned about the complexity in the drafting of every Bill&#151;so much so that it is almost impossible to follow what is being said.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para22"></a>In this Bill, we have an example, not of complexity leading to a failure to understand what is being said, but of unnecessary verbosity and repetition. Clauses 55 and 56 require that the appropriate Minister&#151;in this case the Secretary of State&#151;shall give notice where an individual from another country has been convicted of a motoring offence in this country and has been disqualified.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para23"></a>Clause 55 starts by stating that Section 56, which gives the Home Secretary a duty to notify the appropriate authority abroad, will apply where,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an individual . . . who is normally resident in a member State other than the United Kingdom is convicted of an offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para24"></a>
That is simple. Secondly, it states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no appeal is outstanding in relation to the offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para25"></a>
That is simple. And, thirdly, it provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the driving disqualification condition is met in relation to the offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para26"></a>
That is also simple. Why do we need subsection (5), which is a further seven lines, to define what is meant by the words "no appeal is outstanding"? Subsection (5) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no appeal is outstanding in relation to an offence if&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para27"></a> (a) no appeal is brought against an offender's conviction of the offence, or any order made on his conviction, within the time allowed for making such appeals, or"&#151;
alternatively, if he has brought an appeal&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) such an appeal is brought and the proceedings on appeal are finally concluded".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-16_para28"></a>
Surely, any appeal is outstanding until the time limit has passed during which he can make an appeal, or he has already made an appeal. Equally, an appeal is outstanding from the time that notice has been given of an intention to appeal until those appeal proceedings have been finally concluded. How can "no appeal is outstanding" mean anything other than what is said in subsection (5)?
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para29"></a>Subsection (5) is a good example of a totally otiose and unnecessary subsection, which defines a matter that does not need defining and which is well known to <P>


<a name="column_GC179"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all the courts in this country. I know that I shall be shot down in flames and told that it means many other things, but I cannot think&#151;and I challenge any other member of the Bar immediately to think&#151;what "no appeal is outstanding" can possibly mean, other than that no appeal has been made, that the time for making any appeal has been completed, or, if one has been made, that it has been concluded.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para30"></a>If we start with the simple exercise of taking out subsection (5) and then apply the same consideration consistently to other clauses in the Bill and other Bills, perhaps we shall achieve shorter, simpler and easier to follow legislation.

<A NAME="30129-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Carlisle. I confess that more than a quarter of a century ago I was made the chairman of the only official parliamentary committee since 1870 to advise on how Acts of Parliament should be drafted. In our report we tried to prevent over-zealousness in drafting, such as inserting unnecessary matters or entering into unnecessary detail. For the reasons that my noble friend Lord Carlisle has given, subsection (5) is not only unnecessary, but confusing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Far be it for me to contradict both noble Lords who have spoken of their length of time in their Lordships' House and in another place, and who have knowledge and experience. In particular, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, obviously occupied a special place when he reviewed how legislation should be written. My guess is that there are drafting conventions and that they change from time to time.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para31"></a>I am advised that subsection (5) is required because it makes clear&#151;perhaps not to the satisfaction of the noble Lords who have spoken&#151;that strict time limits apply and that the Minister need not wait to see whether special leave is granted in special circumstances. That is its purpose.
<P>

<a name="30129-16_para32"></a>The subsection may appear unnecessary and otiose to the noble Lords who spoke, but it is there for a specific purpose. Certainly, I shall reread it in relation to the rest of the clause, but that is the explanation. Perhaps when the noble Lords have reflected on what I have said and have reread the provision, they may also see the point being made.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I find my noble friend's explanation rather unconvincing. I think that the least he can do is to say that he will take what has been said back and reconsider the situation. There is no point in including unnecessary provisions in legislation. Not only is it confusing for the advocates, but, more importantly, it is confusing to those who are charged with offences. I do not want to reach a hard and fast conclusion now because I believe that it is possible that on reflection my noble friend will be advised in another way, but I think that we should return to the situation on further consideration of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   It seems extraordinary that it is necessary to say that no appeal is brought if <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it has not been brought within the time allowed. However, if it is the convention to say that, I suggest it might be changed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I reluctantly get involved in this argument. I feel that the problem may be slightly the other way round. For example, if a month has been given during which time a convicted person can decide whether to make an appeal and he does not decide to appeal for three weeks, how within that three weeks can one say that an appeal is outstanding in the ordinary sense of the word because no appeal has been brought? So, it may be that this wording intends to make sure that a disqualification order cannot come into effect in the UK during a period while an appeal can still be brought within the time limits, but no appeal has in fact been brought.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I add my six pennyworth. I had problems with this subsection, but with paragraph (b). I could understand why paragraph (a) inserted time limits, but (b) refers to when,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings on appeal are finally concluded",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-17_para0"></a>
which seems not to refer to time limits as such. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister could reflect on the matter between now and Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, I am not totally convinced by the Minister's explanation of why the words are necessary. I hope that he will look at the matter again because I believe that the principle that we should not put in unnecessary clauses and subsections is a valid one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I do not disagree with that argument. That would not be sensible. We all want matters to be brief, clear, plain and simple. The answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is that his understanding fits into the category of "as well". So, it adds something. We are always willing to look at whether wording can be improved, but I say that without giving a commitment. We should all try to keep legislation as brief and to the point as we possibly can.

<a name="column_GC181"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an individual has access to the proper legal advice and that he receives proper written notice of notification of proceedings against him.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para6"></a>We seek to probe the drafting of some of the subsections relating to driving, which appear so vague that at some stages I was unsure of their purpose. I refer back to what my noble friend Lord Carlisle said in his clause stand part argument.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para7"></a>I hope the Government accept that an accused person should have proper legal advice in whatever country the proceedings commence. Would that not be especially important in a country where English is not the first language and a motorist has problems understanding what is happening? Will the Minister make provision in the Bill for fairness in legal proceedings and provide the legal help that should be available? Of course there will be many questions about how it can be taken up and the costs that might be involved and who should bear them.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para8"></a>Beyond the initial encounter with the police and after the hearing, the Bill states that, where the offender did not take part in the proceedings, a notice informing the foreign authorities of a driving disqualification of a non-UK resident would be accompanied by evidence that the offender was duly notified.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para9"></a>I am curious as to how that evidence would be presented. Would it merely be a copy of any correspondence that had been sent to the individual? If so, how do we know that the individual had actually received it; that there was good service?
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para10"></a>Finally, I must admit that I was puzzled by some of the subsections in the clause. For example, subsection (3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A notice under this section may contain such other information as the appropriate Minister considers appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-17_para11"></a>
That is not the most felicitous drafting. The term seems rather vague. I should be grateful if the Minister could give us a fuller flavour of its meaning. What other information does the Minister envisage would come under that subsection? When will the other information be necessary, and which Minister would intervene in such proceedings? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Amendment No. 139ZB would leave out subsection (3). I think that it should be left out. It gives rise to uncertainty as to whether the information referred to is to be considered as appropriate by the appropriate Minister without his giving any reasons for it. In any event, it is an excess of zeal to invite the opinion of the appropriate Minister.

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imposed. But how could one confirm that an offender who was moving around the country had been duly notified? Out of genuine ignorance I seek clarification. Normally, service of the notice would be effected by registered post and would be deemed to have occurred on its acceptance. Could one state with certainty that an offender travelling about the country on holiday had been duly notified of the proceedings?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Uncharacteristically, the noble Lord has misinformed himself. As I understand it, the authorities must only give notice by registered post where it is prescribed. Notice can be effected by other means. If the authorities cannot find someone who is travelling about the country&#151;by caravan, for example&#151;the service of notice is effected by registered post or whatever means the statute confers. It is not important that the individual should always be found.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Committee Members have asked several questions. In setting out the thinking behind Clause 56, I hope that I can answer them.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para13"></a>In general, the amendments would place additional evidential requirements on the notification and recognition of driving disqualifications between the United Kingdom and member states. They would also restrict the information that the UK could provide to a foreign authority or a disqualified driver resident in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para14"></a>As is plain, our starting point for this part of the Bill is the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications and what it says should be required to recognise a foreign disqualification. The convention requires us to notify a driver's state of residence of a disqualification covered by the convention. The notification and driver's licence must be accompanied by information to locate the driver; the original or certified copy of the order of disqualification; a brief statement of the circumstances of the offence and the legal provisions that gave rise to the disqualification; details of the disqualification; and a statement that no appeal is outstanding.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para15"></a>If the offender did not take part in the proceedings that resulted in disqualification, the convention requires that the notification should also include evidence that the offender was duly notified of the proceedings. That is the information that the convention has determined will normally be sufficient to allow the driver's state of residence to satisfy itself that the offender had an adequate opportunity to defend himself, and to allow it to give effect to the disqualification. If it is not satisfied that the offender had an adequate opportunity to defend himself, it may ask for additional information, and, ultimately, it could refuse to recognise the disqualification. Those are comprehensive and very equitable arrangements to allow the recognition of a driving disqualification in another member state.
<P>


<a name="column_GC183"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para16"></a>Amendment No. 139ZA would require a notice of disqualification given to another member state to include a statement to the effect that there is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"written evidence that the offender has had adequate opportunity to defend himself and to gain access to legal advice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-17_para17"></a>
At first glance, the amendment is perfectly sensible and reasonable. But it would take the requirements for what is to be included in the notification sent to a driver's state of residence beyond the factual information required by the convention. It would also introduce a test concerning access to legal advice, which is not covered by the convention.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para18"></a>The convention rightly leaves it to the driver's state of residence to form a view on whether someone has had an adequate opportunity to defend himself, based on the factual information provided by the state of the offence. The Bill provides for the information to include either confirmation that the offender took part in the proceedings resulting in disqualification or, if he did not participate, evidence of notification and that he had the opportunity to participate. Amendment No. 139ZA would require the UK to make a statement that written evidence exists of the adequacy of the driver's opportunity to defend himself and to gain access to legal advice. That statement would involve a subjective assessment of the fairness of the court proceedings. Without the evidence itself being transmitted, it would add nothing of value to the procedure.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para19"></a>Likewise, Amendment No. 139ZD, which deals with the recognition of foreign disqualifications in the UK, goes beyond what is required for the purposes of the convention to confirm that an offender has had an adequate opportunity to defend himself. It would make it a condition of recognition of a foreign disqualification in the UK that there is written evidence that the offender has had adequate opportunity to defend himself and to gain access to legal advice. The Bill already makes the recognition of a foreign disqualification conditional on the offender's having been duly notified of, and entitled to take part in, the proceedings. This is a less subjective test than that envisaged by the amendment. It also reflects, in line with the general application of the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions in the EU, that all member states are signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair hearing.

<a name="30129-17_para20"></a>Amendment No. 139ZB would restrict the content of a notice of a disqualification given to another member state to only those details specified in Clause 56(2) and no other information. That would impede the effective operation of the notification procedures by preventing the UK from including additional information that would assist the driver's state of residence in executing the disqualification. It might include information relating to the court proceedings, or to the period of the disqualification already served in the UK, which the driver's state of residence must take into account. Member states may also have particular information requirements in order to give effect to a disqualification. Those will become apparent only during our concluding agreements for <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the bilateral implementation of the convention. Amendment No. 139ZB would prevent us from doing that.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para21"></a>Amendment No. 139ZC, which requires that evidence should be "written", is unnecessary and potentially restrictive, particularly at a time when steps are being taken to introduce electronic transmission. Although the notification sent to the driver's state of residence is likely to rely on written evidence to show that he was duly notified of the proceedings against him, the convention requirement is only for "evidence". To go beyond that could create problems with other states.
<P>

<a name="30129-17_para22"></a>Amendment No. 139ZF concerns the notice given to a driver resident in the United Kingdom that a foreign disqualification is to be recognised here. It would restrict the content of that notice to only those details specified in Clause 59(1). It would be unduly restrictive, preventing the appropriate Minister from including additional information, as he considers appropriate, in a notice of disqualification sent to a UK resident disqualified abroad. That would not be terribly helpful in those circumstances. Information would be included in the notice only where it was relevant to the offender in respect of the disqualification imposed on him. The offender may, for example, be required to surrender his licence where it has not been seized by the state in which the offence was committed. Information on how to reapply for a licence might also be usefully included. It is helpful to ensure that that takes place.

<A NAME="30129-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   In his response to the amendments that would ensure that the offender could defend himself and get advice, the noble Lord said that all participating countries would have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, and, therefore, they would be bound to make such provision. Is he sure that that is the case? Have we been told that disqualification can result from actions that are not a criminal offence in some countries? If so, does the European Convention on Human Rights apply in those cases? I ask out of ignorance. It is important that we know.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para0"></a>Did the noble Lord reply to Amendment No. 139ZB, which would omit Clause 56(3)?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I thought that I did. I explained that the amendment would be unduly restrictive. In some circumstances it would be helpful to include additional information that the Minister considers appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para1"></a>In response to the first point, all EU states have signed the European Convention on Human Rights.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Does that mean that a disqualification cannot be imposed in any of those countries without the offender having had the possibility of speaking up for himself in court and having access to assistance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   While the Minister's advisers are considering an answer, I draw attention to a circumstance that I do not think the Minister's reply <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>covered. A person can be disqualified from driving without being convicted. The DVLA in this country considers that some people's health makes them unfit to drive. People can, therefore, be deprived of their driving licence simply on those grounds rather than as the result of an offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In response to the noble Baroness's point, the convention applies only to road traffic offences that constitute a criminal offence. Does that answer her point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I thought that I had heard in previous discussions that some non-criminal offences result in disqualification, and, therefore, they might not be covered by the European Convention on Human Rights. I may be missing the point, but I thought that that was a gap in the Minister's argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am prepared to accept that it might be. We shall take that point away and reflect on it further.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para2"></a>To answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, I must say that the circumstances to which he referred are not covered by the convention. It relates to revocation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monson:  </B>  In resisting Amendment No. 139ZB, which would leave out subsection (3), the Minister said that he could think of circumstances in which it would be useful for the Minister to have the power to furnish additional information. Can the Minister give specific examples of occasions when that might be useful?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I provided examples as I ran through the amendments. I said, I think, that it might include information relating to the court proceedings themselves or to the period of disqualification already served in the United Kingdom, which must be taken into account by the driver's state of residence. Does that help the noble Lord?

<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I have much to reflect upon, and I have one or two further questions for the Minister. The Minister gave full answers and tried to be as helpful as possible.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para3"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour raised an important issue about the status of administrative proceedings that may cause a driving disqualification. In our earlier discussion on administrative proceedings, I understood that it might include such an eventuality. As that would not count as criminal proceedings, it would not come under the ECHR and provisions relating to fairness of access to legal advice. There may be some way of defining administrative proceedings that cover driving disqualifications so that they fall within the definition of criminal proceedings. That is not beyond the realms of <P>


<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possibility. However, the Minister has not yet told us that, and it would be helpful if he reflected on it between now and Report and gave us a further explanation. When we discussed administrative proceedings before, I thought that I was happy about what they were. There may be further issues to explore.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para4"></a>I have some problems with another issue, to which we may need to return on Report. I shall give the Minister notice of a couple of questions that may lie behind amendments to be tabled at that stage. If a non-UK national has not taken part in proceedings, we must give evidence that he was duly notified, as the Minister said. Thus, we come back to the question of what is good service?
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para5"></a>Until I came to the House, I sat as a magistrate, as did my noble friend Lady Seccombe. I have not sat for five years, so I may be out of touch with changes in procedure or in the law. I accept that. However, I sat for 13 years or more on a Bench for an area in which 7 per cent of the local population were&#151;still are&#151;Italian. Those people hold Italian citizenship, not British citizenship, and they and their visitors travel between this country and Italy with great regularity. A significant number of drivers on the roads of Woking hold foreign driving licences. It was not uncommon for our court in Woking&#151;north-west Surrey&#151;to impose a disqualification on persons who had not taken part in proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para6"></a>Normally, as my noble friend Lady Seccombe reminds me, the first thing to be done if a magistrate thinks that he or she is going to impose a disqualification is to call the person to the court. Certainly, there were occasions on which we imposed disqualification on a person who did not attend, after we offered them goodness knows how many occasions to do so. There could be a lacuna. It could happen that someone who has been disqualified might not have received proper evidence of proceedings, even if we thought that such evidence had been provided. We must consider more carefully how the Bill will bite on such people. What is proper evidence that the document has been received?
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para7"></a>The questions that we will ask next time around in the context of our amendments will be the following: what steps will the Government take to ensure that the evidence has been duly notified to somebody, what processes will the Government put in place&#151;they do not exist now in the court system&#151;and what negotiations are the Government having with our EU partners about what will be acceptable evidence, both ways? The Minister has already referred to Spain, which may be the first candidate. I am aware from personal experience that, when the Guardia Civil stop motorists on the roads in Spain, they do not necessarily follow proper procedure. It can be an interesting situation over there, so, if we have reciprocal arrangements, we must ensure that they work properly both ways.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para8"></a>Having given notice of a possible amendment for the purposes of elucidation on Report, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30129-18_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 139ZDA, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 156ZB.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para16"></a>They are, perhaps, the simplest of all the amendments. They are designed to get the Government to explain why they did not, for the sake of clarity, put into the Bill the annex to the convention on driving disqualifications. We go back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on other issues. For the sake of clarity for those who will have to operate the Bill, it would be helpful if such a schedule were in the Bill. Why did not the Government decide to do it? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The reason is as simple as the amendment. It would not add to or subtract from the effect of the clause. We specified that an offence fell within the terms of the clause if it was constituted by conduct that fell within any of the paragraphs of the annex to the convention.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para17"></a>There is no good reason for reproducing the annex to the convention in the Bill. The EU convention is a public document, and anyone who wants can access it and find out what is in the annex. That is consistent with the approach that we adopted elsewhere in the Bill. It would be unwieldy to replicate the text of EU provisions in the Bill, unless there were extremely compelling reasons to do so. Comments have already been made about the length and complexity of Bills; I am not sure that, if we did what the noble Baroness suggests, we would do much to keep the Bill as simple as we would like.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-18_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I have tried to follow the argument. I think that I have now got it correct. I want to take up the point made by my noble friend Lord Renton a few moments ago.
<P>

<a name="30129-18_para18"></a>A close member of my family is epileptic. Paragraph 5 of the schedule to be inserted by Amendment No. 156ZB shows that the convention covers driving a vehicle while disqualified. Under the clauses that we are discussing, someone need not go anywhere near a court to be disqualified. I cannot find any reference to a duty on the appropriate Minister to notify a decision by the DVLA to disqualify to the General Secretariat. Surely, that is what should happen.

<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disqualification is simply imposed by the DVLA without the person coming before any court. That is relevant to the provisions that we are considering.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para0"></a>If the Government and their advisers have not contemplated such a situation, it would be right for the Minister to give an undertaking that, between now and Report, that situation will be considered. Either, it should be made subject to the same provisions as those relating to a conviction or some other arrangements should be made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I confess that I was slightly thrown by the question. I think that the answer is that the situation that both noble Lords described is outside the scope of what we are considering today. The convention applies only to road traffic offences; as I understand it, it does not apply to what both noble Lords described as administrative circumstances. I might be wrong about that, as I am prepared to accept, at all times, that I can be wrong about such things. We need to investigate the points made by the noble Lords in more detail. I think that that is why the disqualification to which they refer is not covered by the convention in the way in which they think it might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   If I run into the back of a lorry in my car, am taken to court and am disqualified because I did it in such a monstrous way, that would be one thing. However, if my doctor advises me that I have become rather old and should stop driving and I hand my licence in, that is another thing. If I hang on to my licence and use it in another country, that would be wrong. However, that is not what we are talking about. Am I right?
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para1"></a>There is a difference between being disqualified because one has an illness or because one is old or blind and committing a driving offence. Is that what the Minister is saying? That is what I was thinking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I shall try to be helpful to the Minister. As I understand from having examined driving law, one is disqualified for driving by age, if one is too young, too old or has a disability. However, the offence does not occur until, having been disqualified for driving, one actually drives. That is the difference that the Government are trying to explain between what is in the proposed schedule and the circumstances described by my noble friends.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We have got to the same point. We have agreement on that.

The provisions give power to the Minister and the Secretary of State respectively to extend the time for appeals and the production of a licence. I seek clarification of when the Minister thinks that that power would be used. Are there any criteria that would automatically allow for an extension of time? Can the defendant ask for an extension, or is it merely a matter of executive decision? I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The decision to give effect to a foreign disqualification necessitates giving the offender notice that he is disqualified. Although the offender should have been aware of the proceedings in the state of the offence, the notice given under Clause 58 will be used to inform the driver of disqualification in the UK. We consider that a period of 21 days before the disqualification takes effect is reasonable, sensible and appropriate. As I understand it, the period follows on from the time period allowed in relation to domestic disqualifications and the decision of the magistrates' court. The noble Baroness will of course have more knowledge and insight into magistrates' courts than I could possibly have.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para7"></a>The power to prescribe a period longer than 21 days is needed because it would allow us to make adjustments in line with any changes to the appeal rules and also in the light of experience in the operation of the convention procedures. If experience shows that drivers consistently experience difficulties in complying with the requirements within the 21-day period, we can of course prescribe a longer period. The regulations would not prescribe different time limits for different circumstances. The time limits would be common to all cases. Nor would the regulations prescribe a period shorter than 21 days.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I should like to raise one general point. We move now to the right of appeal. As I understand it, if someone was convicted of a motoring offence in a court abroad and disqualified and the conditions of Clause 57 have been complied with, then, under Clause 58, the Minister would give the notice to the offender which effectively told him that he is disqualified for the equivalent period in this country. Clause 60 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person who is disqualified by virtue of section 58"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-19_para16"></a>
namely, because he has been disqualified by a court abroad and notified of that disqualification in accordance with the provisions of this legislation&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may, after giving notice to the appropriate Minister of his intention to do so, appeal to the appropriate court against that disqualification".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-19_para17"></a>
The appropriate court is said to be the appropriate magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para18"></a>To what is the appeal limited? Is it limited to the technical matters in Clause 58? Subsection (3) says that if the appropriate court is satisfied that Section 58 does not apply to the applicant's case, it must allow the appeal; otherwise it must dismiss the appeal. Or is it a full and wide right of appeal on the facts of the original conviction and the original disqualification?
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para19"></a>Let us say that someone was convicted in France of the equivalent offence of dangerous driving. Does the clause say that he has the right to appeal against that conviction in this country? If he has the right to appeal on the facts, how will that appeal be heard? I suspect that the answer is that his appeal will be limited to merely technical matters, but I should be grateful if the Minister would clear that up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for the question. As he surmised, the right of appeal does not extend to the circumstances of the original offence and conviction. However, it does allow a driver to appeal on the grounds of any of the criteria for recognising a foreign disqualification which are set out in Clause 57. For example, and as we have already discussed, an appeal could be brought where the offender considered that he had not been properly notified of the proceedings. An appeal could also be brought on the grounds that an appeal is outstanding in the state of the offence&#151;the effect of which has consistently been considered in relation to the convention.

On Monday evening this week, Tasawar Hussain was tragically killed in Bradford, in West Yorkshire. He was shot in cold blood in a city street in the early evening after giving chase to two armed robbers. It was another reminder, if one were needed, of how dangerous some of our streets have become for honest citizens. I am sure that, over the past few days, we have all thought about the families and how tragic the events have been for them.

I do not know whether we will see those proposals soon, and I do not want to enter the realms of testing the Government on when they will be presented. The proposals will, however, be given proper and due consideration when they are brought forward.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para30"></a>In considering the Bill, the Committee has looked very much at international co-operation on criminal matters. I have tried to link my proposals with that. In this amendment, I have looked at focusing on the work done by the Home Office and the law enforcement agencies in preventing the importation of firearms into the United Kingdom. I pay tribute to the work already <P>


<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>being undertaken in this field by the men and women of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad, the police and other law enforcement agencies, not least Customs and Excise, which is at the front end of trying to find these items.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para31"></a>The amendment would require the Secretary of State to facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in this field by ensuring effective international co-operation between the police forces of the United Kingdom and the authorities in other countries. It would also require the Home Secretary to have regard to the desirability of ensuring such effective co-operation to prevent the importation of firearms when he is setting the priorities, plans and objectives for police forces under the legislation, which authorises him to set those priorities, plans and objectives.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para32"></a>Sadly, there is no shortage of foreign countries from which firearms can be illegally imported. In the Sunday Times of 6th January, an article entitled "Silenced by the rule of the gun" listed several sources. It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nobody knows the exact number of handguns illegally circulating in Britain: experts estimate the figure could be anything from 250,000 to 10 million".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-19_para33"></a>
It is a horrifying number. The article continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Many weapons have been smuggled into the country from places such as eastern Europe, the central Asian republics and the Balkans, sometimes traded for drugs by organised crime groups".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-19_para34"></a><P>

<a name="30129-19_para35"></a>The National Criminal Intelligence Service's annual report entitled Threat Assessment of Serious and Organised Crime, published last July, stated at paragraph 7.16:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There have been recent recoveries in the UK of illegal firearms originating from Argentina, Australia, South Africa, Israel, Croatia and Switzerland, and especially the USA. There appears also to have been an increase in firearms traced to Central and Eastern European countries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-19_para36"></a>
The report goes on to state that, as a result of the recent adoption of the United Nations Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, foreign governments may rush to sell their surplus firearms stocks before the protocol is incorporated into law in the signatory countries and they are prevented from doing so. The report also reveals that there has been a recent seizure in this country of a consignment of firearms manufactured in the 1950s, unused and in their original packaging, believed to have come from the surplus stock of a foreign government. So that potential source of imported firearms must also be of concern.
<P>

<a name="30129-19_para37"></a>I have proposed this new clause now to give the Government an opportunity to put on the record the approach that they intend to take to the problem of firearms which are already in the United Kingdom and the conversion of replica weapons and airguns. The amendment seeks to prompt an explanation from the Government of what work they and the law enforcement agencies are carrying out to stop guns coming into the United Kingdom from abroad. I think that that objective puts the provision very firmly within the scope of the Bill. It is also a call for the Government to address the issue of creating a long-term strategy to prevent firearms getting into this <P>

<A NAME="30129-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The use and carrying of unlawful guns is clearly a rapidly growing problem which, in recent months, has become increasingly serious in many of our cities and across the country. I therefore certainly welcome and support Amendment No. 139A. The Government must plainly see that effective international co-operation is an important step. Although there is, unfortunately, a very large supply of weapons already in the United Kingdom, there is every possibility that those dealing in these awful things may seek to import them from abroad as well. I, too, certainly hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more about the Government's plans for co-operation in preventing the inward trade of weapons from foreign countries into the United Kingdom.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   I shall be very interested in the reply to this timely and useful amendment. If the Committee does not mind, I should like to go back to 1997, when there were two firearms Bills, which subsequently became two firearms Acts. Some of us who opposed those Bills, which penalised decent innocent people, pointed to the fact that the real danger was from smuggled arms. We urged both governments at the time&#151;a Conservative government followed by a Labour government&#151;to concentrate on stopping the importation of illegal arms rather than penalising the decent, honest citizens who wished to have pistols for their sport of shooting.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para0"></a>Now the innocent have been punished, but the guns are still coming in and will continue to come in from all over the world. They are being smuggled not only from places such as Russia, where virtually everybody seems to own a gun, but from France and Switzerland, where gun laws are much more lenient than here. It is essential that the Government turn their attention to the issue. Let us not make any mistake about the fact that this will need additional staff. We will need more Customs officers and more police on the streets. However, it is essential to deal with the real problem and to catch the guilty rather than punish the innocent, which I fear is what will be done in response to the recent shocking shootings in a couple of communities. We are not going to deal with the importation problem. Instead, we are going to stop the manufacture of replica weapons and the carrying of toy water pistols. Please forgive me for using the Committee to get this off my chest. The amendment gives an opportunity to remind the Committee and Parliament of the mistakes that have been made in the past and to put those mistakes right now, to ensure that these awful weapons are not imported into this country, where they can be used illegally.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para1"></a>When we banned pistols, they were held legally by decent people. I hope we are not going to go along the same path. One way of ensuring that we do not is to take note of the amendment. I am sure that it will not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be pressed, although I would support it if it were. I think everyone in the Committee and far and wide shares the views expressed in the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   I suppose I should declare an interest, although it seems rather remote, as president of the Sussex Rifle Club. For reasons given by other noble Lords, I fully support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am glad of the opportunity to respond to the amendment, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, gives the Government an opportunity to put on the record what they are doing about this issue and to trail some of the wider measures that she indicated an interest in as potential elements of the Criminal Justice Bill when it comes before this House. I shall do so.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para2"></a>Clearly, we are utterly committed to working with our international partners to prevent the unlawful importation of arms and to minimise the use of the many weapons already in this country. We would be foolish if that were not so. I know the former from my direct role as the Home Office's EU Minister. A regular topic of conversation is how we can better work with our international partners and other member states to try to address our domestic challenges. That is the central thrust of our thinking in Europe. We want to use Europe to address our domestic problems rather than some more utopian objectives.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para3"></a>We already have some of the toughest gun controls in the world. We have been working with the police to ensure good security of legally held weapons to prevent them being stolen. We are looking at the need to establish stricter controls on deactivation standards. We want the same standards to apply throughout Europe. We have been working closely with the European Commission to that end.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para4"></a>UK law enforcement agencies represent us on the United Nations panel of experts for small arms and light weapons tracing and marking. The UN protocol resulting from this work is expected to lead to tighter controls. We also sit on the EU small arms policy committee.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para5"></a>The National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service are playing a key role in the intelligence-led approach to gun crime in London as elsewhere. NCIS has a national firearms tracing service that provides intelligence on the source and use of guns used in crime. This will be complemented by a new national computerised forensic firearms intelligence database, set up with funding from the Home Office. This is to be run within the Forensic Science Service. It will help to track the provenance of guns and ammunition used in crime and will be able to identify any links with a gun that may have been used in a number of crimes.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para6"></a>The objectives of the National Criminal Intelligence Service already require it to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provide high quality assessments and actionable intelligence in order to increase disruption of criminal enterprises engaged in other forms of serious and organised crime . . . and maximise mutual support and co-operation with law enforcement agencies at . . . international level".
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para7"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
It is already an explicit part of the service's objectives and responsibilities, as well it should be. Similarly, the National Crime Squad is tasked,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to dismantle or disrupt criminal enterprises engaged in other forms of serious and organised crime . . . maximising co-operation with law enforcement agencies at . . . international levels".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-20_para8"></a>
The national policing plan identifies gun crime as a high priority for the police and refers to the critical role they play in tackling it.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para9"></a>More specifically, in addition to the collaborative work with our partner law enforcement agencies, NCIS and NCS and intelligence agencies in-country work to improve our knowledge and understanding of the many complex issues that result in what has increasingly been happening on our streets. We are also working collaboratively in the international context. That includes actively seeking out examples of best practice all over the world from those who face or have faced similar issues. Promulgating and sharing intelligence is frequently the best way of targeting law enforcement resources. It also includes shared operations with international partners.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para10"></a>The FCO, HMCE, DfID and other agencies are assisting governments and law enforcement agencies in those countries that are at the head of the chain and are the source of many of the problems that we are experiencing on our streets, and those that are the major transit areas through which the criminal commodities pass on their way to markets in the UK and western Europe. For example, assistance to countries such as Jamaica, Turkey, the Balkan states, Columbia and Pakistan comprises training; funding for necessary equipment; and help in drawing up appropriate legislation and seeking to reduce the supply at source and taking out of play the major players, disrupting their activities at all stages of the chain. Those are all major objectives, as, especially, is seizing the illegally gained assets. They are being actively pursued directly and through bilateral agreements with other EU member states, the various UN bodies or other countries.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked some other questions about what else has been done or will be done. She will know that the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 introduced the toughest gun laws in any democracy. That was followed by a 10 per cent drop in the number of homicides. Unfortunately, since then a new pattern of gun crime and gang wars has emerged, usually highly related to extensive patterns of drug abuse in our society. Many of us are especially concerned about that. Some 60 per cent of gun crimes are related to gang feuds in our cities.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para12"></a>To give one example of how that is being tackled, the Metropolitan Police's Operation Trident is a major initiative to crack down on London's black communities where there has been extensive gun crime activity. I shall not give full details, but as of January 2002, 200 suspects had been arrested and charged, 130 guns seized and 500 kilos of class A drugs seized. Operation Trident has increased the detection rate of gun crimes to 80 per cent in those areas, which has been extremely encouraging.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para13"></a>The Criminal Justice Bill will introduce a mandatory minimum sentence for possession of illegal firearms. We are introducing a ban on the import, manufacture, sale and unlicensed possession of tandem cartridge systems. We are tightening the law on air guns. Going outside the Bill for a minute, following the gun crime summit Her Majesty's Customs and Excise are to undertake a major mapping of supply of weapons and are to be given new powers to prevent the illegal import of banned weapons. We are also working closely with the police to ensure better enforcement of existing legislation. A comprehensive review of all firearms legislation is also being implemented. That will examine whether there is more primary legislation than necessary. Lastly, the National Criminal Intelligence Service is expanding its firearms section significantly in the light of these threats.
<P>

<a name="30129-20_para14"></a>No one pretends that the scale of these threats means that we can be certain that these measures alone will do everything that can be done. We shall return to those issues when the Criminal Justice Bill comes before the House. The only point that I want to mark is that, while we fully respect the probing amendment giving an opportunity almost for a preliminary Second Reading debate on some of these issues before we come back to them later, the duties that it would impose already exist in practice in the operational forces that are challenged with dealing with the issues. The Government could not be more committed to using international efforts to reinforce our domestic efforts to grip the problem. For these reasons, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I hope the Minister will bear in mind the powerful speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. Looking back over the years, our reaction has often been to put far tighter controls on those who are legally in possession of guns, when the real problem has always been the amount of illegally held guns that have been flooding through the country. I hope the Government will bear that in mind in any legislation that they bring forward.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para0"></a>On a Question in the House the other day, some Members were confessing to having changed their mind on these matters. The one point on which I disagreed with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was his comment about replica guns. This came up in, I think, 1970, when I was a junior Minister in the Home Office. We had a delegation from the gun lobby telling us to take more seriously the issue of replica guns coming into this country. I suspect that we did not give their arguments the careful consideration that they deserved. We may have thought that they were trying to turn the argument to another aspect of gun control. What we now know about replica guns and the ease with which they are converted to real lethal weapons means that we ought to have control over them.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para1"></a>Finally, I was disappointed beyond words to hear the Minister repeat that the Government were intending to go ahead with mandatory minimum sentences. I do not believe they will do any good. They will simply lead to unfairness, as mandatory <P>


<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentencing will always do in the long run. They remove flexibility. On hearing the answers of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General and of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, in a recent debate, I had hoped that the Government were beginning to accept that flexibility was a necessary element in a court's sentencing powers if injustice is to be avoided. When there is already a maximum sentence of life for carrying a gun with intent to commit some other offence, a mandatory sentence of three years will make no difference. A mandatory sentence of three years on conviction for being in possession of a gun in circumstances that are currently tried merely in the magistrates' court seems to be equally out of line.

<A NAME="30129-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   We are discussing a new clause dealing with firearms. It has been well supported by a number of Members of the Committee. But it is surely in the national interest that we should consider weapons of mass destruction of various kinds. It would be a tragedy if the British people were protected by a clause dealing only with firearms. Between now and Report the Government should apply their minds to the broader issue. I hope that I am not out of order in referring to that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Stoddart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for their support. I am grateful also for the interventions by my noble friends Lord Renton and Lord Carlisle. My noble friend Lord Carlisle raised the important issue of mandatory sentences. We shall have some difficult and interesting discussions on that subject when we debate the Criminal Justice Bill. He was right to focus on it.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para2"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said in his remarkable and welcome speech, governments of both persuasions have perhaps not always taken the course that they might have done had they thought about these matters for slightly longer. We are left with a situation where huge numbers of illegal firearms are imported, and the Government face a very difficult task in trying to ensure that their importation is stopped. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, also raised the important question of the resources that will be involved in ensuring that our borders can be properly secured against the importation of arms.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para3"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton raised the issue of other weapons. I wonder whether the Export Control Act, which completed its passage at about this time last year, might cover that. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to my noble friend on that point between now and Report. There may be provisions which address the point, but they may not address all his concerns.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para4"></a>I should be grateful if, between now and Report, the Minister might answer one detailed question. I was intrigued by his helpful description of international co-operation on matters of best practice. He referred to what we hope will be best practice in this country; <P>


<a name="column_GC198"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>namely, the creation of an intelligence database tracking guns used in crime. Will the tracking of those guns relate only to crimes committed in this country, or will our agencies have access to information on guns used in crimes overseas? Will that be part of the exchange of information? I do not expect an answer today, but it would be helpful in the context of this Bill, and, more particularly, in our debates on the Criminal Justice Bill.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para5"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Carlisle that the issue of mandatory sentences will be a tough one. The Government will have to come up with some persuasive answers and a cogent argument about how these will be put into practice if the Bill is not to have a bumpy ride through this House.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para6"></a>I am grateful for the care and attention that all Members of the Committee have given to this proposed new clause. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="30129-21_para8"></a>Clauses 81 and 82 agreed to.

<a name="30129-21_para9"></a>Clause 83 [Foreign surveillance operations]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin </B>   moved Amendment No. 139B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 55, line 13, leave out from "circumstances" to "an" in line 14 and insert "for a United Kingdom officer to carry out the surveillance in the United Kingdom in accordance with"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-21_para10"></a><P>

<a name="30129-21_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: Before speaking specifically to the government amendment itself, as this is our first opportunity to discuss Clause 83, and as it may aid some of our subsequent discussions, I wondered whether it might help if I set out some of the essential features of Clause 83 and explain why we think that the provision is right, necessary and proportionate. The provision is meant essentially to enhance co-operation so that British police forces are better able to obtain evidence and apprehend those who committed crime, and whom they have under surveillance, in order to bring them to justice.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para12"></a>From our perspective, at heart, the measures will deal with circumstances which have occurred in the past whereby people under surveillance by the British police forces have crossed the Channel and contact with them was lost, frustrating the police's ability to collect the evidence that they thought might assist in bringing prosecutions and convictions. The same is true in reverse. There have been occasions when our neighbours on the Continent had people under surveillance whom they believed had committed an offence. They thought it necessary to continue that covert surveillance in order to collect further evidence for a prosecution. When the people crossed into this country, our neighbours were unable to pursue.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para13"></a>To take it more sharply, most of the cross-border operations will be brought in as a result of the Bill and implementation of Article 40.2 of the Schengen convention. Let me illustrate how the operations will work in practice. Most of the cross-border operations that come from the EU into this country will be pre-planned and authorised in advance. We expect that the vast majority will be of that nature. I am slightly labouring the point because, in pre-planned operations, the surveillance operation will be taken <P>


<a name="column_GC199"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over by British forces&#151;in practice, the National Crime Squad&#151;upon the suspect's entry to the UK. We expect that that is what will happen in the vast majority of cases.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para14"></a>There are, however, urgent cases&#151;the focus of this clause and this issue&#151;where it is not always possible to get either the authorisation or the authorisation and a UK surveillance team in place at the port in time to take over the surveillance operation. It is about putting in place highly limited and circumscribed regulations which, in such tightly circumscribed circumstances, allow the surveillance to continue in the United Kingdom for a limited time, until such time as British police forces can take over the surveillance. So it applies only when it is not possible to get a British force to take over the surveillance immediately, and then only in very tightly circumscribed circumstances. I shall try to illustrate those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para15"></a>Foreign officers cannot operate here until they have requested assistance&#151;as soon as it seems probable that the suspects they are following will be crossing into the United Kingdom. So there is a duty to notify NCIS as soon as it seems probable that their suspect will be coming to the United Kingdom. They must also notify NCIS as soon as they have arrived in the United Kingdom. I stress again that that applies only when it has not been possible to arrange through advance notification a joint investigatory team or a UK force at the point of entry. NCIS will be the point of contact for all requests and will authorise or refuse the operation. They have the right of refusal. The National Crime Squad or a local force will be notified by NCIS, and will identify officers to link up with the incoming foreign officers as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para16"></a>The period for which foreign officers may operate alone is strictly limited under the Schengen convention, and under the Bill's provisions, to five hours. There is a maximum of five hours to allow time for the British police forces to take over the surveillance. If they have not done so within that period, surveillance must stop. The UK may require foreign officers to stop at any time within the five hours. So, having given authorisation, they can rescind it if they think it appropriate to do so at any time within that period.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para17"></a>I shall labour the next point because it is germane. Foreign officers may not carry their firearms. They will be prohibited from bringing their guns into the United Kingdom. They may not enter private property. They may not challenge or arrest a suspect. They must submit a report of every operation in which they have entered the United Kingdom at short notice. In all those circumstances, even though it will not always be possible to put in a UK force before they come in, they must notify NCIS before their feet touch UK soil. So we will know that they are coming; we will know who is coming; and we will authorise their entry. We will simply be allowing them to continue for a short period in the very limited number of circumstances where it has not been possible to get our own surveillance forces into place in time. I hope that the Committee will bear with me in setting out those issues, as we are bound to revert to them on subsequent <P>


<a name="column_GC200"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments. It is the novelty of leading on these amendments rather than responding to them that has led me to behave in that way.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para18"></a>The purpose of the amendment is straightforward. It allows officers from other countries to carry out under tight conditions lawful surveillance of a person suspected of a serious crime. I emphasise that we are talking about only serious criminal offences, not minor offences or misdemeanours. We are making the changes as part of our wider commitment to fight international crime with our EU partners. It will allow better co-operation at every instance. The measure is supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Other EU countries have been running Schengen arrangements on cross-border surveillance for years. They have managed to make them work well despite some shared difficult histories.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para19"></a>I shall now discuss the substance of the amendments. In the Explanatory Notes, we outlined why foreign officers should be allowed to continue surveillance into the UK, in particular to take account of the time needed to mobilise a UK surveillance team. In reviewing the text of the Bill in response to the proposed amendments from Committee Members, we realised that the text of the Bill as it stands would not allow for situations where the UK authorities are notified before the team enters the UK. These amendments ensure that the five-hour period applies not only where it is not reasonably practicable for foreign officers to make an advance request; it applies also where an advance request is made from abroad but it is not reasonably practicable for our authorities to secure the necessary authorisation before the foreign officers reach the UK. The amendments will also cover cases where a request is made from abroad, and the surveillance by UK officers is authorised in advance, but it is not reasonably practicable for those UK officers physically to take over the surveillance when the foreign officers enter the UK.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para20"></a>Amendment No. 154A simply defines "United Kingdom officer" for the purposes of Amendment No. 139B. The police, Customs, the NCIS or the NCS will take over this sort of surveillance. It also includes the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, formerly the Scottish Crime Squad, and anyone who might take over their functions. The wording of the amendment is needed to ensure that Section 76A would cover any other body that might be established under any future collaborative agreements between the Scottish police forces. It will perform the same functions as the SDEA.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para21"></a>We consider that all those cases should count as urgent cases covered by Article 40.2 of Schengen. We do not want to run the risk of being unable to take over surveillance operations because of unforeseen and insurmountable difficulties in getting UK officers to the port within the hour or two it might take for an officer to cross from Calais. The consequences of that might be that important criminal suspects would be allowed to enter the UK without supervision. I cannot believe that the Committee would wish that to happen.

<a name="30129-21_para22"></a>I may respond further to questions from the Committee. I hope that I have set out the broad picture of why we think these measures are essential. I have had to weary the Committee with these amendments simply to ensure that the measures were effective in all respects. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30129-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The Minister opened his speech about the principles underlying Clause 83 in general terms. As he is aware from comments made from these Benches at Second Reading, we have concerns about the operation of the powers of surveillance. He puts the argument in the context that there is a quid pro quo and that if our police forces are engaged in surveillance that they consider necessary to continue across the Channel, they will wish to have the ability to carry that forward.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para23"></a>We want to ensure that it is possible for criminals who have no respect for borders to be hunted down by democracies whose police forces must have respect for borders. We do not object in principle to what the Government are trying to achieve, but we want to ensure that the quid pro quo is not achieved at too high a price. That is what our amendments are aimed at.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para24"></a>I have a couple of questions. The first relates to the generality of the Minister's introduction. I may have misunderstood something that he said. He rightly explained that the vast majority of operations would be pre-planned and would be taken over by our police in this country. He said that the Bill would cover the rest. They would be small in number, but they might be significant in themselves. The Minister then said, I think, that advance notice would always be given before the officers carrying out the surveillance set foot in this country. That is not what I understood to be the case from the Bill or from the Explanatory Notes.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para25"></a>I understood that they would be able to travel to the country even if they had been unable to give prior notice and give notice once they were in the country. I may have misunderstood the explanation given at Second Reading and the way in which the Explanatory Notes set it out. If so, I would be grateful to be put right by the Minister. Before setting foot in this country to carry out surveillance, must a foreign officer who is not accompanied by an officer from a police force in England, Scotland or Wales have given notification? He will have five hours during which he will not have such permission and will be waiting for it, but must he have made the application before one foot steps on British soil?
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para26"></a>The Minister referred to other matters that, we thought, were not sufficiently clear in the Bill. We will come to the relevant amendments later. The Minister said categorically that foreign officers would be prohibited from carrying guns, entering private property or making a challenge. Our amendments would create clarity in the Bill similar to the clarity of the Minister's pledge.
<P>

<a name="30129-21_para27"></a>When I read the amendment, I wondered whether there might not still be a problem with it. If it is manifestly impossible for a United Kingdom officer to <P>


<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>carry out surveillance but it is still possible for telephone calls to be made for authorisation under Part 2 of RIPA, would not the amendment remove the threshold for that? I do not necessarily expect an answer today, but I would be grateful if the Minister could write to me or if we could address it on Report. When such amendments are presented to the Committee new and fresh, it is difficult for us to seize on the details of the Government's explanation and ask the right questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I shall follow my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns by asking exactly what degree of reciprocity there is in the clause. As I understand it, the Minister said that we were providing the new right to surveillance in this country because we were implementing the Schengen convention. Have all the other signatories to the convention signed up to the new right of surveillance? Does our police force have similar rights in those countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We are having a preliminary debate on the surveillance provisions of Clauses 83 to 85, which are in some ways the most controversial element in the Bill. I should make clear that we, as indeed does the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, support the principle behind this form of surveillance. Co-operation on surveillance, as on other matters, is we believe of great importance.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para0"></a>In Article 40 of the 1990 convention, which implements the Schengen agreement, the power of hot surveillance is more likely to be used on mainland Europe than in the United Kingdom because of obvious geographical issues that arise. It is easy and quick nowadays to cross a border in mainland Europe from one member state to another, whereas in this country&#151;with the exception of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, to which, as I understand it, Article 40 does not apply&#151;the only way in, whether by boat, aeroplane or by the Channel Tunnel, involves a fair amount of time. Therefore, mostly there will be a chance to notify the authorities in advance and to get someone from a police force in the UK to carry out the surveillance here. I would be interested to know how often the Government expect that these powers will need to be used.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para1"></a>We are particularly concerned to note that a number of the limitations which are contained in Articles 40.2 and 40.3 are not set out on the face of the Bill. The Government have announced their intention that they should be observed, but we feel that they should be on the face of the Bill. That is why the relevant amendments stand in the name of my noble friend Lord Dholakia as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. We shall support, in particular, the amendments which seek to place these restrictions on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para2"></a>It was suggested at Second reading that the Government did not wish to see such amendments on the face of the Bill because they were anticipating further changes to the 1990 convention and it might therefore be more convenient if these matters were <P>


<a name="column_GC203"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simply dealt with by means of regulations. We should be unlikely to be happy with that, if it is indeed the reason why the Government do not want the full level of restrictions under Article 40 to be on the face of the Bill. This power of surveillance, even if used relatively infrequently, will be controversial and intrusive. Therefore, we think it highly desirable that the restrictions should be on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   It was most helpful of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to give a general overview of these clauses. The Committee will welcome the fact that there will be a complete prohibition on the carrying of firearms. Since there is a general prohibition for our own police, it would be absurd if foreign policemen could come to this country with firearms. I should like to know exactly how the restriction will be enforced.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para3"></a>At Second Reading, I raised the problem of a foreign policeman who has a gun and who is in hot pursuit of a criminal having to discard that gun somewhere on his way over here. How and where will he do it? Will he dump it in the sea, chuck it out of the Eurostar window or what? I should welcome further information. It is also good to know that foreign police may not enter private property&#151;that is the subject of an amendment which I hope the Government will accept&#151;and that they may not arrest people.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para4"></a>As I understand it, these provisions do not apply to the Irish Republic; so IRA people who bomb in Northern Ireland and flee to the south will not be able to be hotly pursued by British policeman. Is that right? Perhaps the noble Lord could tell us later.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para5"></a>The Minister referred to operations being pre-planned. Has he any idea exactly how many such operations there will be&#151;tens, fifties, hundreds, or thousands? It would be useful to know, because we should like to know just how many foreign policemen would be operating in Britain at any given time. That is important.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para6"></a>If someone is in hot pursuit&#151;say, from the Continent, America or anywhere else where we have an arrangement&#151;and arrives in this country, I am not quite sure how the person knows who to get in touch with. It is not only a central intelligence agency that needs to know; the local police also need to know, because they are responsible in their own area. It would be useful to know how that is to be achieved and how the five-hour limit will be enforced. For example, when the chap is chasing someone along a road and the five-hour period expires, what happens then? Or what happens if he thinks, "Never mind about the international agreement, I have to go on". How is this provision to be supervised? How is discipline to be enforced? We ought to know.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para7"></a>Finally, I am not sure whether the agreement that we have made with other countries allows the five-hour period to be extended without the introduction of further primary legislation. We ought also to know that. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer all these questions.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The Minister assured us that such hot pursuit would happen only in the case of someone suspected of serious crime. He said that foreign officers would not be allowed to carry guns, nor to enter private property. I was unclear how we would know that. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised that point, but I did not know whether those points were set out in previous legislation. Is that what he is telling us?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I hope to assist the Minister. In his general introduction to this clause, he has opened up the issue rather more widely than the Government might have anticipated at this stage, given that a substantial number of amendments are to follow. However, Committee Members have very properly seized the opportunity to ask questions.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para8"></a>Perhaps I may assist the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, who asked about the carrying of firearms. We hope to probe the Government closely on Amendment No. 148, which would prohibit the carrying of firearms by a foreign police officer or a Customs officer. We have further amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 153 and 154&#151;that concern the period during which foreign officers may carry out surveillance within this country. I assure the Minister that when I asked for clarification on his statement that all applications must be made before a foreign officer's foot stepped on this soil, I sought only clarification. I do not expect him to go into any detailed explanation of the policy. Obviously, we shall probe those issues when we come to our amendments. We shall try to require not only that the application be made, but that permission should have been granted before the surveillance may continue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have spoken. As they have signalled, I, in seeking to set the scene, inevitably opened up discussions on forthcoming amendments that will be considered later. Nevertheless, perhaps I may give some initial responses, as far as I am able, to as many points as I can. That may assist our subsequent consideration of future amendments. However, noble Lords deserve a reply, if I can give one.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para9"></a>I turn to the first question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, concerning advance notice or prior notification. There are two circumstances. First, when an operation is pre-planned, clearly, the foreign force is expecting something to happen. Therefore, they telephone the National Criminal Intelligence Service, and there is plenty of time to put in place a UK surveillance operation. That situation is clear. The noble Baroness was correct in saying that I was not simply referring to that situation. I was also referring to the urgent situations when it has not been possible to put in place a plan to take over the surveillance.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para10"></a>As the noble Baroness rightly observed, foreign officers will be expected to request assistance as soon as it seems probable that the suspects they are following will cross into the UK. That will be our general expectation; as soon as the foreign officers are <P>


<a name="column_GC205"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aware of that situation arising, they will make contact. In strict legality, they could board the ferry and continue the surveillance into the United Kingdom. As I signalled earlier, and will come to on subsequent amendments, immediately the foreign officers arrive in the United Kingdom they would have to give notification of their presence.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para11"></a>Those circumstances are expected to be few because, while the foreign officers are waiting for their car or whatever to be loaded on to a ferry or a hovercraft, it would be relatively simple to call NCIS on the telephone number in their Schengen handbook and notify it of their arrival.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, also asked a technical question on which she had the grace to signal that she would like a written answer. That I shall give. The question of other Schengen countries was also raised. Please bear with me if I am unable to spot exactly who asked which question. The position is that all other Schengen countries, apart from Ireland, are signed up to the convention. It is not new; the Schengen system has been in operation since 1990.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is right in saying that surveillance&#151;it is surveillance to which we are referring and not hot pursuit, which I shall turn to later&#151;is much more likely to be used in mainland Europe, for the reasons that he accurately observed. Because of the delay in crossing the Channel, the likelihood is increased of being able to put a UK surveillance team into position at the point of entry of the suspect being tailed. That does not apply to Ireland, which does not want to participate in Article 40 of Schengen&#151;that is entirely a matter for the Irish Government, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, correctly surmised.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para14"></a>How often would the measure be used? It is hard to judge, but for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, one would expect that most circumstances would be pre-planned and pre-arranged, rather than having to take advantage of the particular circumstances that we are debating under this clause.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para15"></a>The limitations of the measures are important; I have signalled them. Clearly, they will be put into legislative force. We intend to do that through secondary legislation. For recollection, in virtually all cases, they will be by the affirmative procedure. But we shall return to those measures in more detail subsequently.
<P>

<a name="30129-22_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked about firearms. The foreign officers will be aware that they must deposit their guns within their own country. That is for two reasons. First, it will be in the Schengen handbook&#151; surveillance officers will be expected to carry a copy. The handbook will set out the rules of entry to the UK. Secondly, it is such&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;a highly apparent issue that it is hard to believe that a French or a Belgian officer would not be aware that they were prohibited from bringing their gun into this country. On the mechanism of doing so, we would expect gun-carrying foreign officers to hand over their <P>


<a name="column_GC206"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gun to an appropriate official at the embarkation port while waiting to board the ferry. I can see no reason whatever why they could not do that.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030129/text/30129-23.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Perhaps I should give the Government the opportunity to think about this situation before we reach the firearms amendment. This is a matter that I raised with the Minister when he was kind enough to have a meeting with officials and noble Lords. Does the Minister not foresee circumstances where foreign officers are very properly involved in surveillance in which they are, themselves, under cover? Therefore, it would not be safe for them to carry out the procedure as laid down. In other words, in front of a gang of which they were a part, a foreign officer could not exactly say, "Excuse me while I stop and deposit my gun before I join you on the illegal boat that we are using to cross the Channel". Will those circumstances be taken into account in the firearms amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall take advantage of the notice rather than respond immediately. We believe that there are practical solutions and that it would be perfectly possible to do so.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para0"></a>Should there be breaches, they will be dealt with in the same way as any other breach of firearms law by UK citizens. If a foreign policeman came into the country in the circumstances described, carrying his firearm covertly, he would be in breach of UK law and, as a consequence, would be open to UK prosecution. In such a situation, he could and would be arrested.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para1"></a>In many circumstances, the suspect may be in a car and the police officer also in a car. The relevance is that it is sometimes operationally difficult to put in place sufficient covert UK police cars to take up the surveillance&#151;it is not a chase&#151;immediately. It cannot be done with just one covert police car. I said that it was not hot pursuit merely for clarification. Hot pursuit is a term to be used when police officers are pursuing a suspect with a view to arrest. That is not what we are referring to; we are referring to the continuation of surveillance operations.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para2"></a>How will the five-hour period be enforced and supervised? Again, as soon as foreign police officers put a foot on British soil, they would be expected to notify NCIS. In most cases, we would expect to be notified from the other side of the Channel. Therefore, we would know the start period of when they are due to arrive and would add five hours to that. If they continued their operation, it would be without legality. They would have no legal authority to operate after the expiry of those five hours, or any shorter period that NCIS has imposed. A question was asked concerning the extension of the five-hour period. There is no intention to extend the five hours. In theoretical circumstances, it would need primary legislation if we changed our mind.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, asked what are the serious crimes. They are set out in Article 40.7 of the Schengen convention. Perhaps I may put them on the record now, even though we may touch on them later. Serious crimes are limited to a number of <P>


<a name="column_GC207"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>generic offences, all of a serious nature. They are murder, manslaughter, rape, arson, counterfeiting, armed robbery and receiving stolen goods, extortion, kidnapping and hostage-taking, trafficking of human beings, elicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, breach of the laws on arms and explosives, use of explosives, and illicit transportation of toxic and dangerous waste.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para4"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will say that there are one or two points that I have not answered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Just before leaving that point; I did not actually ask what the crimes were. I asked how we know that it is only serious crime. How do we know that the police cannot carry arms or go on to private property? Is that all in the framework agreement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   It will all be in the Schengen handbook, in which we shall have the right to set out the operational effect of UK legislation on applying the framework agreement. Effectively, in the Schengen handbook&#151;I wait to be corrected if I am wrong&#151;there will be a British section which states, "You cannot do X, Y and Z".
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para5"></a>The further question asked by the noble Baroness was how will we know that they are following the regulations. In strict&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My question was really relevant to my noble friend's forthcoming amendments. If the Minister says that the amendments are not necessary, he will say that all those facts are known. The Minister said that he could assure us that this would occur only as a result of serious crime. He assured us that foreign officers would not go into private property and that they would not carry guns. What is the basis of the Minister's assurance? I believe that I am being told that all that information is in the handbook. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   You are being told that all that information will be in the handbook. It will be in the handbook as a consequence of us legislating through primary and secondary legislation to make that the application of the convention, which will then give us the right to put those conditions into the Schengen handbook. The handbook will then be a legal obligation on foreign forces, in the limited circumstances that we are describing, to obey when they enter this country. Effectively, the Schengen handbook will be an operational expression of the law that they must obey, if they are not to be in breach of the law.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para6"></a>I turn now to further points. Clause 76A(3) covers that point. It states that "relevant crime" means crime which falls within Article 40.7 of the Schengen convention. I can send the noble Baroness a copy, if that answers her point. However, I am not sure whether it does.
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30129-23_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment stands also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. The discussion on the previous group of government amendments has been very helpful in telescoping some of the debate that we shall have on the individual amendments as they arise.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para12"></a>Amendment No. 140 would place on the face of the Bill the wording of the Home Office's description of the United Kingdom's intent in acceding to Article 40 in its own commentary on the Schengen convention in the letter from the right honourable Jack Straw to the presidency of the Council, requesting United Kingdom accession to Schengen, as given to the Lords European Select Committee and printed at annex 2 to its fifth report of 1999&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para13"></a>The letter states in respect of Article 40:
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Clause 83 implements the requirement of Article 40.2 of the Schengen convention for officers from one member state to be allowed to cross a border to conduct unaccompanied surveillance in another Schengen member state for up to five hours in exceptional circumstances when the subject has unexpectedly entered the other member state. When the UK applied to participate in Schengen, we chose to opt into this provision because UK law enforcement sees it as a key operational development.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para16"></a>Clause 83 simply ensures that the surveillance that the foreign officers will be carrying out is lawful. We do not expect these situations to arise very often. I touched on these points in previous explanations. We believe that our participation in the Schengen convention arrangements on cross-border surveillance will help to block the loophole where, currently, people coming into the United Kingdom can disappear and traces can be lost, and the reverse happening when we <P>


<a name="column_GC209"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been seeking to keep suspected criminals under surveillance with a view to collecting information for a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para17"></a>The amendment, which I recognise as probing would limit these conditions by amending the definition of "reasonably practicable". It would narrow the circumstances in which this type of surveillance was allowed, so it would be "reasonably practicable" for a foreign officer not to request surveillance in advance only if his travel time to the UK would be less than the time that it would take to seek prior authorisation.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para18"></a>Enforcing such a condition would be very difficult. It may be helpful if I explain what we mean by "reasonably practicable". It includes other circumstances besides timing which might prevent prior authorisation being sought. Although it may seem slightly bizarre, it is, for instance, conceivable that an officer might be unable to make contact because of a dead battery in a mobile phone or a radio. Also&#151;and more usually&#151;circumstances might be such that there was not sufficient time both to secure the authorisation in the UK and to arrange for the UK team to take over the surveillance.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para19"></a>The amendment fails to take account of the complexity of mounting surveillance operations at short notice. It would impede the UK's ability to undertake its own cross-border surveillance operations, and to assist Schengen partners with theirs.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para20"></a>Consultation with the operational agencies and the practical implementation of Article 40.2 identified that in view of the UK's wish to take over the handling of all foreign surveillance operations entering the UK, situations would arise which would make implementation difficult if we continued to maintain our original approach.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para21"></a>For example, identification of the appropriate operational agency force to take over the operation and for it to seek authorisation under RIPA may take longer than the time it takes to travel to the United Kingdom, even if we receive the request at the point at which the foreign team are embarking for the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30129-23_para22"></a>I hope that I have answered all the questions raised on this amendment.

<A NAME="30129-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I can well understand the Government's approach. They are attempting to ensure that surveillance can continue in cases where serious crime is being investigated, and that surveillance will not be hampered unnecessarily. We are trying to ensure that the proper safety procedures are in place.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para0"></a>The Minister said that enforcing the proposal in the amendment would be difficult. We are not trying to prevent surveillance taking place when it is proper; but, as the Minister is aware, prior authorisation is our preferred option. We are trying to ensure that "where reasonably practicable", that is the right way to go forward.

<a name="30129-24_para1"></a>If this surveillance power is to be exercised, it must be in circumstances where foreign officers&#151;and indeed British officers carrying out their duties overseas&#151;are carrying out these procedures in the best possible way. Their practices must be water-tight. They must not see this merely as the easy option.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para2"></a>I was disappointed, therefore, that the Minister sought to justify this procedure by saying that it could be the case that someone had a dead telephone battery. I jolly well hope that if these people are carrying out such important international investigations they will charge up their batteries. That was the weakest part of the Minister's argument. I shall take other parts of his argument far more seriously between now and Report. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="30129-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 141:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 55, line 25, after "party" insert "and which is an offence under the law of any part of the United Kingdom,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-24_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30129-24_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment stands also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para6"></a>The amendment would require the relevant crime being investigated by foreign officers under the powers given by the clause to be an offence under United Kingdom law where it is one specified by order by the Secretary of State, with the consent of Scottish Ministers, rather than one already specified in the Schengen convention.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para7"></a>All the crimes listed in Article 40.7 of the Schengen convention appear to satisfy this test. But that does not appear to be the case for new Section 76A(3)(b), which allows the Secretary of State to specify further crimes by order. I am trying to ascertain what kind of offences that are not crimes in the UK might be investigated by foreign officers on our soil as a result of these provisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The amendment&#151;which I recognise is probing&#151;would seek to restrict any subsequent extension of these arrangements to agreements other than the Schengen convention. It would mean that if we wanted to enable this type of surveillance to be carried out in respect of another international agreement besides the Schengen convention, we could do so only if the crimes specified within that further agreement were also crimes in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para8"></a>Subsection (3)(b) gives the Government flexibility should we wish to join a new international agreement that included provisions on cross-border surveillance. It is likely that any such agreement would take a similar approach to Schengen and refer to generic offences.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para9"></a>The Committee will be aware that, even where progress has been made in reaching agreement on the definition of an offence in European Union instruments, variations still occur when these are adapted at national level, and it is often good that they do so. Generic descriptions of offences enable member states to take account of variations of detail and they enable international agreements to be reached without the need for harmonisation of the offences covered.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para10"></a>One can see where the alternative takes us: to have effective international co-operation, one would be on a slippery slope towards seeing the need for harmonisation of laws. That is not the United Kingdom's position. We are opposed to that, but build our co-operation on the principle of mutual recognition.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para11"></a>Our resistance to the amendment is not any sort of attempt to evade parliamentary scrutiny. Any EU agreement that might be covered by this clause would be deposited for scrutiny by the relevant committee of both Houses, which would provide the opportunity to raise any concerns about its scope.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para12"></a>Broader international agreements would also be subject to parliamentary oversight before they could be ratified. In response to the invitation to identify a specific example&#151;which is possibly dangerous&#151;rather than merely illustrating why we believe the generic terms are the right way forward, perhaps I may give an example. In a case where a United Kingdom police officer was seeking to keep under surveillance someone whom he or she believed had been involved in child molestation or child pornography, our laws would be tighter and stronger than those of some other countries and we would wish still to be able to have that pursuit continue without being limited by what would effectively be a dual criminality requirement&#151;which is clearly what a foreign state would expect if we were insisting that it had to be UK law.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para13"></a>For those various reasons, while respecting the nature of the probing amendment, we do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   The Minister said that any additions to the Schengen list would have to go through parliamentary procedure. Parliamentary procedure in this instance presumably means scrutiny by this House in particular and by another place.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para14"></a>We know perfectly well that scrutiny in either House means nothing. In the final analysis, if the Government have already made an agreement, whatever Parliament's decision, it does not matter. Indeed, if the discussions of both Houses are against one of the Government's proposals, that in no way binds the Government from making a decision in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para15"></a>Furthermore, even if Parliament disagrees with a proposal and the Government agree with Parliament and then take the matter to Europe, and the proposal is defeated by qualified majority voting, what Parliament says will mean nothing. Am I right? Or does Parliament really have a say in additions to the Schengen list?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The noble Lord invites me to go rather wide of the amendment in discussing the nature of legislative scrutiny of European agreements. Nevertheless, I shall make one or two points.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para16"></a>The foundation of scrutiny of European agreements is essentially based on pre-legislative scrutiny. It is based on the deposit before the relevant committee of each House of the working documents while they are in negotiation and before agreement has been reached. <P>


<a name="column_GC212"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That is the first stage of the process. Those who have taken part in it will know the vigour of that process, and what an influence it has on Ministers when they are considering the stance that they will take in Europe. I speak from direct personal experience of knowing beforehand what this House or another place may think of certain measures because they have seen them. I do not say that the system is perfect, but it works well. The second stage of scrutiny is when the measures are put into primary or secondary legislation by either House.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para17"></a>The formal position is that the Government may have made an agreement, but this House is sovereign. It makes its decision on such matters. The Government would be seriously embarrassed if they did not get their legislation through, but the House will make its decision as it wishes.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para18"></a>Qualified majority voting is not yet relevant for justice and home affairs issues. It may be in the future, but that is not the case at present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. Again, he is saying: "We want flexibility", and, "Let's trust parliamentary scrutiny", when we know, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, that in terms of parliamentary scrutiny, however good our best efforts are, they may not be the best that we should achieve. We get frustrated in those matters.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para19"></a>The Minister refers to the fact that the Government are opposed to the harmonisation of laws. He certainly has our support on that issue. We have concerns when he talks about generic descriptions of offences being the solution. As he knows, when the Government bring the Extradition Bill before this House, there will be debates on the definition of offences such as xenophobia, which appear to be generic in terms but which would not necessarily be applicable in this country. The Minister's explanation has not persuaded me not to return to the matter on Report. There are issues that I shall need to raise at that stage. Within the confines of Grand Committee, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

"( ) A foreign police or customs officer conducting relevant surveillance in the United Kingdom under this section shall ensure that such persons as may be designated by order made by the Secretary of State are immediately informed of the fact that the United Kingdom's border has been crossed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30129-24_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment stands also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. It replicates the provision in Article 40.2(a) of the Schengen convention regarding informing host authorities once the border has been crossed. Article 40.2(a) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where, for particularly urgent reasons, prior authorisation cannot be requested from the other Contracting Party, the officers carrying out the surveillance shall be authorised to continue <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-24_para23"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) the authority of the Contracting Party designated under paragraph 5, in whose territory the surveillance is to be continued, must be notified immediately, during the surveillance, that the border has been crossed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-24_para24"></a>
Surely, not only is that the right thing to do, but it promotes operational effectiveness, so that UK police forces will at least know that the foreign police or Customs officers are on their territory carrying out surveillance.
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para25"></a>Why is this provision in the Schengen convention, which is a condition of compliance, not on the face of the Bill? The Government state in paragraph 156 of the Explanatory Notes that they will make an order under the powers given in new Section 76A(4) incorporating these conditions into the requirements to be followed by foreign officers. Therefore, why not put them on the face of the Bill as they are mandatory provisions of Schengen?
<P>

<a name="30129-24_para26"></a>Finally, my practical question is: how shall we know when the border has been crossed? What will be the level of proof? I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am happy to support the amendment in principle. I should like to know where, for the purposes of the clause, the border is. The customary rule is that the border where there are countries on opposite sides of an arm of the sea, such as the North Sea or the Channel, is halfway between the two. Is that the point at which technically a country becomes bound to notify the authorities here of what is happening? In practice, I assume that it would notify them earlier anyway, even if that is the point at which the border is crossed.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para0"></a>I have a slight doubt about the way in which the amendment is framed. It seems that the information might be provided not by the people actually conducting the hot surveillance, but by their minders who would know what was happening and would transmit the information. That is a matter of detail. In principle, I am happy to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Both my noble friend and the Minister will know that there are many places on the coast of Scotland where one cannot use a mobile telephone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I had noticed. I always seem to go on holiday to places where one cannot use a mobile phone, but that may be my perversity.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para1"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, rightly says, the amendment reflects the condition set out in Article 40.2(a) of the Schengen convention, which states that foreign police and Customs officers conducting this type of surveillance must contact the relevant authority in the territory they are entering the moment they cross the border.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para2"></a>The requirement to make contact immediately is an important part of the cross-border arrangements, which is why we intend to specify that condition in the order. The order-making power will be subject to the affirmative procedure.
<P>


<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para3"></a>The provision is not on the face of the Bill because it is possible that, once we have some practical experience of the handling of this type of surveillance operation, we shall wish to add further conditions. The order-making power would allow us swifter access to Parliament to introduce further conditions if it was felt necessary. I hope the Committee feel that that is desirable to ensure that we have the tightest possible circumstances of control consistent with not frustrating the objective that we jointly seek to achieve.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para4"></a>As to how we shall know the border has been crossed&#151;perhaps it is related to the question of where the border is&#151;without straying into international law, about which I know nothing, operationally that will be hard to define. Therefore, we shall take the stance that as soon as the officers reach UK entry controls they will have to notify. Notwithstanding the comment of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that it may be difficult to communicate if one is keeping someone under surveillance, if one is on a ferry one's suspect will not escape while on that ferry; so it would be perfectly possible to notify the authorities in advance. Therefore, that does not have to be left to the last moment. It may be down to common sense.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para5"></a>The specific legal answer is that, we would say, if the officers went past the entry point they would have breached the agreement and the law. I trust that those remarks address the questions raised on the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I shall certainly consider what he has said between now and Report. The response from the Minister about where the border is and when someone shall be judged as having crossed the border was that the border will effectively be when he touches soil rather than where the territorial waters start. If that is the case, one could argue that if officers are carrying out surveillance in this country, having come from France, they will get five hours plus, whereas if they are carrying it out across the border from France to Belgium they will get five hours maximum. That is an interesting point that I had not thought of before because I had always thought that the five hours would start from where the territorial waters began and not when the officers landed on British soil. I need to look at that matter.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is absolutely right about the drafting of the amendment. It is purely my fault. I drafted this before Christmas and never managed to change it. I left it merely as a device to stimulate debate in Committee.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para7"></a>I was interested when the Minister said that the Government may wish to add further conditions after this provision has operated for a while. I can well understand the need for flexibility on the matter. Of course one wants to be able to add extra conditions if matters are working badly. My worry is that in the mean time we are guinea pigs in a system that may not be the right one and may be open to abuse. We need to consider that further between now and Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   I have probably missed something. The Minister said that he did not want the <P>


<a name="column_GC215"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment because the Government might want to strengthen the conditions. Is the noble Baroness satisfied that, bearing in mind what the Minister said,they could also weaken the conditions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, raises a vital point. One needs to ask the Government that question or the Minister may be prepared to give the assurance that they would not weaken conditions today. Perhaps I may both assist and harm the Government's case by saying that I can envisage circumstances where the Government might put forward alterations which they maintain would toughen up the conditions but which might unintentionally end up weakening them.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para8"></a>I do not know whether the Minster wishes to reply at this stage, or whether he would like to leave the matter until Report. It looks as though he is going to leave it until then. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br>
(a) entering a private home or any other place not accessible to the public, and
<br>
(b) challenging or arresting a person under surveillance."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30129-25_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 143 stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. At this stage we feel that it is essential that there should be clarity on the face of the Bill. We return to more of the mandatory provisions of the Schengen convention that are not on the face of the Bill. In this case it is Article 40.3(e), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The surveillance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be carried out only under the following general conditions:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-25_para12"></a> (e) Entry into private homes and places not accessible to the public shall be prohibited".
In paragraph 156 of the Explanatory Notes the Government say&#151;and the Minister in his general introduction to Clause 83 repeated and expanded on this matter&#151;that they will make an order under the powers given in new Section 76A(4) incorporating these conditions into the requirements to be followed by foreign officers.
<P>

<a name="30129-25_para13"></a>The Minister earlier appeared to be saying that these prohibitions would be subject to statute. We are saying, "Here is the statute. This is the right place to put it and at the moment we cannot see a good reason why these prohibitions should not be inserted on the face of the Bill". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I warmly support this very important amendment. Even our own police are not always free to enter a person's private house without having prior authority. The Government should regard this matter with great sympathy. There is one very minor drafting <P>


<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment that I would suggest. At the end of paragraph (a) instead of "and" the word should be "or".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Once again we strongly support the amendment. We support this amendment more than any other in the group. It prevents the exercise of a power that would enable officers carrying out hot surveillance to enter people's houses or to arrest people. Clearly, in no circumstances should they do so. We think that the case is very strong for putting this matter on the face of the Bill. This amendment directly affects individual people. It does not merely regulate the communications between the officers carrying out the surveillance and the authorities in this country; it directly restricts the powers of those carrying out surveillance to do certain things that would impinge directly on the lives of ordinary people. It is spelled out in black and white in the convention and we think the case therefore is overwhelming for putting this issue on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. This is a vital amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, will correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand the situation, a police officer in Vermont who pursues a suspect over the border into New Hampshire has no powers of arrest in New Hampshire. Therefore, why should someone coming from France have a power of arrest in the United Kingdom?

<P>

<A NAME="30129-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   There is always one fly in the unanimity ointment. On this occasion, and not for the first time, it will be me.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para0"></a>In essence, there is not much distance between our positions. We are all clear that, in the limited circumstances of foreign officers coming here, they will be prohibited from entering a private home. We intend to prohibit any such action by using the powers in 76A(4) through the affirmative resolution procedure. That is a clear statement of policy commitment by the Government. The matter will come before the House to ensure that it is adequately complied with.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para1"></a>Nothing in the Schengen arrangements makes it possible to challenge or arrest a person under surveillance. Rather, the Schengen handbook makes clear that foreign officers in those circumstances do not have powers of arrest and should not seek either to arrest or to approach a suspect. Therefore, we have no intention to give foreign officers any powers of arrest. <P>


<a name="column_GC217"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="30129-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Naturally, I am very disappointed by the Minister's response. I thank him for his explanation of the Government's approach. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Renton for his comment on drafting. I always take everything that he says on drafting to heart. I will come back with something better next time&#151;because there will be a next time. I am grateful for the support of the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart, Lord Monson, Lord Stoddart and Lord Carlisle.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para2"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, there is an overwhelming case for putting these matters in the Bill. I started by saying that there were questions of quid pro quo. What price do we pay for this yielding of our own rights? It would be a price too far. The Minister says that there is no problem and that we have given a commitment to make the provision by order. It is not appropriate to do so by order. We know about it; the Government have given a clear commitment; it is straightforward; it is right to do it; and so it should be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para3"></a>If we were not in Grand Committee, I would not withdraw my amendment. But I follow the Committee rules. Notwithstanding my protests that I feel I am doing the wrong thing simply because of procedure, I must beg leave to withdraw this amendment.

<P>

<a name="30129-26_para7"></a>Amendment No. 144 refers to the conditions that will be laid down by the Secretary of State for the operation of "hot surveillance", as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, so rightly called it. Are they the only conditions in the Schengen convention? If so, why not put them on the face of the Bill? The Explanatory Notes do not tell us whether additional conditions beyond those in the convention are being considered. Earlier, in response to other amendments, the Minister said that the Government want flexibility so that if tougher conditions need to be imposed, they may be. But, at this stage, we need to know whether any discussions are going ahead within the remit of these amendments. Are the Government aware that additional conditions might ultimately be imposed?
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para8"></a> Amendments Nos. 145 and 147 cover the instance where surveillance is to be "lawful for all purposes" if it complies with the conditions to be laid down in secondary legislation. Can, and will, those conditions allow types of surveillance that would not normally be <P>


<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allowed under UK law? Other noble Lords have said in respect of other amendments that it would be improper to give powers to foreign officers and Customs officers that are not available to our own police enforcement agencies and Customs officers.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para9"></a>Amendment No. 146 reflects my concern about whether, under this Bill, the conduct of a foreign police officer can be always lawful. The Bill implies that they can never do anything unlawful. That is extraordinary; it cannot be the case. There must be occasions when foreign officers' actions would be unlawful. For example, what would be a police officer's position if he committed a criminal offence in the course of surveillance? Earlier, the Minister said an officer who carried a gun in this country would be arrested. I assume that some actions would be considered unlawful. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The amendments all appear to deal with what would constitute lawful surveillance under the provisions, which is clearly important. I hope to be able to clarify the position.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para10"></a>The purpose of inserting new Section 76A(5) into RIPA is to make lawful the act of cross-border surveillance, both in ECHR terms and under UK law. That type of surveillance would not contravene those fundamental rights. As the Committee will be aware, surveillance in the UK is strictly governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which, therefore, we need to amend to make this type of surveillance lawful, until UK officers either take it over or instruct foreign officers to cease doing so. The clause applies only to types of surveillance that could otherwise be authorised under RIPA. That is affected by the definition of "relevant surveillance" in Section 76A(2). Legality prevails only in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para11"></a>The aim of Amendment No. 147 seems to be a desire for the lawfulness of the surveillance to be conditional on similar surveillance being lawful if undertaken in the UK. However, Schengen requires that, provided that the surveillance is lawful abroad, it should be automatically lawful in the UK, so long as it fulfils the conditions specified in Article 40.2, which I shall deal with. The amendment is inconsistent, therefore, with the concept of automatic authorisation subject to the conditions.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para12"></a>The provisions will not allow foreign officers to conduct themselves in a way that would be unlawful for UK officers. As I have explained, surveillance will be automatically authorised only in limited circumstances. First, it must be lawful in the country of origin, and foreign officers will be obliged to contact UK police as soon as the border has been crossed. Secondly, the type of urgent surveillance may be carried out only if the person under surveillance is suspected of having committed one or more of a limited number of serious extraditable offences, which I referred to earlier. They will be on the record. Thirdly, cross-border surveillance under the Bill will be subject to strict conditions reflecting the wording of the Schengen convention. The conditions include that foreign police and Customs officers conducting this type of surveillance must not enter private homes and <P>


<a name="column_GC219"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may not challenge or arrest suspects. As I have noted in our discussions on earlier amendments, we are making that provision through an order-making power subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para13"></a>I shall respond to some specific questions. No extra conditions are contemplated. But, as with any such arrangement, it shall be kept under review to see whether it works in practice and is adequate. On the question of whether all an officer's actions must be lawful, paragraph 40.3(a) of the Schengen convention requires the officer to comply with the law of the contracting party in whose territory they are operating. There is no resiling from that in any respect. For those reasons, and although we sympathise with the thrust of the amendment, legality is tightly challenged on a supervising officer, and it is necessary to draft the legislation in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for addressing my immediate questions. I will look carefully at the response. He will be aware from my comments at Second Reading that I get uneasy when we give permission for foreign officers and Customs officers to carry out surveillance here that would be lawful in their own countries but unlawful if carried out by our own officers. There may be some misunderstanding on my part, given the reactions expressed in the Chamber previously. I shall look carefully at the matter between Committee and Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para14"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="30129-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 148:

"(4B) Nothing in this section shall render lawful the carrying of a firearm within the United Kingdom by a foreign police or customs officer."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30129-26_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: With the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 149. The amendments are tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia also.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para18"></a>These amendments relate to the carrying of guns, to which we referred in the opening statement on Clause 83. They relate to the carrying of guns by foreign officers who are undertaking "hot surveillance" operations. As the Committee will have perceived on reading the two amendments, they are alternatives. Amendment No. 148 would prohibit the carrying of a gun by a foreign officer on UK soil. Amendment No. 149 would allow the Secretary of State acting personally, or a chief officer of police acting personally, to give authorisation for the carrying of firearms on "hot surveillance" operations. That could be given only in circumstances in which such authorisation would be given to a UK police officer.
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para19"></a>New subsection (4E) replicates with a slight amendment&#151;inserting "reasonably" instead of "legitimate"&#151;Article 40(3)(e) of the Schengen Convention, which is yet another provision that is not on the face of the Bill. Given that that article of Schengen states that officers can carry their guns <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>except when specifically denied permission, does that mean that Parliament cannot pass Amendment No. 149, which would put in place the reverse situation? It would provide that officers cannot carry guns except when specifically granted permission. Will the noble Lord confirm the situation?
<P>

<a name="30129-26_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, earlier raised pertinent questions about the carrying of guns in this country. What happens if someone engaged in hot pursuit, properly, is part of an undercover team? I can see circumstances in which I would wish to argue against the surrender of handguns on entering the country. We need to discuss and resolve the issue between now and Report. I do not want a police officer carrying out a proper undercover surveillance operation to be put in a life-threatening situation whereby legislation requires them to publicly lodge their police-registered firearm before coming here to carry out surveillance in England. There must be a way of preventing them from carrying firearms into this country in the first instance, and then using them, without jeopardising their undercover operations and their lives. The Bill as drafted at present does not properly protect the public in this country. We must also protect police and Customs officers who may be carrying out a very dangerous assignment. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We strongly support the principle behind the amendment; namely that foreign officers carrying out surveillance in this country should not carry arms with them. Equally, there is force in the problem mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that the requirement on foreign officers to dispose of a weapon they carried lawfully in the country they left may destroy the possibility of surveillance or put their lives at risk.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para0"></a>I want to raise another point, which the Minister may not be able to answer immediately. Would a blanket prohibition on the carrying of weapons by foreign surveillance officers be compatible with the terms of the 1990 convention? Paragraph 3(d) of Article 40 of the convention says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The officers carrying out the surveillance may carry their service weapons during the surveillance save where specifically otherwise decided by the requested Party".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-27_para1"></a>
That indicates that there is a general right to carry firearms but that, when the application is made under paragraph 1&#151;an advance request for authorisation&#151;or paragraph 2&#151;an urgent request&#151;the requested party may, case by case, say, "No. We will only give you authority provided you do not bring arms with you". I find it difficult to see how a contracting party such as the United Kingdom can say in advance that in no circumstances can anybody carry service weapons, even before a request has been made and considered. That is, arguably, inconsistent with paragraph 3(d).
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para2"></a>I appreciate that it may be a difficult legal point. There may be a short answer, or it may need further consideration. I would be interested to know the answer.

<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns said that Amendments Nos. 148 and 149 were alternatives. Amendment No. 149 is the more attractive alternative, not only because of what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said about whether there was a power to give a blanket refusal to allow arms to be carried.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para3"></a>We must be realistic about the degree of violence that occurs today involving not only terrorists but drugs gangs. Someone from another country who is carrying out surveillance in this country for a short time may put his life at risk, if he continues that surveillance without being armed. He will have had permission to be armed in the country from which he comes, and, with the amendment, he could apply for permission to maintain possession of those arms in particular circumstances. There should be some provision for that, if we are to deal with the wider use of firearms against the police.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   I tend to favour Amendment No. 148, which would prohibit the carrying of firearms in any circumstances, although I understand the reasons behind the following amendment. The reasons why I favour Amendment No. 148 go back to the question of whether we are talking about hot pursuit or surveillance. If it is merely surveillance, there is unlikely to be contact with the criminal. In those circumstances, I cannot see the point of carrying firearms.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para4"></a>I know that that is an arguable point&#151;how close is the surveillance? However, bearing in mind that British police are permitted to carry firearms only in unusual and dangerous circumstances&#151;even then, it will be done only by highly trained people&#151;it would be wrong to allow foreign policemen to carry firearms under less stringent conditions. We must consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   It would be helpful for the Committee to know how often United Kingdom customs officers, as distinct from police officers, carry firearms. I have never heard of them doing so, but I may be mistaken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   It has been an interesting and important debate and has taken a slightly different turn from what we might have expected.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para5"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 148, I must say that we already have laws that prohibit such activity, so there is no need for any further legislation to prevent foreign officers from bringing firearms in. I appreciated the thoughtful way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, raised the issue behind Amendment No. 149. She got us to think about the risks in such situations and reflect on the safety of the foreign officer and of our public.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para6"></a>The noble Baroness was right to raise such considerations. The sort of surveillance operations that we are discussing will involve people suspected of serious criminal offences. Frequently, they will be serious, professional criminals, and, frequently, they will be armed. That is the unfortunate reality of life. However, I am, at this point, less persuaded that that <P>


<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>means that there should be the sort of discretion envisaged in Amendment No. 149. There are several reasons for that. Partly, it is because we take our stance in principle alongside the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, which may surprise him. It seemed right to us that we should have a clear-cut situation. In addition, if the UK considers that there is a high level of risk with someone coming in who is known to be armed, that person can be arrested on arrival at the entry port.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para7"></a>If the surveillance officer is a foreign police officer, he will, in most situations, be in his car tailing another car, until such times as UK undercover cars can pick up the surveillance. The foreign officer would not be seeking to get close to or arrest the person, so, although I will not say that there would be no risk, it would not be a situation of challenge in which the officer is trying to arrest the person or corner him. There is some risk with anyone who carries a gun, but there is less risk in the circumstances that we are discussing. Finally, UK officers will take over the surveillance immediately, in most cases, or within a maximum of five hours or not at all. They will often&#151;if not always&#151;have guns in their car for high-risk situations of the type that we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para8"></a>For those reasons, it is not necessary explicitly to prohibit foreign officers from carrying firearms. Current legislation already does that. We are not persuaded that the level of risk that the noble Baroness properly referred to is such as to justify the making of Amendment No. 149.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para9"></a>I cannot tell the noble Lord, Lord Monson, how frequently UK police officers carry arms. It is certainly done more frequently than it used to be, which is of concern to us all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I asked about customs officers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am sorry. I shall write to the noble Lord with as open an answer as I can give in the circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Has not the Minister, in a way, contradicted his own argument? If the British police officers or customs officers who will take over the surveillance are armed or have the authority to be armed because the risks are so great, it seems hard that the officers carrying out the surveillance in another country cannot be armed on the same basis. The risk to them is as great.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para10"></a>The Minister implied that surveillance officers would usually be armed in serious cases such as those that we are considering. It would be reasonable in such cases to have a means whereby&#151;with permission, in particular cases and for a short period&#151;the officer from another country could have the same protection as we provide for our own police force.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The situations are not parallel or identical. Foreign police officers coming in in the limited circumstances that we are describing have only a surveillance role; they have no powers of apprehension, arrest or challenge. They are seeking to have undercover, covered surveillance, without <P>


<a name="column_GC223"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>making their presence apparent to the person being tailed. I should not stray into operational matters, but I expect that there would be situations in which undercover UK police officers taking over the surveillance would have guns in their car. However, that is a different situation. If the person being tailed did anything that British police officers thought infringed UK laws or posed a risk to citizens, those officers would have a power of apprehension or arrest. The two situations are not the same.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para11"></a>It is perfectly right that UK police officers should have such powers in such circumstances. I see less need&#151;if any&#151;for a foreign officer in a surveillance-only role to have them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The Minister has not answered my question about whether a general prohibition on carrying weapons was compatible with the Schengen Convention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am sorry. I had the answer, and, in the shuffling of papers, I overlooked it.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para12"></a>A nation's decisions on the application of Schengen need not be made case by case. It will be permissible for the UK to prohibit the carrying of service weapons in general, rather than make case-by-case judgments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Is that answer based on our interpretation of Article 40, or is there something specific somewhere other than Article 40 that makes it clear that we have that power?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   At this point, I shall take the noble Lord's invitation to stop and write to him. That would be the most appropriate way of dealing with that further question about the basis of our judgment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-27_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who took part in that short debate on this vital matter. I am sure that we will return to it on Report. I heard what my noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow said about the preferability of Amendment No. 149 and what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said about the preferability of Amendment No. 148. We need to resolve some difficult issues before I decide which amendments to bring back and how to draft them.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised a crucial issue. The provisions of the clause affect the role and powers not only of police officers but of customs officers. In reports on the Bill&#151;such as they were&#151;when it was published, I noticed that there was little realisation in the public domain, in the press or on TV that the powers would go to customs officers as well as police officers. That realisation is also not yet established among our colleagues in the House who have not had the advantage of taking part in the Committee stage. There ought to be a broader debate on the role of customs officers. I was pleased that the noble Lord highlighted that issue.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para14"></a>I am, as ever, grateful to the Minister for his response, but there are issues that I must consider carefully, to ensure that firearms are not carried inappropriately, although there may be occasions on <P>


<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which safety means that they should be carried. That is a dilemma that I must resolve in my amendments, before I try to persuade the Government that they are needed.
<P>

<a name="30129-27_para15"></a>The Minister said that surveillance does not involve challenge. The reality of surveillance is that things can go horribly wrong in these groups. One can be betrayed. An undercover officer who is challenged may be uncovered. In those circumstances, for the sake of his life, he may want to use the firearm in his possession. We need to take such circumstances into account and consider how properly to deal with them. At this stage, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 55, leave out lines 33 to 35.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-28_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30129-28_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 150, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 151, both of which are in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. Both amendments address the issue of exemption from civil liability which is afforded under the proposed new Section 76A(5). Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An officer is not to be subject to any civil liability in respect of any conduct of his which is incidental"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-28_para2"></a>
incidental is the crucial word&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to any surveillance that is lawful by virtue of subsection (4)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30129-28_para3"></a><P>

<a name="30129-28_para4"></a>I have difficulties with the use of the word "incidental" and with how it is defined. The word seems to be applied almost casually. I have therefore knocked out the word and said that the action should be "a necessary element of" the surveillance. Without the change, citizens of this country would not have protection from activities that result from the officer's carelessness rather than from the surveillance. The officer could, for example, come from France and not be particularly accustomed to driving on the left-hand side of the road. He might drive on the right-hand side of the road and knock someone down. Would the injured person therefore have no redress? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   This simply cannot be right, can it? As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, a police or customs officer could come over here, drive on the wrong side of the road and kill someone, but not bear any civil liability. That simply cannot be right. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, to assure us that, if that happens, even if the individual officer has no civil liability, it will be possible for someone who <P>


<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<B>29 Jan 2003 : Column GC225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has harm caused to his person or property to sue the Government or another authority so that he can be compensated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   If it does mean what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, says, surely the provision gives to the officer coming from abroad far more immunity from civil liability than would apply to an officer in this country. There is the well-known case&#151;the name escapes me for the moment, but I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will remember it; I think that it is Ince&#151;in which an officer knocked over someone at a crossroad when going to answer a 999 emergency call. The case gave rise to a claim for damages and had a lot to do with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. I cannot see why we should enable officers from abroad to avoid liability where their activity, although incidental to a surveillance, is nevertheless negligent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It may help the Committee if I explain why we need these provisions and this particular wording.
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para5"></a>For UK officers carrying out surveillance, the most obvious example of incidental conduct is trespass. For example, an undercover officer might follow the suspect into a shopping centre or supermarket. As the officer would have no intention of doing any shopping, he might be committing trespass.
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para6"></a>Currently, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act would give him or her protection from any civil trespass claim that might arise. Consistent with RIPA in wording and spirit, new Section 76A has two elements: the authorised conduct&#151;the actual carrying out of the surveillance&#151;is made lawful for all purposes; and officers are protected from civil liability for any incidental conduct&#151;hence the phraseology&#151;by virtue of subsection (5), the subject of this amendment.
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para7"></a>Subsection (5) is designed to give foreign officers authorised under new Section 76A the same protection from, say, trespass in shopping centres as I have described.
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para8"></a>I should stress that the order to be made under new Section 76A(4) will provide that foreign officers conducting surveillance under new Section 76A should not enter private homes and places not accessible to the public. So incidental trespass should arise only in very limited circumstances. But it is a possibility, which is why we need to make provision for it. There may also be other cases where foreign officers incur civil liability for conduct incidental to their lawful surveillance.
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para9"></a>As we have said before, the key to Schengen cross-border surveillance arrangements is reciprocity. We need to provide foreign officers with the same protection as that afforded to UK officers undertaking domestic surveillance. Article 40.3 of the Schengen convention sets out arrangements on civil liabilities, so we can expect reciprocal arrangements for our officers operating abroad in broadly similar circumstances.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129-28_para10"></a>As for vehicles, we consider that "incidental" will not include negligent or reckless conduct by foreign officers who are conducting surveillance. "Incidental" means acts that are required by the surveillance. We do not consider that it would prevent claims for injuries caused by car accidents involving foreign officers operating here. So there is redress in those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Does the Minister agree that nothing he has said detracts from the merits of Amendment No. 151? The alleged trespass of officers going into a supermarket would be "a necessary element of" their entering the supermarket. Amendment No. 151 tightens up the provision and provides extra safeguards. I see no reason for the Government resisting that particular amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I have set out the position as we see it, and it is important to understand why we have used that particular wording. I think that my comments in response to the specific point and example given by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, make it clear that there would be redress. Those circumstances are covered by Clause 85. I think that I have answered the point. However, the point does not necessarily relate to this clause and the way in which it is worded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   In order that we can get it on record, the Minister has said that there will be redress, but redress against whom or against which authority? That is the important thing. Where do people go for redress?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The answer to that is: the Director-General of NCIS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129-28_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   That was helpful; I think that there is a brief reference to it in the Explanatory Notes, but it is very helpful to have it on the record. I shall look carefully at the helpful response from the Minister. However, I still have concerns about use of the word "incidental" when it is saying that any conduct which is incidental to the surveillance may let someone escape liability. The Minister was trying to be helpful by saying that negligent or reckless conduct would not receive the exemption. There could, of course, be lower tests than "negligent" or "reckless" that could still cause damage. I think that we need to consider that. However, it is a complex matter. At this stage of the evening, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30129w01_sbhd0"></a><H4><center>Inland Revenue: Security Holdings</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 16 January (WA 52&#150;53), what are the estimated current market value and income yield of the Inland Revenue's security holdings listed on pages 32 and 33 of the statement supplementing the Consolidated Fund and National Loans Fund accounts.[HL1217]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  Some securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange but others are not quoted. Many of the securities holdings are bonds which are redeemable from specified dates. It is not possible therefore to give the information requested.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 16 January (WA 52&#150;53), why reasons of taxpayer confidentiality prevent them from answering the last part of Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay's Question (HL1016) on what plans they have for these holdings.[HL1218]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  It is not appropriate to release information about specific holdings of securities as that would reveal confidential information supplied by taxpayers. Exemption 15 (Statutory and other restrictions) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information applies. Securities are generally held against payment of a tax debt and are returned to the taxpayer when the debt is paid. If the debt is not paid the Inland Revenue can dispose of the assets.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 16 January (WA 52&#150;53), what are the arrangements for management of the Inland Revenue's security holdings described in Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay's Question (HL1016); and what performance targets are applicable.[HL1219]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  Securities are held by the Inland Revenue against payment of a tax debt and are returned to the taxpayer when the debt is paid. If the debt is not paid the Inland Revenue seeks specialist advice on disposal of the assets.

<A NAME="30129w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will explain the different circumstances under which it is possible for the Inland Revenue to acquire security holdings.[HL1220]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  In certain circumstances securities may occasionally be accepted as security for a tax debt&#151;perhaps because the taxpayer is unable to offer other assets as security instead. The Inland Revenue also accepts securities where tax due from overseas cannot be released directly to the UK because of exchange controls. Other securities can be issued by debtor companies under statutory provision.

<a name="30129w01_sbhd1"></a><H4><center>Human Rights Act 1998 Guidance</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will amend the guidance given to government departments by the Cabinet Office on the Human Rights Act 1998 in February 2000 to include and be consistent with the guidance subsequently given by the Lord Chancellor to departments about Explanatory Notes on Bills, indicating that they should identify the main ways in which convention rights are thought to be engaged and explaining why the department considers measures in a Bill to be compatible with convention rights.[HL1045]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  Yes, my department is presently undertaking a comprehensive revision of Human Rights Act 1998: Guidance for Departments which was issued by the Cabinet Office in February 2000. The new edition will take account of all significant developments. It will include the amended guidance relating to explanatory notes on Bills.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para0"></a>This amended guidance states that explanatory notes on Bills should describe the most significant convention issues thought to arise on a Bill, together with the Minister's conclusions on compatibility; amended guidance draws attention to the fact that the explanatory notes are published by Parliament and should thus be neutral in tone.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para1"></a>In the meantime, the amended guidance about explanatory notes on Bills has been made available by my department through LION (Legal Information Online Network), the website for Government lawyers, and is also available on the Human Rights Unit's website. In addition, we have reminded officials about the amended guidance, using the network of nominated departmental human rights contacts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many offenders have been sent to prison for persistent burglary under the automatic three-year sentence since the relevant legislation entered into effect in December 1999.[HL946]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  Information reported to the Home Office shows that six persons were sentenced under Section 111 of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (previously Section 4 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997) in England and Wales for a third offence of burglary by the end of 2001.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para2"></a>An offender has to have committed an offence, been apprehended, prosecuted and convicted, on three separate occasions since 1 December 1999 to be subject to the mandatory sentence. Given that a custodial sentence for the first or second offence since December 1999 is likely in many cases it will take some time before significant numbers of offenders who qualify for the mandatory sentence appear before the courts.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para3"></a>Information for 2002 is due for publication in the late autumn of 2003.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para4"></a>These provisions do not extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<a name="30129w01_sbhd3"></a><H4><center>Cyprus</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Moynihan  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What practical support they are offering to help bring about a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem by 28 February on the basis of the United Nations Secretary-General's proposals.[HL1087]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  The UK continues to give full support to the UN efforts to secure, by 28 February, a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's revised proposals of 10 December. This would allow both sides of the island to hold referenda in time for a reunited Cyprus to sign the Treaty of Accession with the European Union on 16 April. Our preference remains for a reunited Cyprus to accede to the EU, which would be in the best interests of all Cypriots, of Greece and Turkey, of Europe and the region as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30129w01_para5"></a>We maintain a high level of political engagement with the UN-led process. For example, when my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary met Turkish Ministers at the Copenhagen European Council in December and when my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence visited Ankara on 8 January. The UK Special Representative for Cyprus, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, will visit Athens, Ankara and Nicosia in the next two weeks in order to help facilitate negotiations.

<P>
<UL>What reply they received to the letter dated 16 November 2002 by the Minister of Europe to Commissioner de Palacio; and whether they will place a copy in the Library of the House.[HL1089]<P></UL>

<A NAME="30129w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </B>  Commissioner de Palacio responded to the letter of my honourable friend the Minister for Europe on 20 November 2002. The reply referred to previous correspondence between the UK's Permanent Representative to the EU and the Commission (copies of which have already been placed in the Libraries of the House).

<P>
<UL>Whether they will discuss with the Government of Russia an extension for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's mandate to monitor human rights abuses by all parties in and arising from Chechnya.[HL1136]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </B>  My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary raised this issue with the Russian Foreign Minister in late December, seeking an extension to the OSCE Assistance Group's mandate, including its responsibilities to monitor the human rights and humanitarian situation in Chechnya. The UK have also supported sustained EU pressure to agree a mandate for the assistance group that would be acceptable both to Russia and other members of the OSCE. We are disappointed that, thus far, it has not been possible to achieve this.

<A NAME="30129w01_wqn9"></A><B> Baroness Ramsey of Cartvale  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What is their position on Iraq following the presentation of the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Committee's (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) updates 60 days after the resumption of weapons inspections.[HL1361]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </B>  I have today placed in the Library copies of the statement made to the United Nations Security Council on 27 January by Dr Blix of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and Dr El Baradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Taken together, these statements are damning and disturbing. They show beyond doubt that the Iraqi regime is responding to Resolution 1441 not with active co-operation but with a consistent pattern of concealment and deceit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w02_wqn0"></A><B> Earl Attlee  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What were the causes and circumstances of a Challenger main battle tank falling off the Oshkosh heavy equipment transporter the day before it was to be demonstrated to the public; and[HL1078]
<P>
Who will pay for the cost of inspecting and repairing any damage to the main battle tank which fell off the Oshkosh heavy equipment transporter; and what is the replacement value; and[HL1079]
<P>
What assurances they can give that heavy armoured vehicles will not fall off Oshkosh heavy equipment transporters or cause them to roll over when on public roads when in general service.[HL1080]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  The heavy equipment transporter service is provided by a consortium led by Halliburton KBR. The design, build and supply of the vehicle are undertaken by the Oshkosh Truck Corporation under sub-contract to Fasttrax Ltd. The supply and management of the trailers is undertaken by King Trailers of Market Harborough under sub-contract to Oshkosh.
<P>

<a name="30129w02_para0"></a>The incident occurred on 2 December 2002 at Tidworth Garrison during preparations for a demonstration of the heavy equipment transporter. Investigations into the incident are in progress. Liability for the cost of inspection and repair to the Challenger 2 main battle tank will be determined following completion of the investigations, which are focusing on the operating procedures followed at the time, the interface between load and trailer and the characteristics of the trailer. This investigation will also identify what action is needed to reduce the risk of any further incidents of this nature. I will write to the noble Earl once the investigations have reached a conclusion.
<P>

<a name="30129w02_para1"></a>The Challenger 2 main battle tank is no longer in production. The unit production cost of the tanks purchased against the most recent contract from the Ministry of Defence was &#163;5.7 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  Given the integrated nature of the public private partnership (PPP) we have not separately costed individual workstreams within the project. However, we expect the total cost, since the PPP was announced in the Strategic Defence Review, to be around &#163;80 million. This includes not only the splitting of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and QinetiQ but also the initial options study, the public consultation process, vesting of QinetiQ as a plc and completion of the sale of shares in the company. Of this, approximately &#163;24 million relates to expenditure on IT and infrastructure and approximately &#163;49 million relates to consultancy fees.

<P>
<A NAME="30129w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  Figures for Gulf veterans' mortality from 1 April 1991 to 30 June 2002 were published on 24 July 2002 (WA 81&#150;82) in answer to a Question by my noble friend Lord Elder. The latest data, as at 31 December 2002, are shown in Table 1 below. As before, the data for Gulf veterans are compared to those of a control group, known as the Era cohort, which is made up of Armed Forces personnel of a similar age, gender, service and rank who were not deployed. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of deaths from cancer (malignant neoplasm) by anatomical site.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What time must elapse before (a) the holder of a valid British passport arriving in this country without means, and (b) an asylum seeker arriving in this country destitute, becomes entitled to accommodation and social security benefits. [HL1026]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  There is no set time-scale within which British passport holders arriving in the UK who are not habitually resident in the common travel area (the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man) become eligible for income-related benefits or social housing. However, if they apply for either they are subject to the habitual residence test. If they pass the test they can receive help through the benefit system and apply for social housing immediately. If they fail the test they may appeal against the decision or re-apply at a later date.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para0"></a>Under the National Assistance Act 1948, local authorities may provide accommodation to British passport holders who do not pass the habitual residence test if they are destitute and have a need for care and attention which is not otherwise available. Such accommodition can only be provided as board and lodging and if the local authority considers it appropriate to do so in all the circumstances. Authorities are not obliged under the Act to provide other services or cash payments.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para1"></a>Under the Children Act 1989 local authority social services departments are responsible for supporting any children in need, regardless of their country of origin. A returning child with a UK passport would receive help from social services in the same way as any other child. Services are provided to protect the welfare of the child but can be provided to other family members if to do so would meet this primary aim. Support under the Act is also available to unaccompanied children seeking asylum.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para2"></a>Since 3 April 2000, the Home Office, through the National Asylum Support Service, has been responsible for supporting and accommodating asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their asylum application.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will undertake an economic analysis of the investment required to ensure that government programmes aimed at lifting children out of poverty reach disabled children.[HL1030]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham:  </B>  Research suggests that children in workless households are much more likely to be deprived than children living in a working household. Work is crucial if we are to stop life-cycle effects of poverty and the way it is passed down the generations. Work is not only important for those of working age. Children who grow up in non-working families have an increased risk of being unemployed themselves in adulthood. This is borne out by Gregg and Machin in their 1998 paper: Child Development and Success or Failure in the Youth Labour Market, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para3"></a>However, we recognise that disabled children and their families have additional needs. We are committed to helping severely disabled people with the extra costs they face as a result of their disabilities. This is why from April 2001 the disabled living allowance higher rate mobility component was extended to severely disabled children aged three and four, providing extra help to their families currently worth &#163;39.30 a week.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para4"></a>A full analysis of our strategy to eradicate child poverty is given in our annual Opportunity for all reports. Opportunity for all&#151;fourth annual report
(Cm 5598) was published in September 2002. It reports on a range of outcome indicators covering many dimensions of poverty and social exclusion.

<P>
<UL>What negotiations have been held since 1947 with countries with which the United Kingdom still does not have a reciprocal social security agreement; what plans they have to conduct any such negotiations; and whether the governments of any of the affected countries have expressed a wish to conduct negotiations.[HL1055]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham:  </B>  Since 6 July 1948, when the national insurance scheme began, 33 agreements have been implemented over time following negotiations with the governments of 34 other countries or territories on possible reciprocal agreements covering social security benefits.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para5"></a>No commitments have been made to enter into new agreements with other countries for over 20 years. A new agreement with Barbados came into force in April 1992 but that fulfilled a commitment given to
the Government of Barbados in the 1970s. The Government's policy is not actively to seek to enter into new reciprocal social security agreements with other countries that would extend payment of UK benefits to persons abroad.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para6"></a>As far as is known, the UK has received no formal requests from other governments with a view to entering into negotiations on possible reciprocal agreements covering social security benefits.

<P>
<UL>What is the estimated annual cost of paying the winter fuel payment to British pensioners who do not live in the United Kingdom; and how many will benefit in 2003&#150;04.[HL1056]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham:  </B>  People who are entitled to a winter fuel payment while living in the UK may be able to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they move to another European economic area (EEA) country. Our broad estimate for 2003&#150;04 is that some 69,000 people could be so entitled at a cost of up to
&#163;11 million. This estimate will be revised when we have sufficient data on actual payments made to entitled recipients living in another EEA country.

<UL>Following Greenland's departure from the European Economic Community because of the common fisheries policy, how Greenland's fish stocks now compare to those of the United Kingdom and the European Union.[HL1066]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Scientific assessment reports indicate that most of the largest stocks in the vicinity of Greenland have been at low levels during the most recent decade and that the cod stock off Greenland is in a severely depleted state. The shrimp stocks are at a high level, however, possibly because of the absence of predation by cod.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Recent Defra research showed that during the past 30 years house sparrow populations have declined most in South East England and suburban and urban gardens have seen the most marked fall. In contrast, they are thriving in Scotland and Wales, both in urban and rural areas.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para7"></a>Starling numbers have declined in both suburban and rural areas. The decline has been greatest in the South and West. Starling breeding patterns have shown a recent improvement but this is least so in urban gardens in the South East.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para8"></a>Defra research has been complemented by work co-ordinated on behalf of the London Biodiversity Partnership (LBP) by the RSPB, London Wildlife Trust, Greater London Authority and London Natural History Society. The survey Where Have All Our Sparrows Gone? ran from 18 June until 19 July 2002. The Mayor of London announced the results of the research on 14 January.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para9"></a>Over 9,000 people took part in the survey, counting almost 75,000 sparrows and creating the most detailed picture of the city's sparrows to date. The broad picture is of a ring of urban London where sparrows are still quite common, rather fewer sparrows around the outskirts, a definite sparrow hotspot on the eastern side of London but a gap in Inner London where very few sparrows were recorded. The lowest mean number of sparrows was found in the Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster areas.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para10"></a>Other interesting results include that sparrows were more likely to nest in homes built before 1945 than in newer homes. City farms have continued to attract sparrows, even within the inner boroughs: 96 per cent had sparrows, with an average count of 12 birds.
<P>

<a name="30129w03_para11"></a>Further analysis of the survey results is planned to see how strongly they correlate with various factors in London that might be impacting on sparrows.

<A NAME="30129w03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Environment Agency is not under any duty to maintain and clean arterial watercourses. Primary responsibility for the maintenance of all watercourses rests with the riparian owners.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

They are widespread throughout the UK and eradication is not considered a reasonable prospect for the country as a whole. However, some locations in the UK provide special circumstances where eradication may be feasible, for example, the Hebrides where the Scottish authorities are undertaking a project which aims to achieve local mink eradication.

<A NAME="30129w04_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the estimate of the cost to industry of complying with future legislation arising from (a) the European Union chemicals strategy and (b) the new detergents directive.[HL1171]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30129w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   (a) The estimated costs to industry of complying with the White Paper of February 2001 on a Strategy for a Future Chemicals Policy vary widely. For instance, the recent business impact assessment produced for the Commission estimated the direct cost to industry as ranging between E1.4 billion to E7 billion (&#163;886 million to &#163;4.43 billion) across the EU&#151;based on certain assumptions and scenarios.
<P>

<a name="30129w04_para9"></a>The partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) prepared by my department suggests that the costs to the UK industry alone might be of the order of &#163;423 million (about E670 million).
<P>

<a name="30129w04_para10"></a>A revised RIA will be required when proposals for the European Commission's legislation are available, and my department is working closely with other interested departments, the devolved administrations and concerned stakeholders to develop its scope and content. As well as considering the benefits and costs of the proposals in detail, the RIA will include an assessment of the implications of the proposed legislation for the international competitiveness of the UK chemicals industry and other manufacturing sectors that use chemicals in their processes and products.
<P>

<a name="30129w04_para11"></a>(b) Currently there is no reliable estimate for the cost of implementing the proposed detergents regulation. My department is in the process of completing an RIA for it and will ensure that, as part of this process, the views of industry and other consultees are taken into account. The RIA will generate the estimate called for and will be made publicly available.

<P>

<a name="30129w04_para15"></a>On 23 January it recommended a new allowance which will enable Members of the House of Lords to claim reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses for up to two return visits per annum on parliamentary business to European institutions in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg and to the national parliaments of EU member states or EU candidate countries.
<P>

<a name="30129w04_para16"></a>This allowance will be similar to that available to Members of the House of Commons following the Resolution of that House on 9 May 2002. As in the House of Commons, approval for any such visit will need to be sought from the House authorities in advance.
<P>

<a name="30129w04_para17"></a>I will table a motion for a Resolution of the House to authorise this new allowance in the next few weeks.

They are supported by Department for Transport staff in the Traffic Area Network (TAN). The position of traffic commissioners will be unchanged by the merger of TAN with the Vehicle Inspectorate staff to form the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA). TAN will be a separate division of VOSA. No representations have been received concerning the proposal.

<a name="30129w05_para0"></a>In some licensed centres a woman may be offered treatment involving in vitro fertilisation at reduced cost in return for sharing the eggs she produces with another woman receiving in vitro fertilisation. This arrangement can be advantageous to both women involved. It may allow one to receive treatment that she could not otherwise afford, while providing eggs for the other. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority considered egg sharing in 1998 and has kept it under review since then, covering the provision of consent and the preparation of formal agreements between the parties involved in its code of practice. The authority is aware, however, that some people find this a matter of concern and the issue is to be discussed by the authority's ethics committee. The conclusions of the committee, and of the authority as a whole, will be communicated to the House and placed in the Library.
