<h2 align=center><a name="date_0"></a>Wednesday, 26 April 2006.</h2>



<h4 align=center><a name="hd_0"></a>The House met at three of the clock: the LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</h4>

<a name="60426-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>United Nations: Charter</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Donoughue </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What progress is being made to reform the charter of the United Nations, especially with reference to any redesignations.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, the Government welcome the unanimous decision taken by UN member states at the 2005 world summit to delete references to &quot;enemy states&quot; from the UN charter. In practice, amendment of the charter on the specific point is unlikely in the near future until more substantive changes to the charter are agreed&#151;for example, on reform of the Security Council.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Donoughue: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that helpful reply to my not wholly transparent Question. Does she agree that today, more than 60 years after the end of World War II, having in three articles of the charter&#151;I think that they are Articles 53, 77 and 107&#151;statements about &quot;enemies&quot; and &quot;enemy states&quot; that clearly refer to Japan, Germany and Italy, among others, is not only anachronistic but positively offensive to our good friends? I am aware that the summit in 2005 and indeed the General Assembly a decade earlier voted to delete those statements. Will my noble friend report on any progress that has been made on that and promise the House that the Government will continue urgently to pursue these reforms?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right that the statements are anachronistic and could be deemed offensive, but the process of amending the charter is very long. Discussions began in 1975; we are now in 2006. Amending the charter would require the agreement of 128 member states. Of course, that is what we are working for, and we hope that we will get there in the end, but the important thing at the moment is that there has been recognition that such language is obsolete. My noble friend referred to Japan and Germany, but those two countries are not themselves pressing for an urgent resolution to what could be deemed to be a problem. However, it is a matter on which the UK will keep up pressure, and I undertake to inform the House as soon as there has been movement on the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, reform of the UN charter in the way suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, is obviously welcome, but does the Minister agree that it is not a vital part of the current <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_142"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reforms that are needed by the United Nations that the Secretary-General has been proposing with the support of others, such as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay?
</p>

<a name="60426-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The Minister mentioned Japan and the UN Security Council. A change that we want to see is the modernisation of the membership of the Security Council, and it is the Government&#039;s policy to back Japan&#039;s membership. That issue is being pushed rather weakly. When will we be a little more vigorous in making the obvious point that, as Japan, Germany and the United States pay half the budget of the United Nations, they should all be proper members of the inner board or Security Council?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, Her Majesty&#039;s Government have been pushing this very strongly. Indeed, we were one of the countries pushing it most strongly at the world summit last year. There was great momentum at that time, but at this stage I am sad to report that progress looks uncertain. However, the Government will not let go of it. We will keep pushing it because, as noble Lords know, we firmly support enlargement of the Security Council to include Germany, Japan, India and Brazil precisely because they are important global powers that deserve a seat on the council.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that progress was made at last year&#039;s summit and since then on issues such as establishing the Peacebuilding Commission and the new Human Rights Council and that that demonstrates that all concerned attach a higher priority to those substantive issues, including the countries that might want to be permanent members and those that might want to have their enemy status deleted? That is extremely welcome. Will she also confirm that the principal obstacle to Japan becoming a permanent member is China?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right that there is much focus at present on the practical issues and outcomes of the global summit last year, which is something that we should celebrate. It may be interesting for noble Lords to note that the Government intend shortly to lay before Parliament a Command Paper on the UN, which will include our assessment of the progress made on the implementation of the reforms agreed at the summit and on the outstanding issues to be addressed. I understand that China is one of the major obstacles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that the work of the high-level panel of which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was a distinguished member, plus the original Question, indicate that there is a serious need to continue pressure for reform of the United Nations? Could she find a way of perhaps bringing regular reports to the House, other than the special debates that may be set up by Back-Benchers, to keep us informed of events? We are a significant member, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_143"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and our voice needs to be heard in pressing for continuing reform. The present structure is not appropriate for the 21st century.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, we have supported reform of the UN for a long time, and I pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. We continue to press for reforms in the most practical way, having discussions within the UN and with our partners all the time, and we shall continue to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, we welcome the announcement that there will be a government report to Parliament. Britain is a member of two active caucuses in the United Nations&#151;the European Union and the Commonwealth. The European Union, with current applicants, represents more than 30 members of the United Nations, and the Commonwealth is well over 60. Can the report say how actively Britain is engaged in building coalitions for reform in the UN through those mechanisms?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, that is an eminently sensible idea that I shall certainly put to my colleagues in the Foreign Office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Cunningham of Felling: </b>   My Lords, first, I should place on record the fact that I have the honour to be the current chairman of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group. Will the Government redouble our efforts in support of Japan, given that we share so many wide-ranging and important interests with our great friends in Japan? The Government should make it clear not only to our colleagues in the United Nations who support the reforms but to the Chinese that we do not expect them to go on stalling this for ever.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, I assure noble Lords that we shall continue to press the matter with the utmost urgency.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Northbourne </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will review the law on parental responsibility with particular reference to the rights and responsibilities of fathers.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My Lords, in 1998 the Government conducted a review of the law on parental responsibility to consider making it easier for unmarried fathers to acquire parental responsibility. Following the review, the law was amended in 2003 so that unmarried fathers could acquire parental responsibility by jointly registering the birth of the child with the mother. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government believe that the definition of parental responsibility in the Children Act 1989 and case law sufficiently clarify what parental responsibility entails.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60426-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that helpful Answer. Does he agree that there is a great deal of good modern research that shows that the presence of a father in a family increases the chances of the child being a success in school and in later life? Is he aware&#151;I am sure that he is&#151;that more than 1 million of this country&#039;s children do not have a father who has parental responsibility for them and therefore do not have a father who can intervene in, help in, contribute to or make decisions about their education or care? Is it not time that the Government took steps to encourage more unmarried fathers to sign the birth register so that their children can also enjoy those benefits?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60426-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a number of pertinent and important points. We are strongly encouraging fathers to take joint responsibility for the upbringing of their children, and we can point to significant success over recent years. In 1989, only 71 per cent of births outside marriage led to joint registration by mothers and fathers of parental responsibility. In 2004, that figure increased to 83 per cent&#151;that was just one year after the change in the law in 2003 to enable unmarried parents to register births jointly and thereby both acquire parental responsibility. We have actively promoted that change in the law, and we hope that it will lead to a further increase in the proportion of unmarried parents who are jointly taking responsibility for the upbringing of their children.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that fathers who are married have considerable responsibilities, which do not need to be enlarged, but that fathers who are unmarried, perhaps even fathers who are divorced, need to have their responsibilities considered carefully?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord. That is precisely why we published parenting plans, which are now widely available, setting out the responsibilities of separating parents for their children to ensure that they take their responsibilities seriously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   My Lords, do the Government agree that the matter before us is about more than the rights of individual parents but concerns the needs of children? Because it is not working, is not a further review needed over and above the laudable efforts being made in relation to parenting about which we know?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the needs of children are immensely important. We are pushing further the obligations of parents so that the needs of children are effectively met.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the irresponsible fathers tend to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_145"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be young, feckless, chaotic, in casual relationships and often in need of the help of their own parents to grow into their responsibilities? Has he had any contact with or made arrangements to work with the Grandparents&#039; Association, so that those children may enjoy a three-generation family?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks with great authority on these issues. She is absolutely right about the importance of working with grandparents. We are doing so with their associations. The recent respect action plan, which particularly seeks to have an impact on fathers and parents who are not taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously, allocates &#163;70 million over two years to help parents to improve their parenting skills. All those interventions are particularly focused on the type of parents mentioned by my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that in order to achieve the objectives of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, we need to start early? Is he aware that many schools arrange for teenage girls to have supervised contact with real babies and toddlers so that they can prepare themselves for the responsibilities of motherhood later and at the same time learn about the reality, so as to discourage unwanted teenage pregnancies? Is there anything that the Government can do to encourage schools to do the same sort of thing for teenage boys, so that they understand the responsibilities, the difficulties and the joys of fatherhood?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the issues that the noble Baroness has mentioned are central to the PSHE curriculum, which is intended to foster greater awareness in schools of the obligations of parents and carers and the value of family life, including the changing nature of and pressures on relationships with friends and family; the role and importance of marriage and family relationships; the role and feelings of parents and carers; and the value of family life. We are investing considerable sums in training PSHE teachers in schools and enriching the PSHE curriculum to meet precisely the points that the noble Baroness set out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister give a reassurance that, vital as fathers are, in whatever legislative review that might take place the needs of children will remain paramount and, in that respect, any preventive work to help fathers where it is appropriate to engage with their children&#151;and indeed mothers&#151;will be encouraged?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely right about the importance of maintaining the paramount interests of the child. We are not, I should stress, envisaging a further legislative review over and above the changes proposed in the Children <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_146"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and Adoption Bill, which, as the noble Baroness knows, because we debated it together, are intended to foster precisely the objectives that she set out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, are the Government planning any tax changes to encourage marriage?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the changes that we have made to tax credit arrangements have significantly boosted the support that is available to parents, thanks to the investment that the Government have made over the past nine years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, in supporting the aims of my noble friend Lord Northbourne, would the Minister not agree that giving fathers exactly the same rights as mothers to request flexible working in the Work and Families Bill will enable them to play a far more active and responsible role in their children&#039;s lives?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, my best answer to that is to say that, as the noble Baroness knows, that is the subject of ongoing debates on that Bill.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60426-02_time0"></a><h5>3.22 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Sheldon </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What proportion of the expenditure by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is allocated to sport; and how this is expected to rise over the next five years in comparison with that of culture.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the department expects to spend 11.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent of its &#163;1.6 billion revenue budget on sport in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 respectively. Revenue spend on culture will fall from 73.7 per cent to 73.5 per cent over that period. The department expects to spend approximately 1 per cent of its &#163;127 million capital budget in both 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 on sport. Capital spend on culture will increase from 69.7 per cent to 70.8 per cent. Expenditure after 2007&#150;08 falls within the next spending review. The department&#039;s budgets for that period have not yet been set.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply, but is not the real danger that, when the Olympic bid finds itself short of money, state funding for the arts will suffer as a consequence? As the Arts Council&#039;s grants are frozen for the next three years, if the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is squeezed to provide for the Olympics, the arts will suffer even more. What assurance can my noble friend give that the arts will retain the proper consideration, which has been the situation up to now?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I certainly want to reassure the House that the arts will continue to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_147"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

receive appropriate expenditure. My noble friend will also recognise that the arts will play a significant role in relation to the Olympics as well, when we expect so many visitors to this country to enjoy not only the Olympics but our culture and heritage. We need to make provision for that.
</p>

<a name="60426-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>I assure my noble friend that it is not the intention for the Olympics to be funded out of tax receipts. The Olympics are being funded out of the lottery and the London council tax. He will recognise, therefore, that he ought not to have anxieties about the arts being squeezed because of progress on the Olympics. In any case, we expect the Olympics to keep to budget.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that to have culture and sport seen to be squabbling in the same department is supportive to neither? Have the Government given further thought to putting long-term support for sport into the Department of Health, which will ultimately be able to make savings if it manages to increase participation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60426-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, if the noble Lord will forgive me, I recall that a decade ago the pressure was exactly the other way round&#151;that there should be such a department. The previous administration accepted the argument for having a specific department for those areas, and indeed sport has grown in salience. We recognise that participation in sport helps other aspects of national life&#151;it improves the nation&#039;s health&#151;and that the success in winning the Olympic Games bid undoubtedly gives sport a higher profile in the whole country. However, I see no loss in relative expenditure between culture, which covers a wide range anyway, and sport. The fact that they are contained in one department is, I should have thought, a strength rather than a weakness.
</p>

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, what plans do Her Majesty&#039;s Government have for reforming or restructuring the funding mechanisms for national sports bodies, in line with the independent sports review &quot;Raising the Bar&quot; produced by my noble friend Lord Moynihan and Kate Hoey MP?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that important report is being studied carefully. The noble Lord will recognise that we have been concerned about administration in sport, and he is right to raise that issue. It has not always been the case that the quality of administration has matched either the necessary resources or the rightful expectations of potential recipients. I can report one obvious area of progress: Sport England has reduced its central staffing from 120 administrators to 90, which indicates the pressure being applied by the department and reflects the fact that sporting bodies need to get their house in order&#151;in terms of the quality of administration&#151;to justify the resources that they distribute.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, would it not be good if the Minister could say that he would consider <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_148"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington? Things change. The fact that something was put together in a department 10 or 20 years ago does not necessarily mean that it should stay like that for ever. There is now a big emphasis on sport which was not there at that stage&#151;it applies in particular, on the very points that the Minister made, to the spin-off for health, for obesity and for other issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is right, but the noble Baroness will have recognised from my initial figures that sport is still a small percentage of the department&#039;s allocation. The changes to the amounts spent on culture&#151;on heritage generally, in museums or on art&#151;are marginal. I hear what she says, and all suggestions on how we could organise government more effectively are to be taken into account. There is no doubt that sport, as I have indicated, has increased in importance to the nation. However, there is no case for reconstructing government on the basis of improvements to allocations to sport.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, how much money has been made out of the sale of school playing fields over the past 10 years? Does the Minister think that that was in the interests of promoting sport in this country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will not be surprised if I cannot quote the figure from the sale of school playing fields, but I assure her that their sale happens now only when other sporting facilities take their place and the proceeds are allocated to them. In fact, we are not prepared to see a reduction in sporting opportunities for our young people in schools. The resources from all sales go to improve playing facilities, which often means that a field that has more limited use&#151;being used only for certain sports&#151;can be translated into sports halls that can be used all year round and for a wider range of sports.

In March, we announced that, in future, those doctors would require work permits. A wide range of medical and NHS interests have been consulted at each stage.

I can say that employers of doctors and dentists who are in post or were offered before 7 March a post that starts before 4 August for which they do not have sufficient leave to complete can apply for work permits without needing to satisfy the resident labour market test. I shall give her further more detailed particulars.
</p>

<a name="60426-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>On the latter issue, we will of course consider any proposals put to us to improve the administration of the arrangements. It is worth telling the House that the changes were introduced because we were becoming very successful in expanding our medical schools, and we must ensure that postgraduate training places are available to UK medical graduates.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that, ever since the National Health Service was introduced in 1948, it has been hugely dependent on services given by overseas doctors, many of them coming from the Indian subcontinent? With the expansion of the UK medical school intake and with many doctors coming from within the EU, it is clearly important that their employment opportunities should be protected, but is it not invidious that many overseas doctors from outside the EU at present in post and in training positions find it impossible to obtain work permits to complete their training, having been assured when they came to the UK that they could complete that training without any difficulty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have not in any way changed the rules for work permits for doctors outside training posts. We have ensured that, as UK medical students graduate and need to move into postgraduate specialist medical training posts, there is an ample supply of those posts to be filled. Otherwise, we would be wasting the investment in the expansion of our medical schools. We are also concerned to become more self-sufficient, so that we do not drain doctors from overseas into this country. I share the concerns of the noble Lord; we recognise and pay tribute to the huge contribution that international medical graduates have made to the NHS and patients in this country.

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew10"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister take on board my concern and that of the BMA that the very least that is required is clear guidance to trusts, deaneries and, for that matter, the general public about what are highly complex rules&#151;not least, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_150"></a>

guidance about which particular categories of overseas doctor can work without a work permit? There is a considerable lack of clarity in that area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Earl is absolutely right: it is a complex area that has changed in many ways. The immigration system now has a different set of arrangements for its points rule. There is a very good website on UK work permits with a full explanation. We are working with NHS employers to ensure that their website is up to date and are in constant touch with the BMA about the issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister please clarify the position for overseas undergraduate medical students, of whom there are approximately 2,500 in this country, who came over to this country paying full fees at the very high rate that overseas students pay and believing that they could train at an undergraduate level and receive postgraduate training before returning to their own country? They now face enormous debts as a result of those fees.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there has been change for some time in this area, as I said in my original Answer. The General Medical Council has been working hard to stop young doctors coming here on spec to secure training. In the past year, there has been a 40 per cent drop in the number of overseas doctors taking the GMC&#039;s PLAB tests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that there is still a considerable shortfall of mental health professionals in the National Health Service? Can he say whether the arrangements for overseas doctors are likely to have an adverse impact on our ability to fill the gap in that area, which presumably will persist until the intake of students that we have been able to get as a result of the expansion of medical schools throws out professionals at the end of their training?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60426-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there are now 27,000 more doctors in the NHS than there were in 1997. We continue to expand medical schools. The needs of mental health services are being addressed considerably by the large expansion in the number of mental health staff, who are non-medical staff in many cases, an expansion that is needed to make those services more effective.

</ul>
<p>

<p><a name="st_58"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak to Amendment No. 3, which is grouped with it.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Naturally, we support measures that would reduce violent crime, but we shall certainly need to examine all the proposals in the Bill rigorously to ensure that they are both justified and effective. We are surely justified in our scepticism of the Home Office&#039;s ability to deliver its policies effectively given the shambles revealed this week whereby more than 1,000 foreign national criminals, who should have been considered for deportation or removal, completed their prison sentences and were released without the appropriate consideration of either deportation or removal action. That is shocking. I make it clear that I do not expect the Minister to have to respond on that issue today; I have already made that clear to him outside the Chamber. I believe it is not his direct area of responsibility, and I think it would be inappropriate to hold him to account for that today. However, I give notice now that I have drafted an amendment on this matter, within the scope of the Bill, for later debate. I have sought the advice of the Public Bill Office on whether it is within the scope of the Long Title. As a result of the late development of these matters today, it has not been possible for the Public Bill Office to consider it in time for me to make it clear now whether it will be tabled. If I receive the advice of the Public Bill Office that it is within the scope of the Long Title, the amendment will be published before the end of the week.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>We support measures to give the courts more effective powers to ban individuals from licensed premises if that will materially improve public order. We need to look carefully at whether the Government&#039;s plans for drinking banning orders are worth the bureaucratic new structure that they propose to build. Drinking banning orders are an odd beast. The Government present them as a civil order, but they wear the mantle of criminal design. Debates in another place did not dispel the confusion that lies at the heart of the creation of this new order. In our debates on the amendments in this part of the Bill, we shall try to persuade the Government to do rather better.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The amendments in this first group are probing. They seek to determine the scope of the potential prohibitions that could be included in a drinking banning order. This is a particularly important issue to be debated, given recent developments in the courts concerning anti-social behaviour orders. Of course, I appreciate that drinking banning orders are not the same as ASBOs, but they share certain characteristics, as was made clear by the right honourable Hazel Blears in another place.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_153"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>It is worth noting that earlier this month the High Court ruled that a prohibition included in an anti-social behaviour order imposed by a court was too wide. The particular prohibition banned the individual who was the subject of the order from behaving in an anti-social way for two years. That was deemed to be far too vague in its scope to be lawful. With that knowledge in mind of how wary the courts are when it comes to allowing orders and prohibitions of this kind, it is important that the Minister should clarify today exactly what the Government have in mind in Clause 1(1) and (2). Naturally, in this House we always seek to ensure that legislation is fit for purpose. If anything is left in the Bill that risks causing unnecessary difficulty in the courts at a later stage, I believe we need to address that matter now.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Subsection (1) explains that a drinking banning order would prohibit the individual subject to the order from doing the things described in the order. I was somewhat surprised to see the use of the word &quot;described&quot; instead of the term &quot;specified&quot;, which one would usually expect to see in this context. The word &quot;described&quot; conveys a rather more general and less explicit approach to setting out the terms of a drinking banning order. Is that what the Government intend? In any event, is that wise, given the ruling earlier this month by Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice David Clarke?
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment No. 1 simply replaces &quot;described&quot; with &quot;specified&quot;. Would not that use of the word &quot;specified&quot; make it crystal clear that the drinking banning order must be as explicit as possible in setting out precisely what a person is banned from doing?
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Subsection (2) states that a drinking banning order,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;may impose any prohibition on the subject&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>It qualifies that with the proviso that any such prohibition has to be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;necessary for the purpose of protecting other persons from criminal or disorderly conduct by the subject while he is under the influence of alcohol&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Subsection (3) specifies what must be included in the prohibition and subsection (4) specifies what must not be included.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>That begs the question: what, therefore, may be included? Paragraph 3 of the Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that there is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;the possibility of other relevant prohibitions also being included in the order&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>How does the Minister foresee this test of relevance being met? Amendment No. 3 suggests a couple of examples that might possibly be included. Can the Minister give the Committee further examples of what might be contained in such an order?
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Although the heading of the clause indicates that these orders are drinking banning orders, it seems that, given the width of Clause 1(2), they are not really confined at all to banning someone from drinking. Calling them &quot;drinking banning orders&quot; is, therefore, something of a misnomer within the current drafting of the Bill. I have tried to show that in Amendment No. 3.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_154"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I make it clear that at this stage I certainly do not seek to bring into the debate questions about the approved courses that are the subject of government amendments later on. We shall return to that point. I am simply asking the Minister to give examples of the prohibitions on behaviour that may form the basis of the order. Those are the prohibitions that would stand apart from any requirement that may be imposed by attendance at an approved course. I consider those to be separate.
</p>

<a name="60426-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Clause 22 gives the police powers to give directions to individuals who represent a risk of disorder, requiring them to leave a locality for up to 48 hours. Is it the Government&#039;s intention to provide in Clause 1 for powers that go beyond those powers in Clause 22? That would be tantamount to exclusion orders. It seems that these prohibitions could end up being extremely similar to bail conditions that the court can already impose, with the crucial difference that no criminal charge has been made against the individual concerned. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has done the Committee a singular service in pointing out two problems that arise. First, what does Clause 1 cover? Secondly, how do we avoid its breadth being tested in the courts? The structure of Clause 1 indicates that a drinking banning order is one that prohibits the individual against whom it is made from doing the things described or specified in the order. There is obviously no limitation involved in Clause 1(1). Clause 1(2) gives a broad discretion to impose any prohibition which is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;necessary for the purpose of protecting other persons from criminal or disorderly conduct by the subject while he is under the influence of alcohol&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>What does the phrase &quot;while he is under the influence of alcohol&quot; mean? In the criminal law we are familiar with the concept of a person being &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot;. Whether a person is drunk does not take a great deal of describing. However, &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; is a much vaguer term and does not involve the question of whether a person has been disinhibited by the effects of alcohol. So it is a very vague expression. What is the difference between being drunk&#151;a concept already punished by the criminal law&#151;and being under the influence of alcohol?
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The next issue that arises is whether the prohibition order can contain a prohibition on a person&#039;s conduct when he is sober. The order is necessary for the purposes of protecting other persons from criminal conduct by the subject &quot;while he is under the influence of alcohol&quot;. Supposing he is sober? Does he breach the order if he goes into a public house when he is sober if he is prohibited from doing so under Clause 1(3) when he is under the influence of alcohol? It is clearly a very important question. If a man goes into a pub sober, and then becomes drunk inside, has he breached a prohibition which prevents him &quot;entering&quot; licensed premises&#151;&quot;entering&quot; is the word used in Clause 1(3)&#151;when he is under the influence of drink? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_155"></a>

Divisional court, here we come: More money for lawyers for sorting out precisely what is the purport of that subsection.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The purpose of the Conservative amendments, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, is to flush out what sort of prohibition the Government have in mind. My Amendment No. 4 has the same purpose: to insert the word &quot;appropriate&quot; before &quot;necessary&quot; in Clause 1(3) so as at least to make sure that the prohibitions contained in a drinking banning order have something to do with drinking. We are all familiar now with the way in which ASBOs have been used. They have covered a variety of conduct which must go far beyond that in the minds of those who originally framed the legislation. They have been used to ban people from wearing caps, from keeping pigs or geese, from playing records of classical music and from sunbathing in a thong. All sorts of peculiar things have banned by ASBOs, and we are at least entitled to know what is to be the extent of a drinking banning order as set out in Clause 1. I await the Minister&#039;s reply with interest.

<a name="60426-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   I am sure I am not alone in being disappointed that the Statement made by the Home Secretary in another place has not been repeated here. It is appropriate to say just a few words about the appalling scandal revealed in the papers today, if only because we are now invited to discuss in Committee a Bill the title of which suggests that the Government are acting to reduce violent crime. It is quite ridiculous to suggest that the appalling scandal revealed in the papers is merely a failure on the part of officials to identify and consider for removal foreign criminals reaching the end of their sentences. Murderers, rapists, paedophiles, drug importers and other dangerous and violent offenders are on our streets because of the virtual abandonment of immigration control by this Government. That has resulted in hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants entering Britain, which in turn has resulted in a staggering increase in the number of foreign nationals in our gaols. If this is not a resignation matter, will the Minister please tell us in what circumstances the Home Secretary would think it right to resign?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60426-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Before I turn to the content of the amendments, I want to record my thanks to the noble Baroness for speaking to me earlier about her intention to raise the issue of the Home Secretary&#039;s Statement. I am grateful for her comments and like everyone else I await with interest the content of the amendments, which I am sure the noble Baroness will endeavour to ensure are within the scope of the Bill. They will be the subject for debate on another day. It is not appropriate for me to comment on the Statement; that is not what is in front of us, although obviously I respect the views of the noble Lord on the matter. I would have expected him to express them very forcefully. He is entitled to do so. However, this afternoon we are here to discuss this Bill, one that is a product of our policy: our determination to do all we can to ensure that there is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_156"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proper legal framework to counter violent crime on our streets. That is exactly what this series of practical measures is designed to do.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Baroness and to noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches for the practical expression of their support for the Bill and its intentions when it received its Second Reading in this House. I hope that our debates can be framed in what I have detected as a positive and pragmatic approach to a piece of legislation which has great merit in terms of the policy lying behind it. It is the kind of Bill with which noble Lords in this House will probably deal in a practical and hardnosed way, as they do quite properly when considering practical measures brought before the House which have a fair degree of support in the House.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I turn to the amendment moved by the noble Baroness and spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. Amendment No. 1 is probing in nature and seeks to redefine a drinking banning order as being one that prohibits the individual against whom it is made from doing the things specified rather than described in the order.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>In our view, the proposed amendment, although probative, is unnecessary and fails to add anything to the content of the wording of the Bill. For those reasons, I hope the noble Baroness will not press the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60426-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>As I am sure all noble Lords understand, Clause 1 introduces a new civil order&#151;a drinking banning order&#151;which will be available to protect persons and property from criminal or disorderly conduct by an individual while he is under the influence of alcohol. A drinking banning order could impose any prohibition on an individual that a court considers necessary to protect others against such conduct. This includes prohibitions with regard to an individual entering premises that sell alcohol and club premises that can supply alcohol to members and guests.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Amendment No. 3 would allow a drinking banning order to include prohibitions preventing an individual from coming within 10 metres of premises licensed to sell alcohol which have been specified by the court, or from associating with certain individuals. It is an interesting example, but the Bill already allows the courts to impose such prohibitions as it considers necessary. The example given by the noble Baroness is of a type that the court could quite properly consider but, in our view, there is no need to specify the type of prohibitions that the amendment proposes.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>We would expect the court to look at the circumstances of the offence to which the drinking banning order relates, and at the individual on whom the court is considering imposing a drinking banning order, to see what the prohibition could usefully cover. Seeking to constrain this in any way on the face of the Bill would not be practical and workable.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, seek, in spirit, to tighten the circumstances in which prohibitions can be imposed by a drinking banning order. I understand <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

why that is the case. The amendments seek to add a test of appropriateness before a prohibition can be included in an order. In our view, this is unnecessary because, if a prohibition is inappropriate, it could not be necessary. The amendments would also alter parliamentary counsel&#039;s drafting but would not add anything by doing so.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>If the intention is to ensure that the prohibitions included in an order take into account the circumstances of an individual and the impact that the order will have on him in going about his lawful, everyday business and so on, I can assure the Committee that we would expect the court to consider, in any event, the appropriateness of an order and any proposed prohibition in each and every case. The guidance will be all important in this regard. This, of course, will be published to accompany the measure and will make clear the circumstances in which prohibitions are inappropriate&#151;for example, where they would prevent a person from accessing his place of work or an educational establishment. I know that there are other amendments that seek to address those issues, to which we shall come later.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I am grateful for the amendments, which have been valuable. Having heard what I have said, however, I hope that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw or not move their amendments today.
</p>

<a name="60426-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The noble Baroness referred to some anti-social behaviour order cases. I heard what she said but, in our view, such cases do not necessarily break new ground. Any order that prevents someone from committing an act of anti-social behaviour could perhaps be too broad, but the prohibitions will have to be tailored to the circumstances of the individual. That is the general rubric and the way in which we intend to approach matters, given the powers set out in the Bill. I trust that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will feel content to withdraw or not move their amendments.

<a name="60426-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   The fundamental problem with ASBOs and this new drinking banning order is that they are sought as civil orders. This means that a different standard of proof applies and orders can be made on the basis of hearsay evidence. Tittle-tattle from the neighbours has been sufficient to found an ASBO on&#151;and anonymous tittle-tattle at that.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The problem that has arisen with ASBOs is that they have criminalised conduct that is not otherwise criminal. Since the breach of an ASBO&#151;whatever prohibition may be in it&#151;is a criminal offence, people have been sent to prison for up to five years for doing things for which they would not face a criminal charge initially. That has been the weakness and the problem behind the orders. I am concerned that drinking banning orders should not have that fatal flaw in them.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The proposed insertion of the word &quot;appropriate&quot;, which alters parliamentary counsel&#039;s drafting, is not a criticism of parliamentary counsel, who I have no doubt will never look at this Bill again once it has been passed; it will give a guideline to magistrates or to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

county court judge, whose job it is to impose the order in the first place. For the judge to have before him the word &quot;appropriate&quot;&#151;the direction that that order must be appropriate&#151;is important.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>It might be easy for a person seeking an order to paint such a picture that the tribunal thinks, &quot;Well, it is necessary to do something about this; it is necessary to impose this, that and the other prohibition&quot;. I would like to see a check on that thought process, so that the judge has to ask himself, &quot;Is what I am setting out in this order appropriate?&quot; &quot;Appropriate&quot; is an important word and I will return to it at a later stage of this Bill.

<a name="60426-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for his answer, even though it did not take us very much, if at all, further. I made it clear at the beginning that my amendments are probing and I stand by that. They were intended to tease out from the Government the extent of prohibitions. I have failed singularly in that, in a sense, because the Minister was kind enough to say that I had given interesting examples in Amendment No. 3 and that they were of a type that the court could properly consider. He said that he would expect the court to look at all the circumstances of the offence and the individual. That raises the very question that was addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;the hybridity of this matter, whereby we are talking about offences in one breath and a civil order in the other. That is an unhappy hybridity.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The whole point of my amendments was that I was trying to ask the Government what else could be given as guidance today, with regard to what would properly come within this provision. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, was seeking to do much the same thing by imposing the requirement of appropriateness with his amendment. I was trying to tease out some guidance about what might be appropriate for our future debates.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The Minister says that the Bill already allows for what I was seeking to achieve. Of course it does; the Bill allows for just about anything on this earth to be done, within human rights legislation, of course. That is why I find it unsatisfactory that the noble Lord should say that patience is to be rewarded and the guidance will make it clear&#151;the Minister nods sagely. Well, when? The Bill came to this House on 15 November, I think. That is a heck of a long while ago. Before further stages, we will be asking the Minister and his Bill team what progress they have made on guidance. It is a matter that we will return to time and again throughout the Bill. We will be particularly keen to get some idea of that guidance, because without it we will find that little has been achieved between the start of the Bill&#039;s passage in another place last June and its completion some time in June this year. Against that background, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 2 deals with another vagueness in Clause 1. The order may impose any prohibition on the subject which is necessary for the purpose of protecting other persons from &quot;criminal or disorderly conduct&quot;. That expression is used in a disjunctive way to separate two different types of conduct&#151;criminal and disorderly.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Criminal conduct is conduct punishable as a criminal offence by the courts. In terms of public order, we are already familiar, as I said a moment ago, with the concept of a person being guilty of the criminal offence of drunk and disorderly or of urinating in the street. Criminal offences arising out of a breach of public order are widespread: criminal damage; the use of threats of violence; harassment, including racial harassment; vandalism; the spreading of graffiti; the possession of dangerous dogs; and public disturbances. All those are criminal offences. So one has to ask the Minister: what disorderly conduct is not criminal? How do you distinguish between them? As Amendment No. 49, which is grouped with my amendments, suggests, does it mean conduct which is not in,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Is it something that is done privately? Is conduct disorderly when nobody can see it? If we start introducing drinking banning orders for what somebody does when nobody can see it, we are going an awful long way towards interfering in people&#039;s lives.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In the amendments that I have tabled, I have sought to get away from this disjunctive phrase &quot;criminal or disorderly&quot;. &quot;Criminal and disorderly&quot; might be better, but simply to leave it as &quot;criminal conduct&quot; would, in my view, be a better foundation for the imposition of orders of this type. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60426-06_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman: </b>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 49 in this group. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for having flagged this up for me. Like Amendment No. 2, it probes the necessity for introducing new legislation to tackle drunk and disorderly behaviour in this way. The matter was debated at some length in another place, and the answers there were unsatisfactory.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The question is essentially about the adequacy of existing legislation, a theme which runs right through the Bill. This is not the first time it has been raised. Clause 1(2) says that an order may be imposed to protect persons from &quot;criminal or disorderly conduct&quot; by the subject, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has said. This raises the question: what conduct is disorderly but is not also criminal? There are already plenty of public order offences on the statute book that address the problem of drunk and disorderly behaviour. The main point is this: if the conduct is tantamount to committing a criminal offence, it should be dealt with as such. Section 5 of the Public Order Act makes it an offence if a person uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, but adds a proviso that it has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_160"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 160</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to be within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. All our amendment would do is remove the proviso. In doing so, it shows that pretty much any behaviour&#151;for example, high spirits&#151;might pass the threshold for a drinking banning order.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Will the Minister provide an example of unacceptable conduct that is disorderly but not criminal? If he can provide such an example, why is the Public Order Act not being amended to catch such behaviour? I suspect that the reason why no such example will be forthcoming is that the Public Order Act already adequately covers the behaviour that most reasonable people would find unacceptable. If this is the case, DBOs are being introduced as a substitute for arrests and the Minister should come clean about it. No doubt, the police are overwhelmed in town centres on Friday and Saturday nights and do not have the resources to arrest people who in theory are committing an offence. We should then debate police resources and getting enough police officers on the ground to deal with criminal conduct appropriately rather than maintain a pretence that the problem can be addressed by giving more powers to the courts to deal with alcohol-fuelled disorder.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60426-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am grateful to both noble Lords for their attention to this part of the Bill. I shall turn first to the amendment spoken to by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and then come back to the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. Amendment No. 49 proposes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;&#039;disorderly conduct&#039; should include conduct that does not occur within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>In a sense, the amendment would add a gloss to the term &quot;disorderly conduct&quot;, making it clear that disorderly conduct which took place outside the hearing or sight of anyone likely to be caused distress, but which was perhaps captured on CCTV or witnessed by a police officer, would lead to a drinking banning order. We agree that such behaviour could be capable of leading to such an order, but the amendment is unnecessary. The ordinary meaning of &quot;disorder&quot; would in our view encompass such behaviour.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, would have the effect of restricting the circumstances in which an individual can be given a drinking banning order to engagement in criminal, but not disorderly, conduct. I know that the noble Lord has a sincerely held view about anti-social behaviour orders, which he does not like because of the way in which they are phrased and their civil nature, but one has to recognise that there are occasions and instances where it is hard to suggest that an act is criminal but to deny that it is anti-social and causes people distress, nervousness and alarm. Such an act is not always describable as a form of criminal activity. The noble Lord might want to consider also that his amendments would restrict the possible drinking <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_161"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

banning order prohibitions to those necessary to protect other persons from criminal, but not disorderly, conduct.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The Government are committed to tackling all aspects of alcohol-related and alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder. Noble Lords will be aware that alcohol misuse is a concern to many people in our communities and that behaviour of that sort may take the form of anti-social behaviour, which, as I have said previously, is not criminal in nature but can nevertheless have a significant and negative impact on many individuals in many of our communities. For that reason, this issue needs to be addressed, and there is substantial public support for our doing so.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Numerous recent statutes refer to both crime and disorder, including the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the Licensing Act 2003 and the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. In addition, key provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 refer to &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; as distinct concepts. This Bill enables courts separately to consider making a drinking banning order following conviction in criminal proceedings where the offender was under the influence of alcohol when the offence was committed.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>It does not seem to be entirely appropriate, in line with our policy or in keeping with recent legislation to retain both crime and disorder in the drinking banning order provisions. It is important that we do not seek to restrict the circumstances in which an individual can be given a drinking banning order to criminal but not disorderly conduct.
</p>

<a name="60426-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I was asked for examples of what might constitute disorderly conduct but might not necessarily be caught by the criminal law. Activities such as causing a noise nuisance and disturbance, kicking dustbins late at night, setting off fireworks at an inappropriate time or shouting or swearing in the street could be considered disorderly conduct, but might not necessarily, depending on the circumstances, be a criminal offence. Those are the kinds of thing that would be commonly considered in those terms. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw or not move the amendments having heard what I have had to say on the subject.

<a name="60426-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   The Minister has just pointed out that in previous legislation the phrase &quot;crime and disorder&quot; has been used, and not &quot;crime or disorder&quot;, so one seeks to find out why the disjunctive word is used here. None of the examples that the Minister has given really amounts to a justification for banning people from public houses and placing on them any prohibition the court may think fit. If the purpose is to impose a drinking banning order on someone whose conduct is caught on CCTV but does not affect another member of the public, that is even worse.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I intend by these amendments to restrict the scope of the drinking banning order. I think it important that we do that. The answer that the Minister gave on two occasions was, &quot;We do not want to restrict in any way the scope of the order&quot;. Any sort of conduct that could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_162"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be described as someone causing a noise or making a nuisance of themselves could lay that person open to the drinking banning order. The reason why the Government do not wish to confine the matter to criminal conduct is that, if it were criminal conduct and a criminal offence had been committed, that would have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt on proper evidence. Only by that route could it lead to a person being in prison. That is the sanction at the end of it all; if the drinking banning order is breached, a person goes to prison.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>To take the Minister&#039;s examples, he suggests that shouting or kicking a dustbin could give rise to a drinking banning order. If an order is made with a prohibition against kicking dustbins, and the person does it again, he can be fined under this Bill. If he fails to pay the fine, he can go to prison. What is he going to prison for? For kicking a dustbin.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>A lot has been said recently. The Home Secretary, whose future is so much under discussion at the moment, made it clear that he was dissatisfied with descriptions that have been given in this House and elsewhere of the conduct of this Government as authoritarian. But when they introduce a law that threatens a person with imprisonment in the long run for kicking a dustbin, how dare they deny that this is an authoritarian society? Having made that point for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;( ) from having access to or contact with members of his family (whether under the terms of a court order or under the terms of an agreement with his partner); or

<br>
( ) from taking his child or children to a place where they may receive medical treatment.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_69"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 114.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>These amendments add to the list of restrictions on what can be prohibited under a drinking banning order under Clause 1(4). That subsection safeguards the individual&#039;s access to his residence, place of employment and education or medical services. Paragraph (d) also allows the individual to attend a location that he has been ordered to attend by statute or court order. The purpose of these amendments is to test whether these restrictions on the scope of a drinking banning order are sufficient. Can the Minister explain on what criteria these limitations have been selected? If he thinks that it is safe to leave the question of the fairness of particular prohibitions to the discretion of the courts, it begs the question why any limitations have been included at all. Is the Minister entirely satisfied that Clause 1(4) provides sufficient protection to the rights of the individual?
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The amendments would impose a further limitation to a DBO by ensuring that a subject can always have access to his family. Surely that is a right that also <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_163"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

needs to be safeguarded. Contact with a member of one&#039;s family would not fall under the mandatory obligations contained in court orders safeguarded in paragraph (d). How can it be guaranteed that any prohibition made as part of a drinking banning order will be compatible with access to one&#039;s family? The example of accommodation tied to a licensed premises poses a particular problem, but there must be other situations in which the issuing of a DBO might conflict with family interests and access to children. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60426-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As I explained earlier, Clause 1 introduces a new civil order, a drinking banning order, which is available to protect persons and their property from criminal or disorderly conduct by an individual while he or she is under the influence of alcohol. A drinking banning order could impose any prohibition on an individual that a court considers necessary to protect others against such conduct. That includes prohibitions with regard to an individual entering premises that sell alcohol and club premises that can supply alcohol to members and guests.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Amendment No. 6 seeks to stipulate two situations in which a drinking banning order could not impose prohibitions on an individual. As the noble Lord explained, the first is that no prohibition should prevent a subject having access to or contact with members of their family, whether under the terms of a court order or under the terms of an agreement with his partner. The second is that an individual should not be prevented from taking his child or children to a place where they may receive medical treatment. The Bill already sets out certain effects that a prohibition cannot have, such as preventing an individual attending his place of work. These provisions ensure that we do not end up with perverse prohibitions that would inappropriately impact upon the subject of a drinking banning order.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I understand the basis of the noble Viscount&#039;s amendments. However, there may be instances where the court may wish to impose a prohibition to protect family members from an individual&#039;s behaviour while under the influence of alcohol. So I am not persuaded that this amendment is necessary. However, I recognise that we would not want courts to impose prohibitions in drinking banning orders that would prevent an individual taking his child or children to a place where they may receive medical treatment. I expect that noble Lords could quote a never-ending list of similar situations where prohibitions would be inappropriate and should not be imposed. However, I believe that such matters are best left to the discretion of the court to consider on a case-by-case basis. However, I am happy to ensure that the kind of example that the noble Viscount drew to our attention is included in drinking banning order guidance, as it fits exactly the requirements that we will have to set out so that it can be best understood by those who would give effect to the orders.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_164"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Amendment No. 114 is the same as that which has been proposed for drinking banning orders, but for directions to leave. I believe that it is therefore appropriate to discuss it at the same time, and the noble Viscount has grouped it with Amendment No. 6. Clause 22 allows a constable to direct a person to leave a locality. Subsection (4) provides that no prohibition can be given by a constable if it prevents the individual to whom it is given having access to his home, to his place of work, to a place that he needs to attend to receive education, training or medical treatment, or to a place that he has been ordered to attend. The amendment would, again, add the same two situations as those proposed in the amendment on drinking banning orders.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>For directions to leave, the provisions already in the Bill seek to set out the situations in which lack of access would be highly counter-productive for the individual, such as being unable to attend his place of employment. They are the basics required to ensure that we do not end up with nonsensical unintended consequences. Again, I am not persuaded that it would be right to include anything in the Bill on the need to ensure that the direction does not prevent someone having access to, or contact with, members of his family. It is already the case that a direction to leave cannot prevent someone having access to his home&#151;that is where a person&#039;s family is most likely to live. A direction lasts only for a maximum of 48 hours, so it is a very short-term arrangement.
</p>

<a name="60426-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I recognise that we would not want a direction to be given that prevented an individual taking his child or children to a place where they might receive medical treatment. I am not sure under what circumstances that might arise, as the basis for a direction to leave is that it should be given only if it is necessary to prevent alcohol-related crime or disorder and it can last only for a maximum 48 hours. It is most likely that directions will be given from a town or city centre and the area that has a concentration of pubs and clubs. However, as in the case for drinking banning orders, I am happy to ensure that this is covered specifically in guidance on directions to leave. I hope that, with those assurances, the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

(4C) If the court determines that the proposed subject of a drinking banning order may be a person falling within subsection (4B)(a) to (c), the court shall not make a drinking banning order unless satisfied, on receipt of medical evidence, that&#151;


<br>
(a) his ability to understand and comply with the order will not be significantly restricted by reason of his being a person falling within subsection (4B)(a) to (c); and


<br>
(b) compliance with the order, either alone or in combination to any other order or sentence to which he is subject, would not have a deleterious effect upon his mental or physical health.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_73"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment raises a very important issue, which I am sure the Minister will address. Is it intended that these drinking banning orders will be applied to rough sleepers who are alcohol or drug-dependent? Is it a mechanism for removing from the streets people who are suffering from alcoholism in one way or another? If that is the case, then a person suffering from that sort of illness is bound to breach any prohibitions that are put on him or her, and a drinking banning order would just be one step towards fines and subsequent imprisonment.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We welcome the government amendments in the group commencing with Amendment No. 8, which deal with the introduction of approved courses to treat alcoholism, and that will be discussed in due course. But it seems to me that the introduction of the approved courses idea by the Government brings in a considerable refinement to the Bill as first put before another place.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>A major effect is that the drinking banning order will not be the crude and simplistic,

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>to use the words of Miss Hazel Blears on 13 October last year. It is an order intended to deal with people&#039;s problems, as well as to give them a short, sharp shock. If the orders are to be tailored to deal with an individual by, for example, different prohibitions for different periods, as set out in the original Bill, by an order that a person should attend an approved course, or by the possibility that a particular prohibition can be terminated and so on, then it is necessary to have full and proper information about the individual before the court.

</p>

<a name="60426-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Amendment No. 7 does not require a report in every case, but if unusual prohibitions are to be contained in the order, or if it deals with a person with an unusual personality, it is only sensible to have a report from an appropriate person, as defined. If, as I have said, the orders are imposed on people who are rough sleepers, surely a report from the Department of Social Services should be available to the court before it considers what prohibitions should be placed on that person.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Further, when there is reason to think that a person may be suffering from drug or alcohol dependence, or any other recognised physical or mental illness, it is only sensible, as the amendment suggests, to have a professional medical view. The order that the judge who hears the application will make will be a matter for his discretion, and the prohibitions that he imposes will also be a matter for his discretion. Therefore, he should have all the available assistance from social services and the medical profession that are relevant to the case. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60426-08_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman: </b>   I support the amendment, to which my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns has added her name. It would be helpful in some cases if a report were made available to the court before it made a drinking banning order. It is a sensible proposal that should not lead to too great a burden on the court or on those with responsibility for preparing the reports.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>We are all concerned about the heavy workload carried by the Probation Service, which has been highlighted in recent very tragic cases, especially in light of the extra burden that it will face at the end of this year when custody plus sentences come into effect. Despite the fact that the DBO is a civil order, it would be valuable if a report could be called for by the court when it believes that it will assist it more effectively to determine whether an order should be made and what prohibition should appropriately be imposed.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The amendment is even more appropriate in the light of the Government&#039;s new clauses that open up the prospect of a court ordering that a person should be offered the chance to complete an approved course, to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has referred, and get a discount on the length of their DBO as a result. I hope that the Government can accept the amendment.

<a name="60426-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I hear what the noble Viscount says and should perhaps say at the outset that I am going to disappoint him. However, I think that I can give him some cause for cheer.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and supported by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, seeks to introduce safeguards into the process of making a drinking banning order. As explained, the amendment would mean that any court considering making an order may first receive a report from an appropriate person on the subject&#039;s mental and physical health and whether he or she has any substance misuse addictions. We have a great deal of sympathy with the aim behind the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_167"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment. The image conjured up by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, of the rough sleeper is one that I readily understand as my own city has a fair problem of exactly that nature. It is only right and proper that policies should be directed towards giving assistance and help, which is the spirit in which the amendment has been moved. I understand that.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The amendment would ensure that an order is not imposed unless the court is satisfied that the subject can understand and comply with the order, and that it will not have an adverse effect on his mental or physical health. We know that rough sleepers, who are a part of our community, invariably have mental and physical health problems. This amendment was tabled and debated in the other place and my colleagues there had a similar sympathy with it. I understand the importance of the issue and agree with the aim, but in our view there is no need to set out the requirement in the Bill. I give the assurance that this issue will be dealt with in guidance, as is the case with anti-social behaviour orders. To our way of thinking that seems the best way of dealing with it.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a> It is already the case that local authorities have a duty under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 to assess any person who may be in need of community care services. If there is any evidence to suggest that the person against whom the order is being sought may be suffering from drug, alcohol or mental health problems, the person&#039;s circumstances should be properly assessed and the necessary support provided by social services or other relevant agencies. That support should run parallel with the collection of evidence and application for an order where that is deemed necessary.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a> When applying for an order against a young person an assessment should be made of their circumstances and needs in each and every case. That will enable the local authority to ensure that the appropriate services are available or are going to be provided for the young person affected and for the court to obtain the necessary information about his or her circumstances. However, it is vital that any such assessment does not introduce delay to the application process for an order as the needs of the community should be paramount. The lead agency should work closely with the local social services department or youth offending team from the start of the process so that where a new assessment is required it can be made speedily.
</p>

<a name="60426-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a> As I said, the Government will ensure that those considerations are set out in the detailed and comprehensive guidance that will be an important part of ensuring that the legislation when it reaches the statute book becomes operational. I hope that having heard that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

report for the decision maker, whether it is a magistrate or a civil judge, to have before him when he sets out the various prohibitions that he wishes to impose in a drinking banning order. If I could have assurance that guidance would be to the effect that a judge must consider whether a report is necessary and call for it there would not be any need for me to pursue the amendment. But as it stands and in the absence of any further assurance, it is a matter that I shall pursue. Perhaps the Minister would like to consider it between now and Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60426-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for extending that invitation. As I understand it, the amendment in any event seeks to create a situation where before an order is made the court may receive a report from the appropriate person&#151;probably social services. I made it clear in my comments that when an order is sought, particularly against a young person, an assessment will be made of their circumstances and needs in every case, which will enable the local authority to ensure that the appropriate services are available or can be provided to the young person concerned. The assumption would be that a report should be formulated.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>A statutory requirement will be placed on the police and on the local authority to consult each other. That will help to identify vulnerable people. I have no doubt that before an order is sought there will be partial reliance on the wisdom of local services. As I am sure the noble Lord will appreciate, the expectation is that the police and the local authority, in seeking to tackle the problems associated with alcohol in those terms, will work closely together before seeking to make use of a drinking banning order in relation to other criminal activity driven by alcohol. The expectation is that there will be close liaison and that the information required before an order is made is available to the court.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I will, however, reflect further on the noble Lord&#039;s other points. This is something that we can pick up between now and Report.

<a name="60426-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   In his earlier remarks, the noble Lord was not clear whether the court would have a duty to consider whether a report was necessary. However, he made it clear that rough sleepers, people suffering from alcohol dependence and perhaps drug dependence are not excluded from this Bill. It is not just a Bill to deal with binge drinking by young people. It obviously has much wider connotations. I shall read carefully what he said. I hope we can return to this in a constructive way when we get to Report. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

commenting on the government amendments, I shall also comment for the convenience of noble Lords on amendments that have been made to them.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Reference has already been made to some of the issues that these amendments cover. I ought to place on record the Government&#039;s gratitude to Humfrey Malins, who suggested many of the ideas which we have attempted to encapsulate within the amendments. No doubt other contributors to this debate will draw further on Mr Malins&#039; important initiative.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>In Committee in the other place, the Government gave a commitment to consider whether positive requirements to address alcohol misuse behaviour could be attached to a drinking banning order. During Second Reading in this House, my noble friend Lady Scotland confirmed that we would indeed be tabling new clauses to this effect.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The first new clause&#151;Amendment No. 8 and associated Amendments Nos. 9, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29 and 32&#151;will enable individuals who are subject to a drinking banning order to undertake a course to address their alcohol misuse and enable them to confront it.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>A court will be able to propose to an individual that they attend an improved course. The court can do this if it is satisfied that a place is available for the individual; if the individual has voluntarily agreed to attend the course, this can be included in the drinking banning order.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Before attendance of an approved course is included in an order, the individual must be informed&#151;in plain language in writing, or by other means&#151;of what attendance on the course will involve, any fees that they would need to apply and at what time they would need to be paid. If the court decides it is not going to include a provision in a drinking banning order for an individual to attend an approved course, it must give its reasons for not doing so in open court.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>This new clause makes it clear that the duration of a drinking banning order&#151;known as the &quot;specified period&quot;&#151;can last for between two months and two years. Different prohibitions within a drinking banning order can also take effect for different periods, known as the &quot;prohibition period&quot;. The new clause provides that the terms of a drinking banning order or the prohibitions contained within it may cease to apply before the end of the specified period or prohibition period if an individual successfully completes an approved course specified in their order.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The court would set a time when a drinking banning order or prohibition would cease to have effect should the individual satisfactorily complete an approved course. The court would also decide the appropriate reduction in length of the drinking banning order or prohibition and state the date by which the individual would need to complete the course.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>An order or prohibition cannot cease to have effect until at least half of the specified period or the prohibition period. Therefore, an individual would have to serve over half the duration of a drinking banning order&#151;or prohibition in such an order&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before it can cease to have effect. The Secretary of State will be able to make regulations, subject to the affirmative procedure, to modify the earliest time at which an order or prohibition can cease to have effect. That will enable the minimum duration of a drinking banning order or their prohibition to be adjusted if it is necessary to do so in the light of experience.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We are making some consequential amendments to the drinking banning order clauses to reflect this new provision. Amendments Nos. 21 to 23 in Clause 4 and Amendments Nos. 27 to 29 in Clause 7 reflect the introduction of &quot;a relevant local court&quot; in relation to a drinking banning order, meaning a magistrates&#039; court acting for the local justice area in which the subject normally resides. Amendment No. 32 in Clause 8 changes &quot;the permission of the justices&#039; clerk&quot; to that of a &quot;proper officer&quot;, also in consequence of the new clauses being introduced.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 10 to 14, tabled by Conservative Members of the Committee, which relate to the new clause. Amendments Nos. 10 to 12 appear to propose that courses should cover such issues as rehabilitation, alcohol awareness and anger management. The courses may cover such issues but in our view there is no need to specify that in the Bill. The content of courses needs to be flexible so as to address an individual&#039;s alcohol misuse behaviour. On Amendment No. 13, which would ensure that an individual is informed &quot;in an accessible format&quot; about what attendance on a course will involve, we say that the Bill already specifies that such information should be provided in plain language in any event&#151;in writing, or otherwise. It is best left to the court to decide how to inform the individual. With regard to Amendment No. 14, we can also leave it to the court to decide how they will inform the subject of the implications of not completing a course. Where it is appropriate to do so, these matters can be covered in guidance.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I also need to speak to Amendment No. 37, which will give effect to the second new clause on the duration of a drinking banning order. It sets out the basis for operating and running approved courses. Applications can be made to the Secretary of State to run a course addressing an individual&#039;s alcohol misuse behaviour. In deciding whether to approve a course, the Secretary of State will have regard to a course&#039;s proposed content and whether the person providing and administering the course is an appropriate person to do so. In reaching that decision the Secretary of State may seek the views of others appointed to consider those applications.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>A course may be approved subject to specific conditions that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. That will ensure that course content is appropriate and targeted specifically at addressing alcohol misuse behaviour which has become subject to the drinking banning order. Once a course is approved it can remain in place for up to seven years. Approval can, however, be withdrawn at any time that is considered necessary. The Secretary of State is given a power to make regulations covering, among other things, the payment of fees for the consideration and approval of applications, the maximum fees that an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_171"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

individual may pay to attend a course and the monitoring both of courses and those providing them. He may also issue guidance on the conduct of courses.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>So, this new clause provides for an effective regime to be in place to ensure that courses to address the behaviour of those subject to an order are operated professionally and should make a positive contribution to our societal efforts to reduce alcohol-related crime and disorder.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Opposition Amendments Nos. 38 to 41 seek to alter our approach. Amendment No. 40 seeks to restrict applications for running courses to not-for-profit organisations. I understand the motive behind that, but we do not want to restrict applications for running courses on that basis, which could otherwise restrict the number of organisations that might be suitable&#151;and have the right experience in running courses aimed at addressing alcohol misuse behaviour. Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 41 together propose that rather than saying regulations may be made about the approval of a course, &quot;may&quot; would be replaced with &quot;shall&quot;. To us, that seems unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I need also to speak to the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 42 and the consequential Amendments Nos. 48, 50, 51, 56 and 57. This is the third new clause that we are introducing. It provides for a certificate to be given to an individual who has satisfactorily completed an approved course and for a written notice to be issued if it is decided not to give a certificate. When an individual has satisfactorily completed an approved course, the court must provide a certificate. An individual would be considered to have successfully completed the course once the certificate has been received by the court.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The Secretary of State can make regulations specifying the form of the certificate and any particulars it must contain and cover. A course provider must give a certificate unless the individual undertaking the course fails to pay the course fees, fails to attend the course as instructed or fails to comply with any other reasonable requirement of the course provider. If the course provider cannot issue a certificate, it must give the individual written notice of that decision and their reasons. The course provider must issue a certificate or a notice within 14 days of being asked to by the individual. As with certificates of satisfactory completion, the Secretary of State is given a power to make regulations on the form of the notices that are issued when an individual fails to satisfactorily complete the course. The remaining government Amendments Nos. 48, 50, 51, 56 and 57 are consequential.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that the introduction of approved courses to help individuals subject to drinking banning orders to change their behaviour is a very positive step. By allowing courts to reduce the length of an order or its prohibitions, we are creating a sensible incentive for individuals to address their behaviour. We feel that that combination of imposing prohibitions on an individual and providing educational interventions will increase the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_172"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

effectiveness of drinking banning orders in addressing alcohol-related crime and disorder. I commend the new clause and the associated amendments.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I now turn to opposition Amendments Nos. 43 to 45, 58 and 59. Amendments Nos. 43 and 45 propose the inclusion of a new subsection so that if an individual who is subject to a drinking banning order is unable to complete a course because the person providing the course ceases to operate under the conditions approved by the Secretary of State, he may make an application to the court that made the order to issue a certificate of the approved course. I agree that a person should not suffer a detriment if he has done all that is required of him but, before he has completed the course or obtained a certificate, the course provider ceases to operate.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>However, experience from drink/drive intervention courses, from which the provision is very much drawn, shows that that is a very unlikely scenario. In respect of the courses for drink-drivers, which have operated on an experimental basis since 1993, and in all court areas since 2000, we are not aware of a single case where the provider has ceased to operate without first giving a period of notice. The Secretary of State can approve and withdraw approval for behaviour intervention courses. Therefore, conditions can be set when approving a course to ensure that adequate notice is given if a course provider decides that it no longer wishes to provide a course.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>If a course ceases to operate under the conditions approved by the Secretary of State, approval for the course can be withdrawn. Such action should be timed so as to ensure that those already attending a course delivered by the provider in question are not adversely affected, but also so as to ensure that no new referrals to the course take place. Although that scenario is very unlikely, the most likely outcome would be that the person would be referred to another provider to continue to complete the course. That provider would then issue the certificate of completion.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In any event, I do not believe that a court would be well placed to make judgments about whether a person has fulfilled the attendance and other requirements of a behaviour intervention course without making time-consuming inquiries. So I assure the Committee that these matters will be covered in detail in guidance and that the amendments proposed are for that reason unnecessary. The subject of a drinking banning order is to be regarded as having completed an approved course satisfactorily if and only if the person providing the course has issued a certificate stating that the subject has done so.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Amendment No. 44 seeks to remove &quot;, and only if,&quot;. This amendment, too, is unnecessary, as this is the only basis on which an individual would have satisfactorily completed the course. The person providing an approved course must give the individual a certificate of completion unless the individual has, among other things,

</p>

<a name="60426-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Amendment No. 46 proposes to omit this requirement and would, in our view, unnecessarily limit the situations under which a certificate may not be given.
</p>

<a name="60426-09_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Amendments Nos. 58 and 59 seek to change amendments that we have tabled. Amendment No. 58 seeks to ensure that no regulations are made under Section 11 unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution in each House. Amendment No. 59 seeks to remove:

<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-09_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The government amendments, which the amendments seek to change, set out the parliamentary procedure for regulations and orders made under Chapter 1 of Part 1. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which has obviously had the chance and the opportunity to comment on the Bill, has not objected to these or to the proposed level of parliamentary scrutiny. For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendments. I apologise for having detained the House at length over the amendments, but I thought that the issues to which they give rise needed to be given our very fair consideration. I also wanted to set out in some detail the effect of the government amendments. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I would like to speak to Amendments Nos. 10 to 14, 38 to 41, 43 to 46, 58 and 59, 15 of which are in eight sub-groups. If the Government&#039;s new clauses had appeared in the original draft of the Bill, we might have had the luxury of dealing with these very important matters in separate groupings. I would therefore have de-grouped them and not burdened the House with a long speech, which I now have to give to respond to the Government&#039;s presentation of these clauses.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>First, I put on record the fact that I am very grateful to the Minister for trying to address some of my amendments immediately. He has managed to take away some of the information that I shall have to give, but not a lot, I have to say. He was right to say that the Government have responded helpfully to proposals advanced by my honourable friend Humfrey Malins in another place. The difficulty is that, in tabling these new amendments last Thursday, the Government have at first blush given a much wider power to the courts than my honourable friend had anticipated. I therefore tabled the amendments to try to probe the Government&#039;s intentions very fully. The letter that was sent to me and, I suspect, to other noble Lords who spoke on Second Reading merely says that the new proposals allow courts to refer an individual to attend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_174"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

voluntarily an approved alcohol intervention course, the successful completion of which could lead to a reduction in the length of the drinking banning order. The letter goes on to say that the Government believe that this will complement the drinking banning order arrangements by addressing an individual&#039;s behaviour as well as imposing prohibitions on them. That rather limited explanation is the reason why I felt I had to table a series of amendments to give the Bill team at least the hope of trying to work out where my objections might lie.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>All my amendments today are probing, and we will need to consider the Government&#039;s further responses before deciding whether these new clauses need to be improved on Report or whether everything can satisfactorily be left to guidance, which I think will be the mainstay of the Minister&#039;s speaking notes at all stages of the Bill, by the sound of it. We may have to help him to put guidance into the Bill before it leaves this House.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="60426-10_time0"></a><h5>5 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60426-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Although these new clauses may well prove to be welcome, as I think they will be, we in this House are the only ones who will have the luxury of time to debate them properly. When they go to another place they will form part of the whole group of Lords amendments, and we know that the time allocated for consideration of Lords amendments is notoriously inadequate. That is my apology for taking some time on them today.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Have the Government consulted Alcohol Concern or any other related organisation on the specific drafting of these new clauses, and if so, with what results? As soon as I saw the amendments, I telephoned Alcohol Concern and although, understandably, staff were on leave at last week, I want to put on record my heartfelt thanks to Helen Symons at Alcohol Concern for turning around a response this week. Broadly speaking, she said that Alcohol Concern very much welcomes the fact that the Government have responded to the argument that the punitive action of the DBOs needs to go hand-in-hand with proactive measures to change the way people drink if it is to be truly effective. She has given a list of very pertinent questions. I have tried to incorporate them into my list of questions on the relevant amendments. As this is a late submission by Helen Symons, I was able to look at them only at two o&#039;clock today, so I have not been able to give advance notice of the questions to the Minister. However, having gone through them today, I shall be happy to provide the e-mail to his Bill team later on.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>My first subgroup of amendments comprises Amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12. It probes the purpose of the approved course that is to be specified in the order. The amendments severally describe the approved courses as promoting rehabilitation, alcohol awareness and anger management. Amendment No. 10, which triggered all this off, is the one that was tabled by my honourable friend Humfrey Malins in another place.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_175"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I do not intend to go into the detail of what those three objectives might achieve&#151;I think the Minister has addressed that. He has said why he does not think it is right to put the detail of that in the clause itself. My questions relate to why the Government have overcome their initial objection. On 13 October, the Government rejected the proposal of my honourable friend Humfrey Malins on the basis that DBOs are civil orders and not criminal penalties. Hazel Blears stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;When there is a conviction, it is . . . open to the court to direct a mandatory course of action involving rehabilitation, education, drug support and drink support&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 13/10/05; col. 22.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>She quite rightly pointed out that human rights issues are involved and that it would be wrong to force people to take up treatment if they do not wish to do so in the absence of a criminal penalty. She said, of course, that she would take it away for consideration and today we have the result.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>This means that the Government have to address the question of why they are now sure that these proposals do not offend against the human rights issues referred to by Hazel Blears. I am glad that the Government think they do not offend, but I think that we and, in future, the courts need to be reassured that they do not offend human rights issues. Of course, I appreciate that the Government&#039;s proposals have the advantage of not, strictly speaking, forcing an individual to go on an approved course; they ask an individual to agree to that. However, offering a discount is such an inducement that it will be very difficult for someone to say, &quot;No&quot;. If people are being offered a reduction in the period of a DBO if they take up a course and complete it satisfactorily, I need to be reassured that that does not offend against the principles that governed the Minister in the other place saying that this was not a way forward.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>My second subgroup comprises Amendment No. 13, which relates to the Government publicising this in an accessible format. The Minister says that this is already covered because they will put out the information about the DBOs in plain language and that that covers it. However, Amendment No. 9 says that the court must provide the information &quot;whether in writing or otherwise&quot;. I would like to know what the &quot;or otherwise&quot; conveys. It might mean that it could be in Braille, Easyread or in some format that was accessible to someone who could not necessarily read it; it could be translated into another language. I do not think &quot;plain language&quot; covers it. I just want to be reassured about what &quot;or otherwise&quot; might convey.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The third subgroup comprises Amendment No. 14. This would require the court to give a warning about the possible consequences of a failure to complete the course. The Minister says, &quot;Let us leave that to the court to decide&quot;. I had in mind a situation where a court currently imposes a community penalty. The court is required to give guidance to a person before it on what will happen to them if they do not complete the course. It might be helpful for courts to be advised that this is good practice and that as a matter of course <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_176"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they should give guidance about the possible consequences of failing to complete.<i> </i>That might make a person more ready to let the people running the course know as soon as possible if they were unable to attend on a particular day for a good reason&#151;it might be to attend the funeral of a close relative or to attend a job interview. I want to get that good practice into the system. We keep being told that we should not worry as it will be in the guidance, but we are not seeing the guidance. That is why I need to be persistent&#151;nay awkward and difficult&#151;and to keep asking the questions today.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I now move on to the amendments that affect the Government&#039;s new clause on approved courses. The next subgroup&#151;Amendments Nos. 38 and 40&#151;probes the nature of the organisations or persons that the Government expect to license the approved courses. The Government say they do not want to restrict the kind of persons or organisations who could run this. But&#151;and I welcome his statement here&#151;the Minister said that they need the right experience. That is absolutely right. Alcohol Concern points out that it is crucial that whoever runs the course is properly trained in delivering alcohol interventions. Are the Government really intending that these courses will be delivered only by social services and probation services? Can they give an assurance that other relevant organisations&#151;charities and people with real experience in this field&#151;would be favourably considered as organisations qualified to run these approved courses?
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The fifth subgroup is covered by Amendments Nos. 39 and 41. These are the old-fashioned &quot;may/shall&quot; amendments and are intended to probe the nature of the regulations made by the Secretary of State in relation to the approval of courses that may be undertaken. Amendment No. 39 would require the Secretary of State to take into account any recommendations made by persons appointed by the Secretary of State to consider applications to run approved courses. Amendment No. 39 has been tabled because I want to know who will be processing these applications to run courses. Will it be Home Office civil servants? Will it be an independent body appointed by the Secretary of State to process the applications? Will it be in-house or out of house? Will it be in-house, with a specifically nominated group of civil servants who would have expertise, or will it be out of house, with an independent body of persons appointed with long experience in these matters? Alcohol Concern says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;We would like to seek assurances that the Secretary of State will consult with experts in the field before approving the content of any courses, and that the focus of the course will be changing behaviour, not just raising awareness&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;It is important that the course is linked in with the Department of Health&#039;s focus on screening and brief interventions to ensure that everyone who comes through the course is referred on to appropriate treatment if necessary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>That seems to be very wise advice.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Amendment No. 41 requires the Secretary of State to include in the regulations the matters set out in subsection (5). The provisions to be covered in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulations are significant and it would be unthinkable if the Secretary of State were not to include them in the regulations. This &quot;may/shall&quot; amendment is simply there to probe the details behind the matters listed in subsection (5). Paragraph (a) is a provision for the making of applications for approval. Does this mean prescribing the administration of processing applications? There are good management issues here, such as the time to process the applications and the reasons to be given if the Secretary of State refuses an application. Is that what the Government intend to be covered?
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Subsection (5)(b) covers the provisions on the payment of fees. Do the Government expect different charges to be set in different parts of the country, and for the charges to differ depending on the nature of the organisation running the course? What happens if a person elects to go on a course when they are financially able to take on the payments, but then loses their job or faces some other financial crisis and no longer can afford to pay? What impact would that have on the provisions in the new clause about certificates on completion of approved courses? If someone cannot complete their attendance, they will get neither the certificate nor the discount on the period of the DBN.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Subsection (5)(d) covers monitoring the running of these courses and closing them down if it all goes wrong. Who will carry out the monitoring? Is it to be the Home Office, the local authority or some other body? To quote Alcohol Concern again, it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;It is crucial that the courses are properly evaluated for numbers of people taking them up, changes in behaviour and reductions in reoffending rates&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The sixth group covers Amendments Nos. 43 and 44. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that he agrees that a person should not suffer if a course is cancelled because of problems encountered by the supplier. He said that it is an unlikely scenario and that it has never happened without notice. I shall not go further because the noble Lord has said that this will be left to guidance. In those circumstances, he has given as full an answer as I can expect.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>In the seventh group, Amendment No. 46 seeks to delete paragraph (c). Again, the noble Lord has covered the point. The final group covers the government amendments to Clause 11. The purpose of my Amendments Nos. 58 and 59 is to make the order-making power applying to the Government&#039;s new clause subject to the affirmative procedure. Of course the Opposition always prefer the affirmative process where it is responsible to seek it because another place then has at least a chance of proper time being allocated for debate. This House has more opportunities to pray against negative resolutions, certainly more so than the other place. The noble Lord has said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has already considered this and given it a clean bill of health. We do not need the affirmative resolution procedure&quot;. While of course the committee has looked at the other clauses, I am not aware that it has had a chance to consider these new provisions. If the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_178"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord tells me that it has already done so and I have missed the report that will have been produced since the publication of these clauses last Thursday, I accept that and will have someone scurry along to the Printed Paper Office to collect it. However, I do not think that the Select Committee has yet had an opportunity to look at these specific clauses. That is the reason for tabling Amendments Nos. 58 and 59. These are welcome, interesting and certainly significant new clauses and it may be that, at least in the first instance, the affirmative procedure should be applied to the regulations governing them. If that system were applied to the first set, it might then be perfectly proper for the negative resolution procedure to apply thereafter.
</p>

<a name="60426-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Having wearied all noble Lords present, I hope that I have at least raised some pertinent questions.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As ever, the noble Baroness has been persuasive and assiduous in her contribution and I am grateful to her for the constructive way in which she has approached the amendments. If I am unable or I fail to address all the issues she has raised, I apologise in advance and will undertake to cover them between now and Report stage. They may even be picked up during a future sitting of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The first point rightly referred to was the human rights question. The noble Baroness answered herself in part. The reason why these provisions do not offend against human rights concerns is that they are voluntary in nature. It is the case that the person potentially affected by a referral to one of these courses decides for himself. In the end, it is up to him. Yes, the person may get a discount&#151;but that does not undermine ultimately the voluntary nature of the arrangement. Yes, it is an incentive&#151;I make no apology for it being anything other than that. The noble Baroness will recognise that it is a very valuable incentive to have.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="60426-11_time0"></a><h5>5.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60426-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the meaning of the term &quot;in writing or otherwise&quot;. Again she has anticipated my answer. She is right that &quot;otherwise&quot; would include Braille and audiotape as ways and means of communication. In some circumstances, where a person is challenged as to his ability to read, the instructions may be given orally so that he is able to understand them.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The noble Baroness asked who were likely to be the providers of courses. We have made it clear that we do not want to restrict the provision of courses simply to not-for-profit organisations; some commercial concerns may well provide courses which are fit for purpose. Like any other such organisations, they will have to have trained staff with the relevant experience. Our experience of the drink/drive intervention courses suggests that organisations that might be interested in providing courses would include social services, probation services, voluntary alcohol advisory services falling within a statutory remit, primary care <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_179"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

trusts and other relevant public and private sector organisations. Where appropriate, we would hope to build on the existing infrastructure of providers of the drink/drive intervention courses, which have proved to be very successful. We have been grateful in the past to Alcohol Concern and other organisations for their help and support in ensuring that we approach these courses and their construct in a practical way.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Amendment No. 39 relates to the kind of conditions that might apply to a course. It is the case that the Secretary of State will be able to approve a course, subject to specific conditions. Any conditions would apply on a case-by-case basis and would obviously depend on how course providers plan to run the courses. Such conditions may well relate to the content and operation of the courses, including how long the course will last and over what particular time period.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The noble Baroness made a very important point about the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. She is right to say that we have not yet had the opportunity to clear or receive its recommendations on the new clauses, but we are optimistic that we will. We will need to keep the noble Baroness and others involved in the debate informed as to that clearance. We expect that to be the case but, if it is not, we shall need to look at the matter again. We need to be very careful to ensure that that is the case.

</p>

<a name="60426-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I think that that deals for the most part with the questions raised by the noble Baroness. Many of the issues that have arisen will be deliberated over and considered during the construction of the guidance notes. In particular, we will have to consider the level of the fees to be charged and their impact on individuals and their changing circumstances. It is perhaps worth saying that we expect that the fees that individuals will have to pay to the course provider are unlikely to be below &#163;30 or in excess of &#163;300 per course. That is based on the experience of the work that has been undertaken with those who have been going through courses as part of the drink-driving referrals. Obviously the level of fee would depend on the length of the course. It is likely that for short drinking banning orders the courses will also be short, whereas for longer drinking banning orders the course would need to be longer, so it will be tailored to the individual concerned and the length of the order. The cost of administering the courses would be covered by the fees. Our experience suggests that the range of fees for the drink-drive intervention courses runs from about &#163;50 up to about &#163;250, so the fees in this case are likely to be broadly comparable.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>There is not much more that I can say about course providers. The Secretary of State will establish criteria for the consideration of course content. Course providers will be able to apply to the Secretary of State to run a course and it will then be for the Secretary of State to decide whether the course is appropriate or not. Regulations will set out the approval basis for courses. They will include provision for the making of applications for course approval; payment of fees and the amounts prescribed with regard to applications for approval and the giving of approval, or both; the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_180"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

maximum fees that an individual may pay for a course and when fees have to be paid; the monitoring of courses and of those people providing the courses; and details about withdrawing approved courses and making information available about courses and those persons providing courses. Those things will be set out very carefully in regulations, which means that we will have the opportunity to give those matters consideration when they come before your Lordships&#039; House. I hope that that answers the general points raised by the noble Baroness on that range of issues.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Unless I have missed anything, I am happy to leave it there. I am also happy to discuss with the noble Baroness outside the Committee points of concern relating to the detailed operation of the scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60426-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </b>   Before the noble Baroness responds, may I just say that I, too, had a briefing from Alcohol Concern on a good number of the issues that she has brought to our attention? She has saved me a lot of breath on those matters and I congratulate her on the way in which she has moved the amendments to many of the Government&#039;s proposals, which I welcome. This is a step in the right direction and puts a proper balance on the way in which the legislation is moving forward.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I was pleased to hear that an endeavour will be made to ensure that the contents of the courses will be as flexible as possible to fit in with the individual requirements of those who are affected by them. However, I have a concern. Some people will be able to meet the fees, but there may be people who will not be able to find the cash that will be required. I wonder whether we could have a look at that issue later, because provision is required to protect those people. Otherwise it looks as if they are going to be covered right the way through the period of the ban without any opportunity of getting the discount by undertaking treatment&#151;and it is treatment&#151;which is required by all, irrespective of whether they really want to get involved with it. There may be people who are debarred on the basis of the costs and we should try to find a way in which they can be covered.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I share my noble friend&#039;s view that the providers should not be limited solely to the not-for-profit agencies. Although many of those will be interested, many treatment centres in the private sector have the best interests of drug and drink abusers at heart. They will be equally well qualified&#151;if not more so&#151;to provide appropriate courses as some of the public services and they should not be ruled out. I hope that the noble Baroness will reflect on those points and perhaps not move her amendment on that matter.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Overall, this is a step in the right direction. I look forward to seeing the regulations and am content that there will be, I hope, a wide consultation before they are finally drawn together.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60426-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We on these Benches also welcome this addition to the Bill, which we think gives it a great deal more balance than it had before. The provision of treatment to people who are subject to these orders cannot but be of benefit for them.

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 181</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I am also pleased to note that subsection (8) of Amendment No. 9 requires the court to give reasons when it does not order a course of treatment. That is a very positive way of ensuring that the court gives adequate consideration to the individual circumstances of the person before it. This reflects back on my earlier amendment to seek a report from social services or other appropriate authority into the individual who is to be made the subject of the order. We are getting away from the short, sharp shock that was to be imposed without much consideration and are taking a far better approach to the problem. I congratulate the Government on taking this step.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60426-11_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I agree entirely with the spirit of what the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, said. We welcome these proposals, provided that they are effective, because this is the right way forward. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, agrees with that. We have tried to make the best of it because, once these provisions leave this House, that is it. We want to be sure that those who will be subject to drinking banning orders get the best out of the courses if they are offered them.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>We should look again at issues such as the level of fees. The Minister was very helpful in giving an indication of the range; as he said, it has to depend upon the length of time. But there is also a concern that a category of people should not be excluded. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred earlier to rough sleepers, and I would not wish to see people in a category such as that automatically excluded from being able to benefit from such an approved course. We need to think about that constructively.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that I have no intention of moving any amendment proposing that only not-for-profit organisations should set up such courses. By golly, I would be a strange Peer on these Benches if I did that. These were probing amendments to try to tease out from the Government what we might see in the guidance.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I did not hear the Minister say that the Government had consulted other organisations about these provisions. I may have missed it. Perhaps they have not had a chance to do so. I think that it would benefit debate in this House if they did so between now and Report so that we had a broader response.
</p>

<a name="60426-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I asked in Amendment No. 39 that the Secretary of State should take into account any recommendations made by persons appointed by the Secretary of State to consider the applications to run approved courses. There is a throwaway part of the clause that refers to these people, but we hear no more about them. That is the kind of thing to which I will want to return in a constructive spirit at Report, when we will be able to consider the amendments rather more cautiously and in smaller groups.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;DURATION OF DRINKING BANNING ORDERS

<br>
(1)   A drinking banning order has effect for a period specified in the order (&quot;the specified period&quot;), which must be not less than two months and not more than two years.


<br>
(2)   A drinking banning order may provide that different prohibitions contained in the order have effect for different periods; but, in each case, the period (&quot;prohibition period&quot;) must be not less than two months and not more than two years.


<br>
(3)   A drinking banning order may include provision for&#151;


<br>
(a)   the order, or


<br>
(b)   a prohibition contained in it,


<br>
to cease to have effect before the end of the specified period or the prohibition period if the subject satisfactorily completes the approved course specified in the order.


<br>
(4)   Provision under subsection (3) must fix the time at which the order or the prohibition will cease to have effect if the subject satisfactorily completes the specified approved course as whichever is the later of&#151;


<br>
(a)   the time specified in the order in accordance with subsection (5); and


<br>
(b)   the time when he does satisfactorily complete that course.


<br>
(5)   The time specified for the purposes of subsection (4)(a) must be a time after the expiry of at least half the specified period or (as the case may be) the prohibition period.


<br>
(6)   Provision under subsection (3) may be included in a drinking banning order only if&#151;


<br>
(a)   the court making the order is satisfied that a place on the specified approved course will be available for the subject; and


<br>
(b)   the subject has agreed to the inclusion of the provision in question in the order.


<br>
(7)   Before making provision under subsection (3), the court must inform the subject in ordinary language (whether in writing or otherwise) about&#151;


<br>
(a)   the effect of including the provision in the order;


<br>
(b)   what, in general terms, attendance on the course will involve if he undertakes it;


<br>
(c)   any fees he will be required to pay for the course if he undertakes it; and


<br>
(d)   when he will have to pay any such fees.


<br>
(8)   Where a court makes a drinking banning order which does not include provision under subsection (3), it must give its reasons for not including such provision in open court.


<br>
(9)   The Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (5) so as to modify the earliest time (after the completion of the specified approved course) when by virtue of that subsection&#151;


<br>
(a)   a drinking banning order, or


<br>
(b)   a prohibition contained in such an order,


<br>
may cease to have effect.&quot;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>Page 2, line 32, leave out &quot;16&quot; and insert &quot;18&quot;</p>

</p>

<a name="60426-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 15 brings us to a rather different topic. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 24, 34 and 35, which are grouped with it. They are concerned with the naming and shaming of individuals between the ages of 16 and 18 who are made the subject of these orders.
</p>

<a name="60426-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The Government have taken a robust view of naming and shaming people who are subject to ASBOs. On 1 March, the Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, calling on local authorities to name and shame, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Too many communities are still blighted by the mindless behaviour of a few yobs, who can ruin the quality of life for everyone. Many offenders think that they are untouchable and above the law. If they thought there would be a news blackout on their actions they must now think again. Publicising ASBOs has been tested in the courts and today we are making the position crystal clear&#151;your photo could be all over the local media, your local community will know who you are and breaching an ASBO could land you in prison&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I suppose that one might say of Mr Clarke that his photo is all over the media and that the community knows who is, but I shall not pursue that.
</p>

<a name="60426-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>However, an opposite view is put forward by Professor Al Aynsley-Green, who is England&#039;s first Children&#039;s Commissioner. Speaking on a Channel 4 programme in February, he said that naming and shaming is not in a child&#039;s best interests. These amendments are concerned with people between the ages of 16 and 18, who are &quot;children&quot; as defined in United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Professor Aynsley-Green said of naming and shaming:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;I&#039;m very concerned about this because it is a breach of one of the UN Conventional Rights of the Child&#039;s articles. Children have the right to privacy, and I&#039;m very alarmed when invitations are expressed through the media to get the local people to name and shame the young people, particularly children under the age of criminal responsibility&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Fortunately, the drinking banning orders are not concerned with children of that age. Professor Aynsley-Green continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;I think it affects both the older generation and the younger generation. The incessant portrayal of children as thugs and hooligans and yobs reinforces the fears that the other generation has . . . It influences political directions, it influences political policy and it certainly influences possible changes in legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>He was also concerned that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;the incessant dispersal, the incessant pressure of ASBOs are generating alienation of a generation of young people from law and authority and that can only be seriously damaging to our society in the future, if we have a generation now who are children who grow up as adults who do not respect law and order and do not respect the power of authority&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>It is all very well for the Home Secretary to say, &quot;Publish their names! Publish their photographs! Let the neighbours tell the authorities that they are in breach of this order or that order or prohibition&quot;, but the consequence, as fully outlined by the Children&#039;s Commissioner, will be the alienation of young people from authority. If that goes for ASBOs, so it will go for the new drinking banning orders. The only difference that I see is that, in the context of drinking, there may be naming, but there will be little shaming of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the person who has his photograph plastered everywhere&#151;in the present culture of drinking, it might be more a badge of honour.
</p>

<a name="60426-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Naming and shaming is not a proportionate response to youth drinking. I suggest to the Government that it will not assist the proposals for treatment courses that we have just acclaimed to have a person coming out of the place where he has taken the course to see his picture and details plastered all over the place and to have the population pointing at him. So I ask the Government to think again about 16 to 18 year-olds, which is the age group to which my amendments relate. I ask them to think again about the whole policy of naming and shaming when it comes to ASBOs, but, in particular, not to extend it to the drinking banning orders. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60426-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I will speak in support of Amendment No. 15 on the basis that I take it as a probing amendment to explore the Government&#039;s rationale for setting the age limit at which a court may make a drinking banning order at 16. It asks the Government to justify why it should be 16. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, simply raises the age to that of adulthood&#151;18. There was a useful debate on this matter in another place on 18 October, at cols. 66 to 74 of <i>Hansard</i>, but a couple of matters were not addressed then that we need to look at today.
</p>

<a name="60426-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>We on these Benches do not contest the argument that some young people under 18 drink when they should not, sometimes drink to excess and sometimes then become involved in disorder. We do not oppose the idea that help should be available to them to ensure that they do not behave in public in such a way as to cause distress or harm to other people, or indeed to cause harm to themselves. The question is whether a drinking banning order is the right way to go about forcing those under the age of 18 to change their behaviour, or whether there are other and better ways of addressing that problem. What is it about drinking banning orders that the Government believe is uniquely valuable in ensuring that young people under 18 will change their behaviour?
</p>

<a name="60426-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>In addition, we now have before us the new proposals&#151;the Government&#039;s new clauses on approved courses that we have just now agreed to have added to the Bill. What steps will the Government take to ensure that courses are available to young people under 18, and that they are specifically appropriate for young people as opposed to adults? Does the Minister agree that it would not be appropriate for the content of the course and the method of delivering it to be the same for young people under 18 as it would be for adults? What if courses are available to adults, but not available on the same geographical spread to young persons? Would that not create two different classes of people subject to drinking banning orders, with one class being at a disadvantage because they would be unable to get the chance of the discount on the length of their order?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The other matter to which I have to draw attention is that the Government seem to have a split personality when it comes to legislation regarding those under 18. Sometimes they treat them the same as adults; sometimes they recognise the fact that they are, as I would say, different from adults. We see that split personality within the Bill. In Part 1, young people are treated as adults for the purposes of drinking banning orders, yet, when we reach Part 2, suddenly young people are not treated as adults. For example, the Government seek to raise the age at which young people are permitted to buy or hire air guns from 17 to 18. I am not going to object to that; what I object to is inconsistency in the way in which the Government treat young people between 16 and 18. That is extraordinary anyway, but it is even more extraordinary that such an inconsistency should be within one Bill. That is why I hope that the Minister will address the questions that I have put today on the way in which drinking banning orders treat young people as adults.

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60426-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, concentrated his remarks on the adverse effects, as he saw them, of naming and shaming someone between 16 and 18, but his amendment, probing though it may be, seeks to ensure that no drinking banning order may be made on those below 18. Yet it seems, perhaps to many of us, that 16 to 18 year-olds are the age group most at risk of alcohol abuse, arising partly because of youth and inexperience and partly because of their not being accustomed to drink. I should have thought that a commonly held view was that there was a great risk to those individuals, let alone to the people around them whom the drunken youth might adversely affect. I am sure that the Government do not take the view that a drinking banning order is the be-all and end-all, because they have said many times that all sorts of other educative things could be done&#151;including considering the sort of advertisements that are targeted at young people&#151;to try to reduce the impact of so-called binge drinking.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I understand the point that imposing a banning order on 16 to 18 year-olds has a restrictive and negative aspect. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, fairly said, the Bill has developed from First Reading and its first printing and, when you include the educative process and the courses that have been discussed under previous amendments, you realise the protective value that making a drinking banning order against an individual who is between 16 and 18 may have. It is now clear that the negative aspect of imposing a banning order may well be combined with courses for rehabilitation, anger management and so on, so there will also be positive aspects to a banning order. Therefore, although the noble Lord concentrated on the naming and shaming aspect to a drinking banning order, there are many positive aspects. I am not at all sure about the naming and shaming aspect. I understand the points that the noble Lord made, but there are also beneficial aspects to the community and to the individuals concerned if they are held up to some form of obloquy. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_186"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

There is nothing wrong in the community feeling obloquy towards someone who is deserving of&#151;which is the hypothesis about which I am talking&#151;a drinking banning order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60426-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </b>   I do not think that the Bill is about naming and shaming. We should look for some consistency of approach in its purpose of protecting other persons from criminal or disorderly conduct while the subject is under the influence of alcohol. Those of us who have some experience of living in cities know that, like it or not, youngsters these days increasingly drink before the age of 16. Youngsters are often drunk and disorderly before they are 16 and impose themselves on the rest of the community in a variety of ways that are unacceptable. Regrettably, we have seen that in the requirement to enforce ASBOs. So there is a need for consistency in approach.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The positive side relates to the opportunities for people to opt for training. The Minister said that the contents of the courses would be flexible to meet individual needs. If youngsters create mayhem, fall foul of the community and have the orders placed on them, they would have an opportunity when they come before the court to receive training that would be tailored to meet their specific needs and could be quite different from that afforded to adults.

</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60426-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   These amendments have given rise to a useful short debate on the two issues to which they relate: the age level at which drinking banning orders should kick in, and the issue of publicity for those affected by them. I am grateful to noble Lords who contributed to the debate. I have long admired the notion that, before we make legislative changes, they should be well informed. We like to think that this legislation is the product of well informed debate and sound information on the ground.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="60426-13_time0"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60426-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I shall take the amendments in turn and deal in good measure with both sets of issues raised. Amendment No. 15 seeks to raise the minimum age at which a drinking banning order can be applied from 16 to 18. The Government&#039;s consultation paper, <i>Drinking Responsibly: The Government&#039;s Proposals</i>, published earlier this year, proposed that drinking banning orders should apply to those aged 16 or older. By setting the minimum age for an order at 16, it is intended that those drinking while underage who are involved in criminal or disorderly conduct while under the influence of drink are held to account for their conduct.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said that, although she was supporting the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, she had no particular objection to the approach that we were adopting in this but that she was looking for consistency of provision. I certainly understand the noble Baroness&#039;s point, but it is about making this fit with the reality out there. As my noble friends Lord Brooke and Lord Borrie said, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_187"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

drinking in teenagers starts rather earlier than 18, and sometimes rather earlier than 16. As a parent of teenage children, I know from my own experience that that is the case. We have to recognise what is going on in the wider society and, in particular, in our towns and cities. This set of measures is targeted very specifically at that.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The Government believe that raising the age at which an order can apply to 18 could well fail to address the real problem of underage drinking and would enable young people to escape the consequences of their actions. It fails to recognise specifically that an order may be appropriate to protect other persons from this type of conduct. I would not want us to do anything in your Lordships&#039; House that undermined the use of drinking banning orders by restricting them to those aged over 18.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>In addition, the amendment fails to recognise the evidence. As I said earlier, I am an admirer of legislation brought forward on the basis of good debate and good information, and the evidence base for this is very clear. The <i>Interim Analytical Report </i>of the Prime Minister&#039;s Strategy Unit Alcohol Harm Reduction project&#151;that is a bit of a mouthful but it is no doubt well intended for all of that&#151;suggested that those aged 16 to 24 are more likely than all other age groups to binge-drink. Our experience in towns and cities tells us exactly that. In addition, the characteristics of offenders identified in the British Crime Survey tell us that for alcohol-related assaults, offenders generally tend to be aged 16 or older. Those are additional reasons why we would not want to undermine the use of drinking banning orders by restricting them to those aged over 18. By doing so, we might well miss an important cohort of young people who would benefit greatly from the approach that we are intending to be adopted through the use of drinking banning orders.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I also take issue with another amendment&#151;Amendment No. 34&#151;tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, to which he did not refer. It would limit fines for breaches of drinking banning orders to those aged 18 and above. I cannot see the benefit of that amendment. It would mean that those aged under 18 should not be punished for breaching a drinking banning order, and I hope that other noble Lords will agree with our position on this.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 24 and 35, which would reimpose automatic reporting restrictions on proceedings for orders on conviction involving young people and when there is a breach of an order by a young person. I am well aware of the noble Lord&#039;s concerns, which were raised on Second Reading, about what he described as naming and shaming and putting up photographs of those who are subject to anti-social behaviour orders.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The Bill lifts automatic reporting restrictions on proceedings for drinking and banning orders involving young people. In proceedings brought against a young person of 16 to 17 for an order or when an order has been breached, reporting restrictions will not automatically be imposed. That will allow the press to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_188"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report cases to inform local communities of action being taken to deal with activity that blights and is a blot on many neighbourhoods.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Of course it is the case&#151;and this reassurance is important&#151;that the courts will retain discretion to apply reporting restrictions if they consider it appropriate in the circumstances. We are not creating a situation in which all cases involving young people will automatically be reported. While we are reversing the presumption, we are not preventing the courts imposing reporting restrictions when it would be appropriate to do so. I do not think that we should undermine what is after all an important form of communication and an important route of reporting action that has been taken to deal with the behaviour of individuals when it is appropriate to do so. I share the view of the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Brookman, that it is right that we in the community understand the action that has been taken in our name, so that we can identify those who cause problems in particular locations. I think that a degree of obloquy is relevant in certain circumstances, which is why we encourage publicity in some cases. Ultimately, it will be for the court to take a view on the issue.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Evidence suggests that we should have an age restriction that begins at 16 and upwards. We know from evidence that young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are more likely to be involved in binge drinking and the sort of drinking that attracts the attention of the courts and the use of drinking banning orders. We know that if we can catch the problem at an earlier stage it is much less likely to turn out to be a bigger problem as the individuals get older. If we can affect and influence young people who have a drinking problem at that age, perhaps we can save them, through the use of drinking banning orders and the conditions and prohibitions that apply, from a life that is blighted by alcohol and causes consistent concern. That is the overriding good that we seek to capture and make available to communities.
</p>

<a name="60426-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>For those reasons, I ask the noble Lord not to press his amendment. For similar reasons, I ask him not to press his later amendments, which he believes should apply and restrict the ability of the press to report on court cases involving drinking banning orders.

<a name="60426-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Across the whole breadth of the criminal law, it is a matter of public policy which is agreed to by all parties and in accordance with the covenant on the Rights of the Child, to which this country is a signatory, that we have thought it right to protect young people up to the age of 18, so that if a person is charged even with the most serious offence of murder, his identity will not be released. That is the policy that this country has adopted.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>We are now introducing a completely new concept. The breach of this civil order will lead to a criminal offence, and we are lowering the standard for this civil order.

be disorderly in a way that affects others, then you can expect your name and photograph to be published&quot;. Is it really that serious an issue that we have to go against the whole trend of public policy in this country of trying to protect young people until the age of 18? What is the reality, asked the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. We probably all have different concepts of reality. Is it really the truth that packs of 16 to 18 year-olds are going into public houses, getting drink to which they are not entitled and running riot?
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a> My own view of reality&#151;and I am fairly close to the ground in my part of the world&#151;is that it is people with a bit of money in their pocket before they take on the responsibilities of a family who are causing problems and at whom such orders should be addressed. If it is not them, it is what we have called the rough sleepers who have alcohol or drug dependence. Those are the problem people at whom the drinking banning order is directed. It is a sad day when it comes to something like disorderly conduct that all the safeguards that we have recognised, which have developed over many years, should be thrown away and young people should be pilloried in the way that the Government suggest.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a> If a young person between the ages of 16 and 18 commits an offence&#151;if he is guilty of criminal damage; if he is drinking under age; if he is drunk and disorderly; if he is urinating in a public place; if he is swearing at people&#151;he can be taken to a youth court and dealt with in that protective way that we have developed. But under this provision the principle is weakened and his protection is weakened. It is a sad day. I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions. Many good points were made against the proposition that I am advancing, which I shall consider with care. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendments Nos. 17, 25, 52, 54 and 60 make some minor and technical amendments to the provisions on drinking banning orders by removing the concept of relevant persons. The concept of relevant persons refers to those people in a relevant authority&#039;s area whom the authority is seeking to protect in applying for an order. While that definition holds for drinking banning orders made on application by a relevant authority it does not hold when a court considers making a drinking banning order on conviction. In such proceedings no relevant authority is involved.

<a name="60426-14_para6"></a>

&quot;(6)   Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 127 of the Magistrates&#039; Courts Act 1980 (c. 43) (limitation of time in respect of informations laid or complaints made in magistrates&#039; court).&quot;

<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendments Nos. 18 and 165 to the drinking banning order provisions and the new clause amending anti-social behaviour legislation respond to the uncertainties created by the Boorman case, which was decided in November last year. The amendments clarify the time period in which a complaint can be made for a drinking banning order or anti-social behaviour order. The complaint will have to be made within six months of the criminal or disorderly conduct taking place. However, earlier behaviour outside the six-month period will be relevant to support an application&#151;to show, for example, that there is a pattern of behaviour that the order is intended to address.

<a name="60426-14_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </b>   moved Amendment No. 19:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>Page 3, line 10, leave out subsection (3).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>The noble Baroness said: The intention is to probe the effect of subsection (3) of Clause 3. Clause 3 enables relevant authorities to apply to the county court for a drinking banning order against an individual in certain circumstances. Those relevant authorities are the chief officer of police, the chief constable of the British Transport Police force, and a local authority.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Where proceedings are already underway in a county court and the authorities are not involved in any way in those proceedings&#151;not a party to them&#151;subsection (3) allows those authorities to get involved just so that they can apply for a drinking banning order against one of the people who are already involved in the proceedings. In effect, subsection (3) allows relevant authorities which should not otherwise be involved to get stuck in.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Is it not the case that the majority of cases in the county court are likely to be applications for non-molestation orders in private family proceedings? Subsection (3) would therefore surely mean that the police or local authority would have the right to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

become directly involved in private family proceedings and apply for a drinking banning order against one, or perhaps both, of the parties. Is it the Government&#039;s intention that this should be the purpose of subsection (3)?
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I appreciate that private family proceedings would not immediately be a matter of public knowledge. But presumably social services, the police or probation might well have knowledge of the circumstances which gave rise to the application for a non-molestation order and therefore they would be in a position to know that the case was in the list. My concern, therefore, is that subsection (3) could give a much wider power to the police and local authorities than the Bill at first implies.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>When I tabled this amendment, I rather hoped that the Ministers would say, &quot;No, this is not what we intended, and therefore we are going to make sure that we clarify the clause&quot;. Then earlier today I listened to the responses given by the Minister to other amendments and I became concerned that perhaps the Government had an intention that I hoped they did not. When the Minister responded to Amendment No. 49, which was grouped with Amendment No. 2, he tried to convey that the Government intend that actions that take place in private at home could indeed lead to a drinking banning order being made. I am going one step further and asking whether it applies within the context of county court proceedings.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In response to Amendment No. 6, the Minister said that the Government could envisage preventing access to family. Surely the Children Act directs that the welfare of children is paramount, although the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, in replying to Amendment No. 7, said that the needs of the community are paramount.
</p>

<a name="60426-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I hope that the Minister is able to say that subsection (3) categorically rules out intervention by the state in private proceedings in non-molestation orders in the county court. If he is not able to give that assurance, I shall certainly be concerned and will want to look at the matter again on Report. If he is able to give that assurance, I shall need to know how that can be clarified in the Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her amendment. Whether what I say will actually fully answer her point I am not sure, but I will give it a go and hope that she will be mollified by my words.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I intend to explain the relevance of it in the context of where her amendment is pitched. The Bill provides for the police and local authorities, known as relevant authorities, to apply to the county court to be joined to proceedings, if they are not party to the proceedings, in order to apply for a drinking banning order. The amendment would mean that the relevant authorities would not be able to take this route to seek a drinking banning order.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>For drinking banning orders via the county court, relevant authorities can apply for a drinking banning order against an individual who is already party to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_192"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proceedings in the county court. If the relevant authority is not a party to such proceedings, it can apply to the court to be joined in order to apply for a drinking banning order. The authority can also make an application for another individual to be joined to the proceedings where that individual has engaged in criminal or disorderly conduct while under the influence of alcohol, and where that conduct is material in relation to the proceedings. For those reasons I cannot see the benefit of restricting the scope for relevant authorities to seek a drinking banning order where it is necessary to do so.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The noble Baroness specifically raised non-molestation orders and she rightly described those as being plainly domestic proceedings. She raised the issue, in essence, of the state intervening in a set of proceedings in a way which she thought was not appropriate, given what we are trying to achieve more broadly with this legislation. It would be fair to put it on record that it is not that instance that we are trying to capture by enabling these proceedings to be taken in the county court.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The best thing I can do is give an example of where we think an application might be sought through the county court for a drinking banning order. Injunctions under Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 can be made where a person has caused a public nuisance. We think that might be the sort of instance where a drinking banning order could be pursued through the county court route. I think it fair to say that we are not seeking to extend into proceedings in the county court. I well understand the noble Baroness&#039;s nervousness about us approaching other matters that county courts consider in the way in which she suggested.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I am happy to reflect further on what she said and provide her with some further reassurance outside the Chamber today. I suspect that that is important, not just for today&#039;s debate but to ensure that we can clarify the issue to her total satisfaction. I think that we have a very useful provision here. Off the top of my head, I can think of other circumstances where it might perhaps be appropriate for the local authority or the police to seek a drinking banning order through the county court. We need to provide some better clarification on that issue so that we have a common understanding of why that set of proceedings would be more appropriate.

<a name="60426-15_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister because I appreciate that he is trying to take the matter forward. I agree with him that this could be a useful provision. I am certainly not trying to prevent a useful provision being in this part of the Bill. I remain concerned that subsection (3) gives a wider power than the Government clearly intend as the current drafting would not exclude the right of a relevant authority to make an application to be joined in non-molestation cases. I really will need to reflect further on that. I am grateful to hear the Minister say that he will reflect further and, perhaps, give some assurances outside the Committee. I cannot honestly see how an assurance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_193"></a>

would be sufficient at this stage as it would leave that power within the Bill. At the moment, I cannot see myself being persuaded that that would be right.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In his answer, the noble Lord specifically said that it would be important that conduct is material to the proceedings before a relevant authority were involved. I am of course aware that, in a non-molestation order, a person&#039;s conduct while drinking may well be very relevant to those proceedings. That is why I remain concerned, but I know there is good will on the government side as there certainly is on ours. On the basis that we want to look at this before Report, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;( ) Where the court makes an order under this section pursuant to an application without notice, the individual who is subject to that order is to be served with a copy of the order personally by an officer of that court.&quot;

<p><a name="st_105"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment also stands in the name of my noble friend Lady Anelay and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. It has been tabled to question the Government on the procedure that will be used when interim orders are issued under Clause 8. In another place, the Government inserted subsection (3) during the Bill&#039;s Standing Committee stage. The subsection allows for applications to be made without notice to an individual and for hearings to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;be heard in the absence of that individual&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The new subsection caused some consternation when it was introduced and the comments made by Hazel Blears at the time in another place did little to allay those concerns. As was pointed out there, the key purpose of interim orders is to resolve a situation where speed is of the essence and where waiting for a full hearing would not be appropriate or sensible. However, it is hard to see why applications for drinking banning orders need to be made with such haste. If the situation is so critical, surely the individual would have committed a criminal offence and therefore would be in custody anyway.
</p>

<a name="60426-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>However, if the Government want to insist on leaving it as an option to the courts to hear &quot;an application without notice&quot;, our amendment tries to limit the risk of injustice to the individual by ensuring that he is served personally by the court,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;with a copy of the order&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60426-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>That seems entirely reasonable. If someone is expected to abide by prohibitions they need to know what they are. In Standing Committee B on 18 October 2005, the Minister in another place admitted as much. Moreover, she then said that she would be happy to consider the position to see whether the Government could set out the need to serve someone personally with a copy of the order. Have the Government considered this matter further? If they have decided not to set out the need to serve one personally, can the Minister explain why? I beg to move.

<a name="60426-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>  : I have indicated that I oppose Clause 8. At this stage, I should like to hear the reasons for requiring an interim order. Such orders are to last only for a limited period unless renewed. Renewal is another problem, as it looks as if they can be renewed without much difficulty. Why should it be thought necessary to make an order without notice or service and &quot;heard in the absence of the individual&quot;? What machinery do the Government have in mind for serving the order on the individual and what is the position if he breaches that order while knowing nothing about it? For example, the order may prohibit <br>&nbsp;<br>

him from entering a particular public house, which may be his local. He may go there every night for a week until someone gets around to serving this order on him. So, the reasons why an interim order is required&#151;and how the difficulties of non-service and non-appearance are dealt with&#151;are matters which I hope to have answered at this stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60426-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The court can, of course, make an interim drinking banning order if it thinks it necessary to take immediate action to stop the problems that are being caused by the criminal or disorderly conduct of an individual while under the influence of alcohol before the application for a drinking banning order can be fully determined. To be able to take action as speedily as possible is the primary reason for approaching matters through the interim drinking banning order. Subsequently, a full application would be made and considered. From memory, I think that such an application has to be made within four weeks, but I may need to be corrected on that.
</p>

<a name="60426-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Amendment No. 30 seeks to ensure that where an application for an interim order is made without notice a copy of the order is served personally on the individual by an officer of that court. That seems an entirely reasonable amendment, on the face of it. Court procedures for applying for or making an interim order would in any event be set out in magistrates&#039; courts rules, while those for the county court would be set out in civil procedure rules. There is thus no need to specify in the Bill how those orders are to be served. They are already covered in court rules, which will specify precisely how a copy of the order is to be served. For that reason, we resist the amendment.

It is my understanding that the role of justices&#039; clerks is primarily an advisory one, along with some case management responsibilities. Given the potential risk of injustice for someone to be made subject to one of these orders in their absence and without notice, it seems more appropriate that this decision be taken by the magistrates themselves rather than it being delegated to the justices&#039; clerk.

&quot;(   )   The Secretary of State must issue guidance setting out factors that the court should have regard to in determining whether applications for the renewal of orders under this section should be granted.&quot;

<p><a name="st_116"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment, standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay, relates to applications to renew interim orders. As the Bill stands, there are no limitations on the number of times for which an interim drink banning order can be renewed; nor is there any specific threshold or test set out for the granting of such a renewal, beyond the general test of whether it is just to do so, set out in Clause 8(2). That leaves it open to the courts to continue to renew interim orders without a final hearing ever taking place.
</p>

<a name="60426-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Without any specific limitations or thresholds, the applicant&#151;probably the local authority&#151;might find it convenient to invite the courts to use the renewal mechanism repeatedly rather than have a final hearing. This would in effect be an abuse of the interim order process. It would seem sensible to try to limit the use of the renewal mechanism, thus ensuring that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_197"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

onus is placed on the applicant to gather the necessary evidence and have the matter dealt with properly at a final hearing as soon as possible. It might well be that a four-week interim order is necessary to allow evidential difficulties to be overcome, but that should not be used as a cloak for inefficiency on the applicant authority&#039;s part.
</p>

<a name="60426-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>In another place, the Minister said at col. 89 of the <i>Official Report</i> of Standing Committee B on 18 October that she would &quot;consider any guidance&quot; that the Government might issue to cover this point about renewals. Is any such guidance likely to be issued? If so, what might be contained in such guidance? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60426-16_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for setting out his concerns. I agree with him: it would be wrong if a series of interim banning orders were activated at the behest of the police or the local authority in the way in which he suggests. As he says, that would be an abuse of process. I think that he said that it would be a cloak for inefficiency, which is a pretty precise description.
</p>

<a name="60426-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The amendment would require guidance to set out the factors to which the court should have regard when deciding whether applications for renewal of an interim order should be granted. I can offer this much assurance: we will produce guidance on drinking banning orders, which will have to be supplemented, where necessary, by court rules. Clearly, they will need to address that issue. I cannot tell the noble Viscount this evening exactly how we will do it, but it is on our &quot;to do&quot; list and I assure him that it is something that we will need to cover, because we want those matters to be brought before the court in an efficient and expeditious fashion.
</p>

<a name="60426-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>We do not want authorities to get into the habit of using a lazy process; we want to be as rigorous as possible. It is right that the interim process should be exactly that and that authorities are obliged fully to satisfy the court by making a proper application for a permanent drinking banning order. We will need to address that issue in the way in which I described. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60426-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   This gives me an opportunity to reply to what the Minister said earlier. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

His reply to the amendment dealing with a personal service of the order was, &quot;Well, that will go along in the usual way with the usual procedure in the county or magistrates&#039; court&quot;, yet the clause introduces new procedures. Why should it be assumed that the rules for the service of an interim order personally on an individual should follow? If the order is to be made without notice and heard in the absence of the individual, at the least the Bill should provide a requirement that the order be served.
</p>

<a name="60426-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>What happens when it is not served? What happens if it is renewed once, twice or three times and 12 or 16 weeks go by but it has not been served so the person does not know about it? Is he in breach of an order that he knows nothing about? If he is, what is the significance of that? What is the consequence of that? We need an answer to that. I do not see the utility of an interim order&#151;a drinking banning order&#151;made against someone who knows nothing about it. It is absolutely pointless until he knows something about it. It has no effect. I intend to pursue that matter. I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my earlier question: what happens if someone does not know anything about the order? What is the consequence?
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="60426-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton </b>  : The consequence is clearly that interim banning orders are there to ensure that action can be taken against a criminal offender with some speed, so that measures begin to have a bite and effect. As the noble Viscount knows, an interim drinking banning order can be made <i>in absentia</i> and the magistrates&#039; court&#151;for that matter, the county court&#151;could therefore, subject to some provisos about service, consider the complaint in the absence of the defendant. As I said, the same general position applies in the county court.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="60426-17_time0"></a><h5>6.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60426-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>However, we think it very unlikely in practice that a court would want to make a final drinking banning order in the absence of the defendant except in exceptional cases. We believe that an adjournment and the powers to issue warrants to secure attendance are much more likely in those circumstances. That probably answers the noble Lord&#039;s point, if that position were ever to be reached. The idea of an interim order is to ensure that action can be taken speedily. As I said earlier, the maximum duration of an interim drinking banning order is to be limited to four weeks and, although it can be renewed, in practice we would not want it to be renewed. We would far prefer a proper drinking banning order to be sought and made, because we think that that would properly give effect to what the police or the local authority are seeking to achieve under the drinking banning order. The permission for an application for an interim order may be given only when the court or the clerk is satisfied that the application needs to be made without the individual concerned receiving notice and without his presence. They will have to be satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances. There are sufficient <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_199"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

safeguards within that to ensure that this is a proper process and that the objectives that we seek to fulfil through the legislation are properly met.
</p>

<a name="60426-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>A drinking banning order will obviously take effect when the subject is made aware of its terms, so it makes sense to serve the drinking banning order personally and, in many cases, this can be done while the subject is in court. The need to serve drinking banning orders personally can be set out in guidance and, of course, reinforced through court rules where necessary. I understand the noble Lord&#039;s objection to this. We take a different view and we are determined that the application of this part of the Act, as it will be, is effective and can be used in a way that provides some flexibility but also ensures that the authorities are fully aware of the need to conform with the strictures that are set down on how drinking banning orders may be applied for.

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="60426-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I think I understood the Minister to say that the order does not take effect until the individual knows about it.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="60426-17_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Amendment No. 26 would require any order made by the Secretary of State under Clause 10(5) to be made by way of the draft affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure. Orders under that subsection could extend the range of persons who can prosecute for breaches of a drinking banning order, and might be used if we can expand the range of persons who can apply for drinking banning orders. I cannot be more specific than that in response to the noble Lord&#039;s point.
</p>

<a name="60426-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>It would not, in our view, be a good use of parliamentary time to require all such orders to be debated. It is entirely appropriate for an order such as this to be made by the Home Secretary and then laid before Parliament. Noble Lords can of course pray in aid against the order when it has been laid if they feel that that is right and appropriate. I also remind your Lordships&#039; House that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was content with the level of scrutiny that we propose here.

<p><a name="st_134"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment would add to the list of appropriate persons who should be consulted by a relevant authority seeking a drinking banning order under Clause 2. The amendment would add the military police authorities to the list of consultees, mainly to address the issue of garrison towns, such as Aldershot and Catterick, where the military police may be heavily involved in trying to control alcohol-fuelled disorder and may be in a better position to advise the relevant authority about the scope of any order. But it also addresses the question of whether visiting services personnel cause problems in a locality and then return to their units, or even abroad, and there may be a need to consult the military authorities to ensure that the scope of any drinking banning order is sufficient.
</p>

<a name="60426-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>It might be that the Ministry of Defence would argue that it is not the duty of the military police to provide assistance to the civilian authorities in this way and that in the vast majority of cases no service personnel would be involved and, therefore, no need to consult. As such, it is only a probing amendment, but it also raises the further question of what is the purpose of such consultation. The &quot;appropriate persons&quot; in Clause 11(1) are the relevant police forces, where the disorder occurred and where the individual resides, and the relevant local authority. If a relevant authority <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_203"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is already intending to apply for a DBO against an individual, is the point of consulting the police to gain further information on the individual and his behaviour or is it to find out from the police the effectiveness of any previous order or any future order? As such, one wonders whether consultation is necessarily the correct way to term how the local authorities and the police should be working together. It might be better to place the duty on the police to inform the relevant authority of any evidence that it has that might lead to an award of a DBO. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for addressing his amendment in the way that he has and particularly for drawing attention to the problems that might arise in what could be described as military towns. When I read the amendment I thought instantly of Colchester, which is near where I grew up. I can see that there could be circumstances in which the military police might have an interest. I then began to think about how that interest would be addressed.
</p>

<a name="60426-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The amendment provides that the senior officer of any military police unit becomes the appropriate person in an application for a drinking banning order. The implications of this are that the police, local authority or transport police, as well as consulting each other before they seek a drinking banning order against an individual, would have to consult the senior officer of any military police unit.
</p>

<a name="60426-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The police, local authority and transport police are a &quot;relevant authority&quot; and are also &quot;appropriate persons&quot;. They need to consult each other before making an application for a drinking banning order. The noble Viscount was suggesting that rather than consulting, they wish simply to inform each other. The reason why we want them to consult is that there is a need to ensure that actions taken by each agency, regarding the same individual, do not conflict. Effectively, we want them to work together, to act in concert, to understand each other&#039;s particular problems or difficulties, to understand why there is a need to apply for a drinking banning order and to understand what it will achieve in any given set of circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60426-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>As we see it, as a senior officer of any military police unit cannot apply for a drinking banning order, there is no need for him to be consulted. In our view, there is no benefit in senior officers becoming appropriate persons. We approached the MoD on this issue and it was content with the approach that we were adopting. Although I entirely understand why the noble Viscount has moved this amendment, we do not believe it adds anything. As the military police will not be the relevant authority or the appropriate persons, they do not think they need to be involved as a consultee. I have little doubt that in the military towns with which the noble Viscount and I are familiar there <br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>Page 10, line 17, after first &quot;authority&quot; insert &quot;or local authorities&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The noble Lord said: With a sense of relief, we move from drinking banning orders to alcohol disorder zones, an area which is no less contentious in all sorts of ways. The noble Lord will recall that at Second Reading we supported the basic concept behind alcohol disorder zones. It is a proper mechanism for recovering the costs of policing particular areas which cause trouble from the licensed premises that are the focus of the trouble. A number of issues are left to be determined. On the one hand, we have to determine how much those charges should be and, on the other, we have to determine whether everyone who holds a licence in a particular zone should pay. Another issue is how long those alcohol disorder zones should continue. We all recognise that there is a great temptation for a local authority to see this as an additional tax on business within the area affected.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 address the question of how much. It is suggested that instead of imposition by a local authority, it should be &quot;or local authorities&quot;, in the event that that zone falls within the area of two local authorities. More importantly, it is also suggested that the charges to be paid to the authority for each month should be limited. The amendment, which at this stage is probing, is that the charge should be at an annual rate of no greater than 3 per cent of a premises&#039; rateable value. We think it is important that businesses should not be sunk by an alcohol disorder zone. It may not assist their business to find their neighbourhood designated as such. Of course, it may be within a licensee&#039;s own hands to do something about it. But the charge on the business should not so affect the profits of that business that it cannot continue. Therefore, this is a suggestion that we put forward for the Government&#039;s consideration as a limitation on the charge.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Amendment No.65 is consequential, while Amendment No.70, which is to leave out subsection (8), deals with the payment, collection and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enforcement of charges and the determination of questions about liability. No doubt that is a matter which will be subject to further debate. For the moment, this group of amendments is concerned with maintaining a limit on the cost to business. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60426-19_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   This is indeed an important clause. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, points out, the creation of the alcohol disorder zones is a contentious matter. It means that the Secretary of State can make provision enabling a local authority to make monthly charges against licence holders in their area. Although we understand that there may be a need to make such changes in theory, we are sure it will be important to protect premises which control their own premises impeccably. Why should they have to pay for the cost of dealing with the disorder caused by others who may not even be licensees? Throughout all the debates on these issues and future groups, the main thrust of our argument will be on that issue. In the meantime, this is a very useful probing amendment. It is important to know the Government&#039;s intention on the limit of the amount that licensees might reasonably be expected to pay each month. As presently drafted, the Bill gives a wide power to impose an extra business tax, as and when a local authority pleases. We need guidance from the Government now&#151;not just printed guidance in the future&#151;about the kind of burden they think it will be reasonable for licensees to face.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="60426-19_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I agree that it is useful to debate this area, which I readily accept could be considered by some as contentious. I understand why these probing amendments have been moved. They rightly focus on the arrangements for administering the charge, which is raised under Clause 12. Amendment No. 61 would provide for the charge to be paid to &quot;local authorities&quot; in addition to a local authority. We do not see the need to make the amendment. The Bill does not enable alcohol disorder zones to straddle local authority boundaries. But it has to be recognised, and it would be quite right, that two adjacent local authorities designate areas as alcohol disorder zones where those areas are contiguous to each other. In that situation, each local authority would collect charges from the premises in its area; for example, in cases where there is a night-time economy centre which straddles two local authority areas, as is likely in many of our towns and cities. If the amendment was aimed at areas where there are two-tier authorities, then again we think the amendment is unnecessary. If the county council provides additional services to an alcohol disorder zone, the local authority would designate the alcohol disorder zone and collect the charge and pay a proportion on it accordingly. However, as has been well trailed before this discussion, this is an issue on which I can offer assurance. The assurance is that those situations will be covered in the guidance on alcohol disorder zones. I think it is right that they are, because there will need to be some detail within those guidance notes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_207"></a>

</p>

<a name="60426-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Amendment No.62 would insert a cap on the level of the compulsory charge in an alcohol disorder zone. The amendment would set that at the monthly equivalent of 3 per cent of premises&#039; annual rateable value. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the issue of a cap on the compulsory charge in an alcohol disorder zone. I think that he mentioned at Second Reading the matter of when it was discussed in another place and my right honourable friend Hazel Blears, the Minister of State, undertook to consider the matter further.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The noble Lord touched on a number of issues. The charge needs to be set at a meaningful level which is sufficient to recoup local agencies&#039; costs in mounting effective enforcement interventions based on what is required to properly reduce crime and disorder in any given locality. At the same time we take the view that the charge needs to be enforceable and payable. We are not about the business of setting charges at a level which forces people to cease trading. We do not want the charge to act as a disincentive to business formation and to those who are in the business of providing the services of a pub, a club, an off-licence and so on. We firmly take the view that the charge needs to reflect the last-resort nature of alcohol disorder zones and help incentivise local action. We need to bear in mind the relative costs of the type of excellent voluntary arrangements currently in place in some areas, which were helpfully referred to at Second Reading. Having considered this, we believe that we should not put a cap on the charge on the face of the Bill. I do not believe that a cap, arbitrarily set, will deliver what we are looking for here. However, when we debate the regulations, we will need to ensure that we build in sufficient flexibility to enable them to meet local requirements. We will nevertheless need to provide checks and balances to meet what is intended.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I understand the concern. I do not know whether setting the charge at 3 per cent of annual rateable value is right. I am not sure whether the noble Lord thinks it is absolutely right. But there could be a problem if we set a level in legislation. We need flexibility. That is where I think secondary legislation has a value, not least because it means that between now and then we can talk to the local authorities and to the trade and get it right. The important thing is that we get the principles right, that it does not act as a disincentive, and that it acts as an encouragement to get collective action at work&#151;in most cases short of alcohol disorder zones&#151;in areas where there is a commonly perceived problem with unruliness and disorderly behaviour.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Amendment No. 65 would strengthen the link between those rates of charges and the charging power at subsection (1). Again, this is not an amendment that we think is necessary. It is very clear that Clause 12 deals with regulations for the power to impose charges in alcohol disorder zones.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Amendment No. 70, which would remove subsection (8) from Clause 12, provides that the Secretary of State may simply make regulations about the payment, collection, enforcement, liability and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appeals concerning the charge. I am slightly puzzled by the amendment because I do not see how it would confer any benefit other than to leave a considerable gap in the scope of the regulations without trying to compensate for it anywhere else in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>While we accept that this is an important debate, we do not think it appropriate to deal with the detail in the Bill itself. It is right that we should consult further and fine-tune the detail so that we end up with a charging regime that reflects the importance of recouping local agency costs, encourages participation in all actions which fall short of creating an alcohol disorder zone and acknowledges the fact that such zones are in essence a measure of last resort designed to encourage collective action against a commonly perceived problem with alcohol-related disorder.
</p>

<a name="60426-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>For the reasons I have gone through in my response, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="60426-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, from which I take two particular points. First, as I understand it, the Government accept the principle of a cap on these charges.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60426-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I cannot concede the principle of a cap, although I recognise the importance of the issue. I want to make that clear. The problem with a cap is that it is an arbitrary notion. I can see why the noble Lord has moved the amendment as he has, but I have sought to make it very clear that we will have to ensure that the charges are set sensitively and fine-tuned so as to achieve our common objectives. As the noble Lord said, he supports in principle the concept of alcohol disorder zones. He has also quite rightly raised his concerns, some of which I am sure reflect a degree of nervousness outside about the practical implementation of the scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60426-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I think that that nervousness will remain after the noble Lord&#039;s last reply. I wonder whether he and his officials could give some thought to how to give an assurance that the charges will not simply go sky high and that some control will be exercised over the level of charges. As he said, I am not wedded to any particular percentage of the annual rateable value; all I seek to suggest is to introduce a mechanism that introduces a form of control, even if the word &quot;cap&quot; is not acceptable.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>The second thing I took from the Minister&#039;s reply is that it is not the wish of the Government to put people out of business. I am sure that when these charges are considered and calculated, the costs to a particular business of taking appropriate measures to deal with the problem will also be taken into account. It cannot be cost free to have to deal with disorder in a particular zone; otherwise no charges would be imposed. So there is a double burden of charges in the form of the charge payable to the local authority and a charge for the actual measures that the licensee wishes to take. If those are allowed to go out of control, the Government will have the undesirable consequence of businesses <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_209"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ceasing to trade. As a result, an area would become not just an alcohol disorder zone but a desert where you cannot get a drink. No doubt that would be even worse.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Perhaps the Minister will be able to think of a mechanism by which the charges can be controlled. I see that he is indicating his assent. On that basis I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>Page 10, line 24, leave out &quot;may&quot; and insert &quot;shall&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment would remove the discretion afforded to the Secretary of State to make provision by regulations requiring local authorities to use any money raised by alcohol disorder zone charges for set purposes. It would be mandatory for such regulations to be issued.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>It seems odd that this discretion has been left in the Bill. Surely the money raised by a local authority from these charges should be used to address the problems caused by alcohol disorder and not for any other purpose entirely unconnected with alcohol disorder. In theory it would still be open to the Secretary of State to specify the &quot;other purposes&quot; unrelated to alcohol disorder prevention, but if that is the case the Secretary of State should be the one to justify that policy decision. If what to do with the money is left to the discretion of local authorities, small and medium-sized town centre businesses may understandably feel that they are at risk of being subject to a tax that will raise income for local authorities to do with as they please rather than making a contribution to remedying an identified and specific problem. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="60426-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I recognise that the amendment would strengthen the wording in Clause 12 and have the effect of requiring the Secretary of State to specify in regulations exactly what services the moneys raised by the compulsory charge can be spent on. I see where the noble Baroness is coming from with this amendment. We also want to ensure that the money raised goes to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder, but the amendment is not necessary. The regulations will need to include the range of interventions covered by the charge and we can offer an assurance on that. The guidance will also cover the interventions which should be deployed. I do not doubt that those subjects will be covered in discussions with the police and local government associations. I also do not doubt that the associations will want to offer encouragement to their authorities on what is to be considered as best practice. We think that that approach will work best.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The noble Baroness is right to be wary of local authorities going off on a frolic of their own. We certainly do not want to see that. I understand from my political background that that can happen from time to time. But we are aiming for practical and hard-nosed measures. If we reach a point where there is an <br>&nbsp;<br>

alcohol-related crime and disorder problem in an area and it is necessary to put in place an alcohol disorder zone, by that stage exactly what is required will probably be understood by the local authority, the police and in all probability by many of the local businesses&#151;in particular those in the trade of selling alcohol. The measures will focus on the particular needs of the community concerned.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I understand the point being made in the amendment. We are at one with the noble Baroness in her objective, but this issue will be covered in regulations, guidance and no doubt, as I said, by best practice as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="60426-20_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   In one respect I am grateful to the noble Lord because he recognises that we have the same objective here. He has offered an assurance about what will be set out in the regulations; that is, to ensure that moneys raised are used for the specific purpose of addressing disorder linked to the need to create an alcohol disorder zone. He also made the point that my drafting would strengthen what is in the Bill. However, we are talking about two different things. The noble Lord&#039;s assurance is made with regard to the content of the regulations. My amendment would ensure that the regulations are issued.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I am acutely aware of a conversation I had earlier today with my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon, who yesterday in the course of discussions on another Bill was somewhat frustrated when she found that continual reference was made to regulations and guidance. The Opposition are a little frustrated by a series of Bills in which much is being left to regulations. I note that we have been considering the Bill for around three and a half hours now. As I forecast earlier, the words &quot;regulations and guidance&quot; have formed a substantial part of our vocabulary.
</p>

<a name="60426-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>I am disappointed that we have reached this stage and I still do not feel that the Government have given us detailed information on how the drinking banning orders and alcohol disorder zones are to be implemented. On that basis&#151;and only on that basis&#151;I feel that I must now make my little protest, stamp my feet and say that I should like to test the opinion of the Committee.

<a name="60426-21_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Local Government (Boundaries) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006</h3>

<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="60426-21_time0"></a><h5>7.21 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="60426-21_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker) </b>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 22 March be approved [<i>Considered in Grand Committee on 18 April</i>].
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that this House consider the Local Government (Boundaries) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, a draft of which was laid before the House on 22 March. The Grand Committee considered the order in some detail on 18 April.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I will be brief and reserve my longer remarks to when I answer points in the debate. The purpose of the draft Local Government (Boundaries) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 is to set the context for a review of local government boundaries in Northern Ireland. It will enable the number of local government districts to be reduced from 26 to seven. The new districts will be the starting point for the review of local government boundaries. The order also provides for the appointment of a local government boundaries commissioner. This is an important measure to bring local government arrangements in Northern Ireland into the 21st century, and forms a major step in the Government&#039;s programme to modernise and reform central and local government in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The reorganisation will result in a smaller number of councils but much stronger local government, with a greater role, a greater list of enhanced functions, significant streamlining of local public services and, we believe, better value for money for the ratepayers and taxpayers of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The order introduces the seven new local government districts by reference to the current 26. It sets out how the seven are constructed and provides for those districts to be divided into wards. There is a requirement to appoint a local government boundaries commissioner, who will recommend the final boundaries, the names of the seven districts and the number, boundaries and names of the wards into <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_213"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which each district is to be divided. The order also introduces a provision setting out the functions of the commissioner and providing for him to submit his final report within such a period as the department may direct.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The order also sets out the rules in accordance with which the commissioner should make his recommendations and, in particular, provides that a local government district should be divided into 60 wards. The commissioner shall have some flexibility to divide a district into between 55 and 65 wards, if he considers it desirable, taking into account the size, population and physical diversity of the district, and the representation of the rural and urban electorates within the district. The commissioner shall regulate his procedures and make his recommendations as specified in a new Schedule 4 to the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>This matter is being consulted on in Northern Ireland over a substantial period of time. The whole issue was started by the Assembly when it was sitting. The decision that the Government finally reached followed consultation, the majority of responses to which supported the Government&#039;s view on seven councils. It is true that the political class of Northern Ireland did not do that, but this is not constructed to suit the political class of Northern Ireland; it is designed to suit the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 22 March be approved [<i>Considered in Grand Committee on 18 April</i>].&#151;(<i>Lord Rooker</i>.)
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60426-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton </b>   rose to move, as an amendment to the Motion, at end to insert &quot;but this House regrets that the arrangements proposed for seven councils will not provide sufficient local identity, engagement, accountability for decisions or accessibility of the public to political representatives, as expressed by the majority of parties in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Local Government Association&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing this order. He set the tone when he said that this was done not for the political class of Northern Ireland but for the people. That is an interesting concept, divorcing the people from their elected representatives.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>We welcome the overall aim of refurbishing the system of local government in Northern Ireland and adding to its powers&#151;and, among other considerations, there is a clear need to strengthen the powers and responsibilities of local authorities and to cull the numbers from the existing 26 local councils. The problem is that the proposed reduction to only seven authorities is far too drastic. The figure of seven is opposed by all the political parties except Sinn Fein, as well as by the Northern Ireland Local Government Association.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The Government have proposed to create seven unwieldy super-authorities, covering vast tracts of territory. Those authorities will be far too remote from the citizenry and far too inaccessible to them. In Grand Committee, both the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, and the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Lord, Lord Lyell, questioned the sheer impracticability of the size of the authorities, which will artificially seek to embrace very disparate sets of communities.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>As I said in Grand Committee, when one is contriving to devise a democratic system of local government, much depends on getting the balance right between the two competing principles of, on the one hand, facilitating public participation and accountability and, on the other, efficiency and the management and administration. These two operational principles are inherently opposed to each other and the trick in a democracy is to manage that tension effectively.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>This order, with its proposal for only seven councils, fails lamentably to do that. The Government have decided to elevate the quest for efficiency way above a concern for nurturing public participation and civic pride. The Minister gave the game away in Grand Committee when he cited, somewhat desperately, the support of the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the chambers of commerce and the General Consumer Council, among others. As I later commented, unlike political parties, all of which, bar one, oppose the reduction to seven, these pressure groups have never been known to promote local democracy&#151;it is not part of their core business. Indeed, from their perspective, they would probably prefer just one single authority, which would make it so much more convenient when tendering for contracts. With respect, the noble Lord&#039;s response to my point did not convince me.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>It would have been better to have gone for between 10 and 15 councils. That number would have been much more conducive to fostering a sense of belonging and would have helped to create a sense of identity. The vast swathes of land that each of the seven councils will cover will make democratic political activity difficult to sustain. Evening meetings will necessarily be convened in what are for many councillors remote centres, which will make attendance extremely difficult, especially in winter.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>What sort of person will be able to contemplate standing for election? Will the councils be sequestrating school buses to make circuitous journeys to gather up far-flung councillors? What are the Government&#039;s proposals for facilitating communications? These, and similar consequences, have not been given a moment&#039;s thought. E-mails, phone calls and other modern telecommunications may well serve for global business, but they are poor proxies for face-to-face human interaction, which will be severely reduced by the excessively geographically large councils that this order creates.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Finally, I have a more general point. This sort of constitutional reform should have been dealt with by primary legislation. A Bill can be amended; an order can only be rejected <i>in toto</i> or regretted, which is the approach I am having recourse to this evening. This is a poor substitute for democratic scrutiny but it is all of a piece with the Government&#039;s policy of truncating the operation of democracy wherever possible. I beg to move.

7.30 pm
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="60426-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Glentoran </b>  : My Lords, I thank the Minister for bringing forward this order. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, for giving us the opportunity to debate his amendment. As far as I and my party are concerned, the most relevant point made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, was the last one. This is an extremely difficult subject; reorganisation of local government, as I said in Committee, has been close to my heart ever since I have had the privilege of being in your Lordships&#039; House and spokesman for Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition. I am absolutely certain that reorganisation is right; I am less certain&#151;even my party and I do not agree to the nearest digit&#151;about the ideal number of local authorities. Inevitably but sadly, we are in the strange, very undemocratic situation, in which the Government bring forward a number that nobody likes very much and we have only two alternatives. One is to say no and try to vote it out, which I think is absolutely wrong; the other is to accept what the Government say, which is also probably absolutely wrong.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I know that the Minister agrees with me that these decisions should be made by the Assembly and by the people of Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, this is not possible because the Assembly is not sitting. I would very much have preferred&#151;and it is an easy emotional wish&#151;the Government to have refrained from introducing the order until such time as the Assembly was back and in some position to give us in this House a guide on where their views really lay. Unfortunately, that is not the position; although we and the Government can say that when the Assembly settles down to work, they can change it, we know that it will never succeed in changing it because that will need cross-party support. The complications of the voting system, with the d&#039;Hondt agreements and so on, will prevent this change from ever taking place.
</p>

<a name="60426-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I do not believe that Sinn Fein will move from its position of wanting six or seven councils or that the unionist parties will move from their position of wanting 10 to 15. There will never be agreement on this in the Assembly in Northern Ireland, and that is very sad. Maybe it will reach agreement on a different number from that which the Minister is putting forward today. Pigs might fly. But I would rather see the reorganisation of local government getting under way now or in the very near future than let it go completely into some dustbin to be resurrected God knows when in the future when the Assembly in Belfast is able to act and legislate on it.

<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="60426-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   My Lords, suppose local government in England was to be fundamentally <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_216"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reformed. Would the Government even contemplate doing so by Order in Council, or would the political parties and the electorate here expect a proper Bill that could be debated, amended and put to a vote as that Bill moved from stage to stage?
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I honestly regret having to evaluate this Order in Council as a deliberately perverse and bad piece of legislation designed to meet only the sectarian demands of the most intransigent elements of Sinn Fein and unable to be justified on any reasonable grounds. Would Secretary of State Hain accept local government for Wales on the basis of tenuous support from only one minority party? Of course not and neither is it a sensible or practical basis for what Northern Ireland needs in terms of local government reform.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>This is punitive legislation designed to bully the majority of citizens because their elected representatives have failed to sustain a devolved Assembly. That has happened because the Provisional IRA, or Sinn Fein, is in that Assembly while still engaged in every conceivable form of criminality. Many feel that to work to that baseline means that Northern Ireland is being surrendered to corrupt elements by a Secretary of State who refuses to listen to us.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>For many it is the choice between a rock and a hard place. While I may be at variance with those who lack the courage to face up to the lesser of two evils and get back to having an Assembly, I understand and respect their position. I fought terrorism and then, for almost a quarter of a century, I sat with terrorists and their frontmen in local government. They never outgunned me on the ground and they never outgunned me in the democratic Chamber. That is why I would be back at Stormont. It would be a hard and risky road but so much better than this, because ever since we endorsed the Belfast agreement as a basis for transition from outright terrorism to democratic structures, a malleable government have betrayed us. They have consistently made impassable any pathway to normality that would facilitate unionists&#039; rights and traditions. On another occasion I may have time to articulate the full extent of that betrayal. For now, I simply ask colleagues in this House, against the background that I have just defined, to evaluate this legislation.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The critical issue here is the proposal to establish a seven-council arrangement to replace the current 26-council structure. Ulster Unionists wanted significant change. They would have preferred 15 councils&#151;a local authority coterminous with each parliamentary constituency, with the four Belfast constituencies coming together and with constituency boundaries already accepted by the public and parties alike. If pressed, we might have settled for 11. But the seven-council structure proposed will give militant Sinn Fein absolute control over a greater geographical half of Northern Ireland. It will inevitably create a Balkan-type structure that will be untenable for unionists in that part, and I greatly fear that the reciprocal could also happen. Why would any Government want to risk that?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_217"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Does the Minister really believe that these changes are not intended to focus large swathes of Northern Ireland towards a southern Irish aspect? He is wrong. That is exactly what some intend. The uncertainty and inevitable resentment that the Government are about to unleash fills me with dread for the future.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>If the Government had been sincere, would we not by now have heard the basis on which the first change in local government in Northern Ireland for 33 years was predicated? Is it not an issue worth proper debate in a proper Bill? But no. After 33 violent years, Northern Ireland is being presented with another diktat: take it or leave it. Let us just remember what happened to the 1985 diktat, and be warned.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>What infrastructural audit has been carried out? Council staff will have to have working accommodation and, since the Minister told us in Committee that he has no new money, one must assume that existing facilities will be utilised. Twenty-six existing council headquarters will somehow have to accommodate seven new councils. We can envisage the organisational and communication chaos. But no one has a blueprint on how it is intended that this will be resolved.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>What detailed financial audit has been carried out? None, if that can be believed. But is the Northern Ireland Office not good at off-the-cuff estimates? In answer to my specific Written Questions, has it not confessed that that is the methodology by which it is intent on destroying&#151;in fairness, I think that it said &quot;reforming&quot;&#151;our grammar and secondary schools sector of education? That matter, vital to the future of our children, is also to be dealt with by Order in Council. No&#151;we are not to be allowed to participate in that game either.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>To go back to finance, local government in Northern Ireland accounts at present for only 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent of total public expenditure. After these changes, that will rise to less than 10 per cent. All this talk about efficiency is nonsense. The real spending is done by quangos and that will continue with only a few minor changes. Let us not even mention consultants who are employed to put a gloss on government&#039;s indiscretion. Government just hit on a ball-park number and fill in the details later. What a way to run a business.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Of course, we are told that such eminent bodies as the Institute of Directors have backed the seven-council proposal. I have been in local government for almost 20 years, and I have never known the Institute of Directors and all those other noble bodies to interface with local government on either a regular or a casual basis. We really ought to wonder why the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Alliance Party oppose a seven-council arrangement. Will the Minister tell us whether the more progressive elements of Sinn Fein are actually in favour of this seven-council proposal? This might just be like the Government&#039;s &quot;on the run&quot; fiasco and not quite what Sinn Fein wants.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Is it not relevant that the Northern Ireland Local Government Authority representing all political parties, opposed seven councils? And is not the Society <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_218"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers, or SOLACE, working agreeably in partnership with NILGA on the basis of its position? The Government have no real clothes on this issue and are operating against the expressed wishes of all those bodies and a clear majority of the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I conclude by referring to issues that concern the Government&#039;s own local government watchdog, the Local Government Staff Commission, to which it has not had answers. Those issues relate to the human rights aspects of the review of public administration. We are not debating them specifically here, but, I promise, they are inextricably linked.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>What specific proposals have the Government made concerning the transfer of staff between the present councils and the new establishment, and from the Civil Service into the new establishment? Have the Government even the remotest idea how they plan to populate the new council with staff from two sources&#151;those moving from within local government and those transferring from the Civil Service, quangos and agencies? How will they deal with displaced staff and, taking into consideration Section 75 and New TSN, how will the location of new councils be decided?
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>I could continue but, as the Government have not thought through their tactics and as they do not really have a strategy that relates specifically to the issue before us, where is the point? I will bet a pound to a penny that the simple issue of the recruitment and interviewing of chief executives, for example, is not thought through. Will recruitment be a ring-fenced process or will it be done by public advertisement?
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>This order is a travesty. I regret that this House has not been able to take the ultimate punitive action on this matter. It is time that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland stopped to listen. It is time that he stopped digging up the cricket pitch on which the game of peace and democracy is to be played out.

However, the debate in Grand Committee provided a useful quarry for questions on the controversial decision that Her Majesty&#039;s Government have made which is incorporated in this order. In the Minister&#039;s final sentence before he moved the order in Grand Committee on 18 April, he said at col. 442 that there was far more background than he had given in his short introduction to the order, so I do not apologise for asking some more questions. I realise that they may have been answered in the letter which he sent to us all, but which I did not see before Grand Committee. I have just spent two days in the Republic with the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and therefore do not have the letter about my person.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>We have to ask the questions because the Minister was confronted by one party in Northern Ireland asking for seven councils while the other parties asked <br>&nbsp;<br>

for 15. Given the judgments of Solomon which all Northern Ireland Ministers from Great Britain have to make in Northern Ireland affairs, there have to be good reasons why the Minister, unlike Solomon, did not split the difference at 11. My first questions are devoted to the background to the elimination of 11 as a solution, especially when it was vouchsafed in the Explanatory Notes that 71 per cent of those who had expressed an opinion in response to the second consultation had voted for 11 or fewer.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The Government have laid much stress on these percentages, but they look a little threadbare when it transpired from the Minister&#039;s reply to the Grand Committee debate that only 113 of 1,032 consultees who responded to the second consultation had expressed an optimal preference for any of the three choices of seven, 11 or 15 councils which the Government had offered them. That leaves 919 responders who made no choice at all. That imbalance somewhat reduces the significance of the percentages. Moreover, the Minister, in explaining why it was wrong to add up all the three percentage figures which the Explanatory Notes had a little ambiguously afforded, never explained why, on his exegesis, another 11 per cent, as identified by my noble friend Lord Glentoran, were left over, as the Minister&#039;s percentages as defined in Grand Committee add up to only 89. It is not for me to teach my grandmother to suck eggs, but as a Northern Ireland Minister I would not have the calculations so opaque on a politically highly sensitive subject. I am sure that there is a good explanation, but it would have been even better if it had been initially and immediately transparent. As to the 919 consultees who had no opinion, I wonder what their opinions would have been if they had been required to give one.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>However, I appreciate that the Minister&#039;s determination of seven councils did not depend entirely on the percentages. His decision depended also on the spread of wealth. He said in Grand Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;To get as even a spread of wealth as possible, on a property basis, of the seven councils was therefore an aim&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>He went on to say in the next sentence:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;Seven councils deliver that better than any of the other options that were looked at&#151;the 11 and the 15&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18/4/06; col. GC 456.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>I remark neutrally that that is an odd order in which to utter those two sentences. I would logically have uttered them the other way round. Was the Minister really saying that there was no way in which you could have configured 11 councils, which I acknowledge has potential geographical complications, which would not have produced an even spread, around 9 per cent, of Northern Ireland&#039;s property wealth?
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Let us however give him the benefit of the doubt on that&#151;I assume that that is what he was saying&#151;and assume that seven councils offered a better chance and more potential options in terms of configurations. He said that his aim was to get as even a spread of wealth as possible, on a property basis, for those seven councils. A precisely even spread would have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_220"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been 14.29 per cent of Northern Ireland&#039;s property wealth per council, but even with the geographical complications, you could logically have achieved that or something like it from more than one permutation of the present 26 district councils, especially as you are not obliged to follow their boundaries absolutely precisely. What maximum deviation from 14.29 per cent did the Minister allow his officials in making their recommendations? In the event, what is the difference between the poorest and the richest potential council in the distribution of the 26 councils that he prescribes in Article 3 of the order? What is the difference between the poorest and the richest in the second-best option in the distribution of the 26 councils?
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I realise that I am asking these questions at a late stage in the process, though I can plead that I have been participating in eight other Bills so far this year. I make no apology for the questions, because the Minister, who is a thorough Minister, will have asked his officials those questions himself, given the discrepancy in preferences expressed by the political parties. But, given the real hazards of Balkanisation and the alienation that results, which have significance for the people of Northern Ireland and not just for the political classes, he has a responsibility to be fair. He must forgive us if some of us recall how spectacularly wrong the Government were in their expectations of the outcome of another piece of regional paving legislation in England in which he participated. It led to a referendum on November 4 two or three years ago whose result was known in Whitehall for several months thereafter as &quot;4/11&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Finally, am I correct in assuming&#151;here I follow up on my noble friend Lord Glentoran&#151;that if this order goes through tonight there will be no opportunity after 15 May, assuming other legislation goes through next week, for the Assembly to give the Government the benefit of its views?

<a name="60426-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I wish to place on record my great support for my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton in his amendment to this order. As we have already heard, the Local Government Association of Northern Ireland and the majority of Northern Ireland parties are against the order. Notwithstanding what the Minister said at the beginning, these are the people who talk to the general populace of Northern Ireland. That is an important point to make.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I too understand the importance of reducing the size of local government. I think we all do. It is too big at the moment. However, the reduction to seven councils is just too small. As we have also heard, this is a serious constitutional matter. Doing this through secondary legislation gives us no real opportunity to change it in any way at all. Coming here tonight and discussing the opportunity of reducing the number from what it is at present to what we would prefer, which is 15, is all we can do. It is deeply disturbing.

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Mark Durkan, speaking in another place earlier today, referred to the Balkanisation of Northern Ireland. I have already heard that tonight from a number of noble Lords, graphically from the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, referred to it as well. At the meetings of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body yesterday and on Monday in Killarney, we heard how communities are being polarised. This can lead only to an exacerbation of that. It is a deeply worrying state of affairs. This order would create great harm in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>This crucial legislation should be decided by the people of Northern Ireland, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said. I simply do not understand the rush to complete it so quickly. Why could this not wait until the November deadline set out by the Secretary of State? Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the urgency of completing this so quickly is about.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Noble Lords have addressed the constitution of local government. Local government should be close to the people it represents. It should not be so huge that it becomes remote. That is especially important in Northern Ireland, where sensitivities are so very fragile and the need for trust and closer working within and between communities is crucial to ensure harmonious working. Enormous councils will not do anything to bring the communities together. I remember when the Government were trying to regionalise England. This is like trying to regionalise England, and look what happened there.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>I was a local councillor for 25 very happy years. I lived in a very rural area of North Yorkshire, and local councillors in my district, which was the main one for delivering services, came from great swathes away in the dales of the county. It was impossible for some of them to get down to meetings in the winter, and I worry, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, said earlier, that the size of the councils can be far too great to enable people to get to the heart of their local communities quickly.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Councillors need to know their areas and wards intimately. There is a great danger if the councils are too large. What matters to people is the interest in purely local matters. That will vanish, because it will only be strategic decisions that councillors will consider they have to take.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Finally, I would argue that reducing to such a low number as seven from 26 is a step too far, too soon and too disruptive. I urge the Government to take great heed of my noble friend&#039;s Motion.

<a name="60426-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>This order provides the backbone to the first major review of local government boundaries in Northern Ireland since 1972. While neither I nor the Ulster Unionist Party oppose such a review, we do indeed oppose the rushed nature of this legislation and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government&#039;s attitude towards consultation, as well as the unacceptable lack of scrutiny afforded by this Order in Council procedure. For such a fundamental change in the organisation and machinery of local government, a more in-depth and thorough legislative process should have been utilised, with adequate time allocation for debate and indeed amendment, even if the implications of denying the people of Northern Ireland a role are ignored by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>A further point to note relates to consultation. It appears pointless to me even to consult on such a fundamentally important change in the local government landscape, if, even when the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, the organisation that represents local government councillors in Northern Ireland, believes there ought to be 15 local authorities, and the Ulster Unionist, Social Democratic and Labour, Democratic Unionist and Alliance parties oppose the Government&#039;s proposals for seven local authorities, the Government are still content to push through such weak proposals with the dubious support of just Sinn Fein/IRA.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, mentioned, this harks back to the same situation we found ourselves in with the ill-fated on-the-runs legislation. One can only hope this order suffers a similar fate. It carries no public support and the political support of one party. Furthermore, it is a matter that should be considered and, most importantly, scrutinised by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>I find it incredible that this order is coming from a Government who only a short time ago issued a statement in which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland declared that,

</p>

<a name="60426-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Moving on from the bigger picture and problems of accountability and scrutiny, this order, on a more specific level, is running a considerably dangerous risk which will have damaging and long-lasting implications for the future of local government. The order is concerned with setting up seven super-councils, which will lead to the boundaries being more crudely drawn than if we adopted the 15-council or even the 11-council model. In my view the order is providing the perfect foundation for the Balkanisation of Northern Ireland, which will result in an imbalanced and factionalised political landscape. Is this not the one thing that we should be seeking to avoid at all costs, not least for the future generations of the people of Northern Ireland?
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>We are all concerned with the efficiency of local government and the fundamental importance of delivering effective and engaging services to the communities that are represented, but these services will simply flounder if there is not true cross-community power sharing, on all the rungs of the democratic ladder.

</p>

<a name="60426-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I have sought to raise a few of my concerns with this order and I conclude with the important fact that I, and indeed, the main political parties in Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland, are not opposed to reform of local government. But this order is not a reforming measure. As the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, said, it is rushed legislation. It is a crudely drawn gesture to appease Sinn Fein/IRA and would be exposed as such if it were properly debated and scrutinised in the appropriate domain; namely, the Northern Ireland Assembly.

<a name="60426-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for noble Lords&#039; contributions, one of which may have been marginally&#151;slightly&#151;in favour of the Government&#039;s proposals. That means that the debate was not much different from Grand Committee. I shall do my best to answer the points that have been made.
</p>

<a name="60426-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>In terms of the detailed questions, particularly those that were rightly put by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, I can do no better than to suggest that he look at the second consultation document, published last March in relation to the six-month consultation. There had already been a two-year consultation on the issue, set up by the Assembly. There is an interesting aspect of the chapter on the evenness of the rating base. Lots of configurations involving the existing councils were looked at&#151;a couple of dozen variations of between five and 16 local government areas, using the exiting local government districts. A sample of more than 30,000 house sales over two years, reflecting the market, was also used as the basis for the analysis. As described in the document, that configuration of seven and eight new council areas presented the best options for an even distribution of the underlying property base. When all 25 configurations were ranked on evenness or spread of wealth, those with 10 or fewer were better than those with more than 10. The report goes on to indicate the other aspects that were looked at in terms of the national geography and the cohesiveness of the communities. As I said, this document was published last March, presenting the seven, 11, and 15 options. But it was not a case of seven, take it or leave it. There were three examples of seven, three examples of 11 and three examples of 15 even in the document published last March. That was the kind of configuration.

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The suggestion that this was done on the back of an envelope&#151;though I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, was saying that&#151;is not true. Initially, several thousand configurations were looked at by the researchers, whose research was published on the web early last year. None of that research, to the best of my information, has been challenged, and I have just had it confirmed. They were trying to find the most even options. I am not saying that the wealth base is the be all and end all, but it was a major factor in examining how one constructs a local government structure, because other factors were taken into account.

The fact remains that it is not just the seven councils; it is how the seven councils are put together that actually affects the political issue that some of us were talking about.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60426-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Yes, my Lords, that is what I said. Even the document published last March contained more than one seven-council option. That was how this was configured and further consultation work was done throughout the summer. If I do not have, as I hope, a specific answer to the noble Lord, I shall do my best to provide one. As I say, the research was published; it was not just this document. The background research that went into this was published and none of it has been challenged. More than one seven-council option was up for grabs in the document. As I said in Grand Committee, as part of this order, the boundary commissioner&#039;s ability to look at the configuration of the construction of the seven councils out of the 26 gives him discretion to alter the external boundaries to take account of where some communities in a seven-council model would naturally fit in another local authority area, rather than where they are now. The facility for the boundary commissioner is in this order.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I shall do my best to answer some of the more detailed points that have been made. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, pooh-poohed many of the bodies that contributed. I fully accept that many consultation documents were sent out. There were more than 113 responses, but 113 expressed a preference for a number or range of councils. This is not to say that we did not receive other responses, but some of them did not comment, because this consultation dealt with education and health as well as local government, and people commented in other respects. Some 62 per cent of those supported the seven-council model.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I know that people have pooh-poohed that idea, because only one of the major political parties favoured seven.

It is preposterous for noble Lords to dismiss these people or to laugh at them&#151;which is somewhat demeaning for noble Lords&#151;just because they are not contributing as political parties or as part of the vested interest political class. There has been a general consultation that takes into account the views of the political parties, but not in a dominant way, such as that put by the noble Lord, Lord Smith.

The fact that several hundred others did not express a view on the number of bodies would not be taken into account. I freely admit that, because they wanted to put other views that were not relevant. But of the bodies that took the trouble to say, &quot;We think we have something that is worth saying on the number of bodies in terms of service delivery to the Northern Ireland community&quot;, nearly two-thirds said that seven was better than 11 or 15. The noble Lord says that that does not really matter because they are not part of local government and are not involved in democratic accountability. But they were the ones who looked at the issue from a wider point of view and offered an opinion on the number of councils.

Coterminosity is a factor, and I do not deny that greater coterminosity and a larger range of &quot;one-to-one&quot; is achieved with seven councils than is the case with 11 or 15 councils. At my request, we considered a lower number of councils&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>

five rather than seven&#151;but the seven-council option gave the best result on the matrix of coterminosity, as well as with regard to the other factors involved.

I recall that when both of us were in the other place he used to defend representative democracy. What we find so surprising this evening is that he appears to be giving much greater weight to those who represent special interests, but in the United Kingdom surely we still believe that elective representatives best represent those opinions in the country. That must apply in Northern Ireland, as it did when the noble Lord was in the other place.

<a name="60426-24_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, yes, but we are not dealing with what I dealt with in the other place; we are dealing with Northern Ireland, which has a population of 1.7 million. In effect, we are dealing&#151;I am not demeaning it&#151;with a large county council. Let us not put too fine a point on it: 26 local councils in Northern Ireland are basically 26 parish councils in terms of the English model. That is what they do: they are parish councils. That is not to knock them. Those councillors have had a major input into the democratic process over the past 30 years because they have been the only people elected for delivery of service, but the service is that of parish councils.

<a name="60426-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Noble Lords have heard the figures involved: 3 or 4 per cent of public expenditure in Northern Ireland. That is a minuscule amount, and we are going to just more than double it. However, noble Lords need to consider the idea that 15 councils, as opposed to one, could be given powers, dealing with planning control and local roads. Frankly, from the point of view of economies of scale, it would not work. That is a factor to be taken into account when looking at value for money, as well as value for services. I fully accept the issue of distances, but we are not changing the position of where anyone lives. Frankly, the talk about Balkanisation is a complete&#151;if I may use a colour&#151;red herring. It is a red herring because it does not alter where anyone lives. The service that people get should be seamless, even with the change.

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>I shall address the point about change because it is not unimportant, given the scale of what is going on. Currently, there is an enormous change regime in Northern Ireland, most of it initiated by the Assembly when it was in being. This forms part of it. It was started and it has been left to direct-rule Ministers to finish it. I hope that they will finish it because the implementation process has been going on for almost three years. Come the end of the year, the Assembly could be back. In fact, it could be back at the end of May; there is nothing to stop it being back with a power-sharing executive at the end of May. We shall not stand in its way. The Assembly could take control of this. The boundary commissioner would be set up and running, but if Members of the Assembly wanted to change it, they could do so.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>Secondly, they could take control of the implementation. There would not be shadow elections until 2008 and the new councils would come into being <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_227"></a>

in 2009. But in June this year, 700,000 houses in Northern Ireland will get a letter explaining how the new rate bills are going to be constructed from 2007. Am I going to be faced with another debate in which noble Lords say, &quot;Oh, you shouldn&#039;t be doing this. We want the Assembly back doing this&quot;? These processes have been in place in Northern Ireland and have been consulted on <i>ad nauseam</i> in an attempt to achieve a modern civic society. Another point is that water rates will start next year. The Assembly can discuss all these matters. The Assembly Members can then take control of these policies and their implementation as soon as a power-sharing executive is back in place.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>We have said to those involved&#151;we mean this in a most friendly and genuine way&#151;that we are not going to mind the shop until they decide when they are going to do their bounden duty to govern Northern Ireland. We are going to push the reform programme, and, as Peter Hain has made clear, the longer direct-rule Ministers are there, the faster we will push the reform programme. That applies to health, education, rates, water rates and the other matters on local government reform. The sooner the Assembly and local politicians are back and taking charge, the better. We are genuinely not standing in their way but we are not going to mind the shop. We are not going to say to the people of Northern Ireland, &quot;You don&#039;t deserve a more modernised local government system&quot;&#151;which is what this will create; there is no question about that&#151;&quot;with far more powers for the local councillors delivering services&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>Why should civil servants deliver issues, whether in Belfast, Derry or wherever they may be based? Why should local councillors not deliver the services? The local councillors will be elected in 2008 in shadow form and will then decide where their executive or headquarters will be based. They will decide how they are going to appoint their chief executives. Frankly, it is not for someone in our position in Westminster to give detailed instructions to local councillors when people are saying that they want strong, purposeful local government&#151;in fact, far stronger local government than we already have in Northern Ireland. It is no good trying to be prescriptive. People have said, &quot;We want to be told where the headquarters are&quot;. Of course they do not want to be told where the headquarters are; they are perfectly capable of working out how they deliver the services and how they appoint their executive officers before they take their powers in 2009.

</p>

<a name="60426-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>I have to say to noble Lords that this is not being done on the back of an envelope. I am not claiming that it is perfect in every aspect, but the time from now to when the order is fully implemented will be taken into account by the Public Service Commission. The commission has a role; it is not there as a trade union but it is a public service staff commission and is important. Nine task forces are looking at how we deal with the work streams to make it work. Professionally and democratically, it is in everyone&#039;s interests that we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_228"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have a system that, so far as the public are concerned, provides better local government with more services delivered locally rather than by civil servants. Those services should be delivered by local councillors who make key decisions about their communities. That is not something that they do now, as they are responsible for only something like 4 per cent of public expenditure.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>You cannot have it both ways. You cannot do that with a population of 1.7 million and then say, &quot;Oh, we&#039;ll do it over 15 councils or split the difference and do it over 11&quot;, ignoring the research that we have published on coterminosity, which is not unimportant. If we are going to have community planning, where local councils are involved in every aspect of public life, including what the government do, with community planning techniques&#151;and we will use the model that has been used in Scotland&#151;it is crucial that there is as much coterminosity as possible in relation to the structure of the health boards, education and the police service, which will go down in number to seven. It is crucial that there is as much coterminosity as possible so that there cannot be any buck-passing.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>The public know who is delivering the service, what to do when it goes wrong, and how to kick them out. That has to be the model for local government in a normal civic society. One might argue about bits of the boundaries, which the Boundary Commission will look at, which is why there is flexibility in the order. Most of them are far more experienced in local government and far more experienced in Northern Ireland than I am. But it is left to our responsibility for what was started in Northern Ireland by the elected executive. I wish that it had got to grips with those decisions, but that is no excuse for putting off a decision on this Motion. It commences the Boundary Commission, which will take several months to get going. It will be next summer before it reports, so it will not be rushed through. There will be proper consultation with the normal Boundary Commission, and there will be all the work going on in parallel with all the other changes.
</p>

<a name="60426-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>By the end of November&#151;although it could be the end of May&#151;the Assembly could be back with a power-sharing executive getting a grip on the implementation. The earlier it is back, the more control it will have over the implementation of all these policies. We have no vested interest in keeping it at bay, trying to slip one through. We will not stop the reform programme, and the sooner it is back, the better. The longer it is away, the slower the reform programme will proceed. That is not bullying and it is not a threat. It is the reality if we are to bring a more modern civic society to Northern Ireland.

<a name="60426-25_ignore0"></a><h3 align=center>Violent Crime Reduction Bill</h3>
<a name="time_21"></a>
<a name="60426-25_time1"></a><h5>8.30 pm</h5>
<p>
<a name="stpa_360"></a>House again in Committee on Clause 12.

</p>

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="60426-25_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman </b>   moved Amendment No. 64:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>Page 10, line 27, at end insert &quot;, provided that no charges shall be payable by any persons or clubs unless the local authority is satisfied on the basis of evidence that it is reasonable to impose charges on those particular persons or clubs&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment voices the continued concern of myself and my noble friend Lady Anelay about the serious flaws in this clause to which she has already spoken. The alcohol disorder zone proposed in Clause 12 in our opinion contains a fundamental flaw. There is nothing in the scheme in its current form to prevent a local authority from imposing blanket charges on licensed premises and clubs in an alcohol disorder zone, regardless of the degree to which the premises are contributing to the disorder. In our view, that is far too arbitrary and is potentially extremely unfair to those businesses that, for example, close well before the usual times when alcohol-fuelled disorder normally takes place.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The amendment that we propose imposes a requirement on the local authority that it must be satisfied that it is reasonable to impose charges on particular clubs or persons. This provides a safeguard for individual businesses that are entirely innocent of contributing to or causing alcohol-related crime. We acknowledge that establishing a causative link between individuals misbehaving due to excessive drink and specific licensed premises might be problematic, which is why we have set the test as one of reasonableness. The test is entirely straightforward and sensible. The issue is essentially one of fairness: why should a corner shop or convenience store that closes at 6 pm pay for the late night problems caused by a few irresponsible licence holders?
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>We on these Benches acknowledge that some licensed premises encourage irresponsible drinking&#151;for example, by free drink promotions and so-called happy hours, and by serving individuals who are already drunk. It is entirely reasonable that such irresponsible establishments should be penalised. But the main concern of the trade bodies representing the licensed trade is that there should be a link between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_231"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

paying any charge and being responsible for the alcohol-fuelled trouble. The amendment seeks to redress those concerns.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>In another place, the Minister seemed to suggest that attempts will be made to differentiate between certain premises when it comes to assessing how much each will be expected to pay. If that is the Government&#039;s intention, why is it going to be left to regulations and why is it not written into the Bill? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="60426-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I speak to Amendments Nos. 68 and 69, which attempt to deal with the same problem, but perhaps from a slightly different angle. There is a difficulty that the Government should acknowledge and deal with. As the noble Viscount said a moment ago, there is a basic unfairness if licensed premises which do not contribute to the trouble have to pay a charge simply because their premises are within the designated alcohol disorder zone. My amendments suggest that there should be an exemption from charges, in particular for premises where the supply of alcohol is not permitted between 8 pm and 8 am. I accept that that timing is arbitrary, but it is intended to deal with the corner shop, the supermarket and other premises that close early and are not open late at night causing the difficulties with which the Bill is designed to deal.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Amendment No. 69 fleshes out the matter a little more where it suggests that there should be an exemption for premises where the sale of alcohol has not contributed to alcohol-related disorder in the relevant alcohol disorder zone. That is stating it baldly. How do the Government propose to deal with the issue? Do they seriously suggest that a blanket charge should apply to every licensed premises in the zone, or do they seek to differentiate, as is only fair? I support the amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="60426-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The Bill provides for an exemption from the compulsory charge at Clause 12(6). A premises of which the principal use is not the sale of alcohol and where the availability of alcohol is not one of the main reasons why people enter or remain there will be exempt from the alcohol disorder zone charge, but that is the only exemption in the Bill. It would be best if, after mentioning that general reference point, I approached first Amendments Nos. 64 and 69, which, as constructed, would oblige local authorities to determine whether individual pubs and clubs had directly contributed in some way to alcohol-related crime and disorder before they were included within the scope of the alcohol disorder zone charge.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>I do not know whether that is what the noble Lords are attempting to achieve, but it would mean that the local authority would have to establish through some research an audit trail that clearly linked inebriated offenders in the public space back to each individual pub, club and off-licence that they may or may not have frequented. That seems to me to be a very difficult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_232"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

thing to achieve. If I were proposing that, I am sure that the accusation would be levelled at me that this was imposing an undue burden on the local authority.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>I accept that any proposition for an alcohol disorder zone has to be properly thought through. Yes, of course there will be a degree of research. But to try to track back all the individual actions of those who contributed in some volume to an area becoming blighted by alcohol-related offences would be difficult to achieve. Reflecting on my time in local government, I know that there are certainly areas of our city, Brighton, which have had street alcohol bans and so on. If that had been proposed as part of the proposition, I think people would have raised a number of questions about the extent of the exercise.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>The guidance will be stringent. The boundaries of alcohol disorder zones should be sufficiently tightly drawn to take account of potential displacement. I think that it would be reasonable to assume that all premises inside an alcohol disorder zone must be contributing in some way to the problem. For those reasons, I hope that noble Lords will withdraw or not move their amendments.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>Amendment No. 68 would amend the second limb of the exemption test so that premises would be exempt if the principal use of the premises were not the sale of alcohol and the premises traded between the hours of, say, 8 am and 8 pm. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, accepted that this was a somewhat arbitrary selection of hours, but nevertheless argued his case.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The amendment is perhaps intended to provide a bespoke exemption for off-licences. The Bill does not provide any of these bespoke exemptions for the off-trade, and I think that that is right. Alcohol disorder zones are there to secure collective responsibility for the problem of alcohol-related crime and disorder, and, as I think I said during one of the early debates, our expectation is that the alcohol disorder zone will be a measure to be considered as a last resort.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>What we would expect to have happened long before a proposition for an alcohol disorder zone is put in place is that local traders, particularly those involved in the sale and distribution of alcohol, would have been called together, would have been encouraged to act in concert, would have been in close contact with the police and the local authority, and would have taken a number of steps preliminary to getting anywhere near to the point where an alcohol disorder zone was considered.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>We seek that approach because we think it right that they act in partnership, collectively; it is to encourage collective responsibility&#151;given that alcohol clearly is identified as being a contributor to disorder in many locations&#151;that we seek this particular approach. The alcohol disorder zones are there to secure a more collective approach to the problems of alcohol-related crime and disorder.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>We believe that there is a pivotal role for the off-trade to play in tackling alcohol-related crime and disorder, and in particular in providing a secure gateway through robust proof-of-age policies to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_233"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 233</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ensure that under-age people cannot purchase alcohol. I accept fully that there is a tension in drawing a zone around a specific area and in providing a clear audit trail for the specific problems in the public space back to particular premises, but it is key that, in the last resort, the off-trade should accept collective responsibility for the problem.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>Of course, it is always open to specific off-premises to meet the terms of the exemptions in Clause 12(7). For example, convenience stores, which sell alcohol as a sideline, should be able to show that the sale of alcohol is not part of their principal business or the principal use of their premises. They may also be able to meet the requirements of the patronage test if the sale of alcohol is not the main reason or one of the main reasons why people enter their premises.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>So we are after achieving a practical outcome here. We do not think that exemptions phrased in the way suggested in these amendments are workable or effective. I pose this particular dilemma to those who support these amendments: in my own city, there is a street, St. James&#039;s Street, which has in it pubs, clubs, restaurants, off-licences, and one or perhaps even two convenience stores. They all have different opening times according to the nature of their business. Who is to say that the off-licence that is open, say, until 10 o&#039;clock is more or less a contributor to some of the problems that have occurred in the past within that street? It may well be that someone buys two or three cans of beer during the day, and the off-licence closes and finishes its business. They then move on to a pub and then later a club, and their behaviour becomes serious disorder and causes the sorts of problems that we are trying to tackle here. The off-licence may say, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, but we were only open until 10 o&#039;clock in the evening. We had no particular problem with that customer&quot;. But one can reasonably argue that it has contributed to that problem because, at some earlier stage in the day, it had the responsibility of whether to sell to that particular customer&#151;who has later gone on to cause problems having, perhaps, reached a higher order of inebriation.
</p>

<a name="60426-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>So it is difficult to see how one could possibly accept exemptions phrased as these are. The important principle here is to encourage those businesses to work together, wherever they may be within such an area, to secure a collective approach and some long-term, lasting solutions. I understand the reasons for the amendments but, in terms of practicality, we do not feel comfortable with them and we cannot accept them. I hope that the assurances that I have given will mean that your Lordships feel able to withdraw or not move these amendments.

<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="60426-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>  : The Minister talks about practicality. I have two main points. First, since the Minister was involved in local government in his part of the world, the local authority has taken on the responsibility of dealing with licensed premises, so he has no experience of the expertise that they are building up in looking at such premises.

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Secondly, under subsection (6), the local authority has to make a judgment regarding these exemptions anyway. It is, presumably, for the local authority to decide whether,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;the principal use to which the premises are put does not consist in or include the sale or supply of alcohol&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Equally, it is for it to decide whether,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;the availability of alcohol on those premises&quot;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>is or,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;is not the main reason&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>These days, what happens is that the local authority convenes hearings at which people give evidence. There is, then, no reason why a local authority could not come to a decision on an evidence-based approach, either along the lines suggested by the noble Viscount, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;the local authority is satisfied on the basis of evidence that it is reasonable&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>or on the basis that I have put forward in Amendment No. 69, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;the sale of alcohol has not contributed to alcohol-related disorder&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>In any event, whether it be the Government&#039;s original drafting, the Viscount&#039;s amendment or my amendments, the local authority is required to make a judgment and to come to a decision on whether exemption applies.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>As for the supply of alcohol, Amendment No. 68 premises that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;the supply of alcohol is not permitted between the hours of 8pm and 8am&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>I said that that was an arbitrary time, but there is nothing wrong with encouraging licensed premises, such as an off-licence within an alcohol disorder zone, to tailor the hours that it is open to such a provision. Instead of opening until 9 o&#039;clock and paying a charge, they open until 8 o&#039;clock.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Neither do I accept the argument that if a person starts off sober in the off-licence and, having consumed three or four cans of lager, goes on to drink in a variety of other establishments, ending up in a nightclub, the off-licence at which he got his original drink, while sober, should pay the same as the club, which serves him alcohol when he is clearly drunk. There is a point when it can be said, &quot;This licensed premises is less involved in creating disorder within this particular zone than other licensed premises&quot;. It is only fair that a distinction should be made. I do not propose the final mechanism, but there should be one that permits distinctions to be made.

<a name="60426-26_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman: </b>   I am grateful for the support from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and to the Minister for his attempts to explain the reasonableness of his case. However, we are unconvinced by the explanation and still have a problem. Take, for instance, a really respectable and upmarket wine merchant&#039;s that happens to be in a disorderly zone. That is really a victim of a postcode lottery which requires recognition. We shall study <br>&nbsp;<br>

carefully what the Minister has said, but we will probably come back to this on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</p>

<a name="60426-26_para10"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60426-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </b>   moved Amendment No. 66:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>Page 11, line 1, leave out &quot;only&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 67. The effect of the amendments would be to ensure that the two types of licensed premises set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) would be exempt from any charges imposed by virtue of the clause. The first type would be those premises whose principal use did not involve the sale of alcohol; and the second would be those premises where the availability of alcohol is not the main purpose for which individuals enter them. The way that I drafted the amendments means that they should not fall foul of the Minister&#039;s objections on the previous amendment, Amendment No. 64. Indeed, his answer to my noble friend Lord Bridgeman was that premises would be exempted anyway, if the availability of alcohol was not the main reason why people went into them&#151;or, I think that he said, stayed in them. At this late hour, that conjures up some interesting ideas about what they might be doing.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>My argument is that it is wrong to leave it to the discretion of the Secretary of State to make such exemptions. There seems no reason to include such premises in the charging scheme. The Minister has already said that they will not be included. If not, why not? If so, why not state that in the Bill? The removal of the word &quot;only&quot; in the amendment also has the advantage of allowing the possibility of creating further exemptions over and above those set out in paragraphs (a) and (b). Surely that is a sensible way to proceed. There must be the possibility of other exemptions, if it becomes demonstrably clear that certain licensed premises are unjustly caught up in the Bill without good reason or are disproportionately burdened. It is right that regulation should be able to take account of those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>This is one of the key concerns of the licensed trade. The representative organisations, such as the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience Stores, support the amendments, so they therefore have the backing of a significant number of stakeholders who could be affected should the Bill become law in its present form.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>I now find myself in horror because I used the word &quot;stakeholders&quot;. Ten years of Labour government have clearly had some dreadful effect on me. I shall take the medicine tonight and get rid of that. Goodness me.
</p>

crime and alcohol disorder. They have made that clear throughout all their discussions both with me and, I know, with the Government. They have actively supported involuntary codes of conduct and schemes to encourage responsible drinking and the retailing of alcohol. However, they are unanimous in voicing their concern that Chapter 2 would have a disproportionate effect on the retail sector without actually tackling the root causes of the issue. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="60426-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I entirely agree with the amendment. There should be room for additional exemptions to be made to those named. As for the word &quot;stakeholders&quot;, I remind the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that the full <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, in all its volumes, says that its first recorded use was in 1976, by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, so we have claimed it for the Liberal Democrats for some time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="60426-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I think that that is almost an admission of guilt. Anyway, it is not relevant.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The intention behind Amendment No. 66 is to allow for more exemptions to be included in the regulations to be made under the Bill. The amendment would insert into the Bill a requirement to include in regulation the exemption detailed in Clause 6. Taken together, the amendments would clearly open the door to a whole host of further exemptions, in addition to that in Clause 6.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>As I said earlier, I understand why Members of the Committee might want to offer up such exemptions, but I cannot accept the amendments. It is important that we use the policy as an encouragement to a collective form of responsibility. I know that that sense of collective responsibility does not always make people on the opposition Benches entirely happy. It is an important principle, but I do not think that there is yet a common understanding between us that alcohol disorder zones are an instrument of last resort, as we believe, and that they are there as part of the general encouragement of such a collective responsibility. This principle could be eroded if we were to accept the amendments, and I do not think that that is in the best interests of the operation of the policy. By including it in the regulations, a plethora of exemptions would allow premises to avoid paying the charge. That brings a problem with it, because the fewer the premises that pay the charge, the higher the charge is likely to be. The charge must therefore be shared reasonably; such terms are more desirable.
</p>

<a name="60426-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>I can, however, give assurances that the exemption in Clause 12(6) will be included in the regulations, and that guidance will be issued on the application of the exceptional clause. So there is the opportunity to flesh out more of what we mean by this. The noble Baroness says that too much is being left to another time in terms of regulations and to another place in terms of guidance, but that is the sensible way in which to deal with such issues of detail. I am sure that what I have said will not satisfy noble Lords on the Opposition <br>&nbsp;<br>

Benches, but that is our approach to this, and I hope that at least my reassurance will encourage them not to press their amendments at this stage.

<a name="60426-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I have always thought so highly of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, but I shall have to review my opinion, as he is the source of the word, which I shall not repeat.
</p>

<a name="60426-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I am grateful to the Minister, even though he says no again. But he has given an assurance at the Dispatch Box that the exemptions in the two subsections will be included in the regulations. I shall consult the wine trade, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience Stores between now and Report to see if they feel that that assurance is sufficiently strong for them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60426-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I should add that we would expect them to be party to the consultations, so they will have the opportunity to make their views known through that process, too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="60426-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   That is a very helpful addition. The Minister has, of course, taken us to task, saying that the Government have this high-minded approach to collective responsibility. Well, come down off the mountain; we agree with collective responsibility, but it is a case of how one defines responsibility and for what, and to what extent it is fair to expect individuals to be responsible for the group. One must recall that the licensed trade has taken some highly responsible steps towards policing, in the loosest sense, their own trade. The Minister will know of all the examples around the country of the licensed trade even working with local authorities to move a taxi rank or a bus stop so that people coming out of licensed premises will not gather and perhaps get into more difficulty than they should. Very sensible, proactive steps have been taken. There is a feeling out there that the work of these responsible traders has not necessarily been recognised, and that they will be hammered because of the lack of activity by others. I know that we shall come back to that theme.
</p>

<a name="60426-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>When the Minister talks about collective responsibility, he must also bear in mind that the Government themselves are exempting some groups from that collective responsibility. That must mean that people will say, &quot;Why not me, too?&quot;. I accept the Minister&#039;s assurance tonight so far as it goes but, given that the amendments came from outside bodies, it is only right that I should consult them to see if the assurance is sufficient.

in which charges for alcohol disorder zones might be imposed, it seems extraordinary that the setting out of the appeals process has been left to regulations. There seems to be a considerable lapse in attention to detail in this particular part of the Bill. We believe that it is fundamentally important that an individual who is held liable to pay certain charges is able to appeal that decision and appeal the rate at which he is being charged. At present, we have not been given the opportunity to look at exactly what that appeals process will be. There is a need for a proper check on the broad powers being conferred on local authorities through the alcohol disorder zones scheme, but at present it is being left to the Secretary of State to create that process by regulations without the level of scrutiny that we should have at this stage. Exactly what is the appeals process that the Government intend to put in place?
<a name="time_23"></a>
<a name="60426-27_time0"></a><h5>9 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60426-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>My proposed new clauses suggest a method by which a licence holder might appeal against the designation of a zone in its entirety or regarding a specific area within the zone. Although Clause 12(9) makes provision for appeals relating to the payment and enforcement of the charge&#151;in effect, against the charging provisions&#151;no system is proposed by which one can challenge the designation itself. A business, or indeed a group of businesses, might well be affected by the designation terms of revenue as well as by the actual payment of the charges. It might be that people will be deterred from coming into an alcohol disorder zone&#151;for example, to eat at a family restaurant&#151;because of the negative connotations that such a designation may carry.
</p>

<a name="60426-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Therefore, we believe that it would be sensible to provide for a process that allows such an appeal to take place&#151;and is guaranteed to allow such an appeal&#151;rather than exposing local authorities to the possibility of judicial review proceedings every time a designation is challenged. We hope that the Minister is able to accept our proposals. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="60426-27_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We strongly support the introduction of a proper appeals system on the face of the Bill. It should be remembered that the decisions that are to be made under Clause 12(8) will be decisions made by a local authority. It would be hugely expensive to have to take those decisions on fairly minor matters&#151;liability for charges and rate of charges, for example&#151;by way of judicial review. The setting up of a tribunal, on the other hand, which could quickly gather an expertise on these matters, would much improve anything that the Bill so far contains.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="60426-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendments seek to create a right of appeal for licence holders against the designation of an alcohol disorder zone to a bespoke alcohol disorder zone tribunal. We have designed an alcohol disorder zone process to be flexible and speedy to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder with the minimum of delay. At the same time, we have provided key checks and balances to be put into the process. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_239"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

They comprise a joint local authority/police trigger for an alcohol disorder zone in which each party must consent to designation. So they have to be satisfied that it is right and give their consent. They also include a formal consultation process lasting 28 days; an eight-week period following that to allow the commencement of the action plan&#151;though it can be shorter if it is clear that there is no intention to implement the plan; and a formal three-monthly review of designation. There are a number of elements to the process.
</p>

<a name="60426-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Additionally, Clause 12(9) provides that regulations may make provision for appeals relating to the payment, collection and enforcement of the charge and liability for payment of the charge. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that it does not seem entirely sensible that each time there is a challenge, a judicial review has to be sought. That is inappropriate. A more workable scheme than a tribunal, an appeals process like a tribunal, makes a lot of sense. We have said that we will work with those involved&#151;whom you might call &quot;stakeholders&quot;, if you are the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, or &quot;the affected alcohol community&quot;. There are lots of descriptions at hand. We are working with this body of able folk to see how we can best deliver this and link it into existing local government procedures. So we are consulting with those who should be consulted. I think that that is the best way of achieving it. That will provide a robust set of checks and balances, without the need for building in a potentially lengthy appeals process, whether it is set out on the face of the Bill or through regulations.
</p>

<a name="60426-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>I understand the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord about appeals. However, I think we have set up a situation which provides for sufficient checks and balances, without the need for a whole new tier of bureaucracy to determine appeals. We have to set that elaborate process on one side. Clause 12(9) makes provision for a system of appeals for a range of things relating to payment, collection and so on, which I referred to earlier. I do not think that we are going as far as the noble Baroness and the noble Lord want, but we have put in place a process of robust checking, and we have made the provisions I have referred to in Clause 12(9). I hope that that will prove to be satisfactory. We will, of course, listen with great care to the stakeholders in this part of legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="60426-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I take issue with the use of the word bureaucracy. This is not about setting up a bureaucracy but about setting up an independent tribunal to determine what could be very important issues to a particular licensee. I appreciate that there will be consultation, but the licensee may find himself within a zone, paying charges that are determined for him, without any right of appeal to an independent tribunal. I do not know what will be produced by the consultations that the noble Lord is having with the industry. But if it were some sort of higher committee of the local authority, then that would obviously be quite unacceptable. From the point of view of ensuring <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that this Bill is put into effect with a sense of fairness and justice, I think it is worth while that there should be an independent appeals system such as that set out in Amendment No. 96 and thereafter.

The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, responded by saying that the Government like the idea of having more of a tribunal system and that they want something robust which has checks and balances. But then he accused me of trying to introduce a bureaucracy, when it appeared that the more he went into his explanation, the more his system became more bureaucratic than mine. There is a fundamental disagreement between us on what is needed on the face of the Bill to ensure a fair way in which the licence trade may make its appeals against what could be a significant payment by it on a monthly basis. I would never claim that the proposals put forward in my clauses are perfect. But they do represent my view that it is only fair that there should be an independent tribunal, not a bureaucracy, which would give fairness and equity to the licensed trade. It is on that basis that I will ask the opinion of the Committee.

&quot;(   )   Regulations made under subsection (8) shall include provision for appeals against decisions determining such questions as set out in subsection (8)(b).&quot;

<p><a name="st_193"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 72, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 73. The amendments follow on from the previous amendments, to which my noble friend Lady Anelay has spoken. The purpose of this group of amendments is to try to get some idea of when draft regulations will be published relating to the charges that will be imposed on licence holders in alcohol disorder zones.
</p>

<a name="60426-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>It was as long ago as last October that the Government were asked in another place when these draft regulations might be available, and six months later we still have not had a chance to examine them. Bearing mind the amount of detail that is being left to regulations, can the Minister give the Committee an assurance that draft regulations will be available to be scrutinised before Report stage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>It has been left to regulations to specify the rate of charges, exemptions and discounts, payments and enforcement and the appeals process. We have already discussed the issue of regulations that specify what the money raised by the scheme can and cannot be used for. These details are absolutely critical if we are to get a clear picture of what the effect of an alcohol disorder zone designation will have&#151;both on businesses and on alcohol-related disorder itself. Before conferring such sweeping powers on local authorities, does the Minister agree that this House needs greater time for scrutiny of the details of such schemes? I beg to move.

<a name="60426-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendments are devised&#151;and I believe that the noble Viscount explained it this way&#151;to get on the record some idea of when draft regulations will be published. All I can say at this stage is that the draft regulations will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible after the Act comes into force and that alcohol disorder zones cannot properly function without that secondary legislation. I can also make it clear that we are committed to dealing with the regulations by affirmative resolution. I do not believe that there is any need to include a provision to this effect in the Bill.

<a name="60426-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>Amendment No. 73 would compel the Secretary of State to publish regulations within one month of the Act coming into force. I am sure that the noble Viscount will tell me otherwise, but it is a while since I can recall a piece of legislation making such a grand stipulation. It would be wrong to try to tie us down to such a tight timetable. I understand the noble Viscount&#039;s frustration, which has been expressed on a number of occasions during today&#039;s deliberations. I am reluctant to say this tonight, but I will obviously confer further with my colleagues and officials to see what more we can say at a later stage in the Bill about the timetable for bringing forth regulations. I certainly understand the sense of frustration that is apparent.
</p>

<a name="60426-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>With that being the only assurance I can offer this evening, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment. I will undertake to ask whether we can provide a slightly firmer sense of how we intend to proceed with the regulatory regime that comes forward in secondary legislation. I understand the desire for there to be a timetable and for transparency&#151;it is a commitment that we want to be able to give. I cannot say more than that this evening but I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60426-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>The noble Viscount said: Clause 13 sets out the steps the local authority must take before designation of a locality takes place. The test for designation in subsection (1) is a relatively low one. The local authority could make such a designation if satisfied that there has been alcohol-related nuisance, annoyance or disorder. Given the importance of such a decision to designate, it would be far more appropriate if a set of objective conditions had to be met before a decision of this nature was made. That would provide more reassurance to those businesses likely to be affected by any such designations. This kind of designation should occur only when criteria have been fully, clearly and demonstrably met, and not at the whim of a local authority. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   The noble Viscount is a little unfair in using the word &quot;whim&quot;.

<a name="60426-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Clause 13 sets out criteria for designating an area as an alcohol disorder zone and specifies the steps that local authorities and the police must take before a zone can be so designated. The noble Viscount&#039;s amendment relates to the criteria and those steps.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>The Bill provides that the local authority must be satisfied that the tests are met. The amendment seems to be aimed at making the test applied by the local authority more objective. As my noble friend Lord Borrie said, that is always a desirable practice but, in effect, we do not think that the amendment will have any impact on achieving that end.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a> I understand the intention behind the amendment but we have made it clear that alcohol disorder zones are an intervention of last resort. Accordingly, local authorities and the police will have to present an objective and transparent case for proposing an alcohol disorder zone. It cannot be, to use the noble Viscount&#039;s expression, made at someone&#039;s whim. There needs to be a system of proper checks and balances in place. But do we need this amendment to achieve that end? I suggest that we do not. The guidance provided for under the Bill will make specific and particular reference to the case for an alcohol disorder zone, and that is the most intelligent way to proceed. It will cover the type of evidence base within which local authorities will have to demonstrate that the criteria have been met. It is in the interests of local communities and certainly of local authorities and the police to promote that approach. In that way, those who are involved in securing the action plan will have a degree of what is sometimes described in the business as &quot;buy-in&quot; to the scheme.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We want an objective approach; we do not want a whimsical approach. I should have thought that given his new leader&#039;s enthusiasm for encouraging local interest, local discretion and more local powers for local authorities, the noble Viscount would have welcomed placing with local authorities a responsibility which builds on those conferred on them in the Licensing Act 2003. We on this side sometimes call this an element of new localism. That local authorities take responsibility and encourage collective responsibility is welcome. Alcohol disorder zones go a lot further down that route. That is the approach that we want to secure. I hope that the noble Viscount, having heard what I have said, will be happy to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60426-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>   moved Amendment No. 75:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>Page 11, line 38, after &quot;been&quot; insert &quot;persistent and repeated&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 76, 77 and 78, although I shall not pursue Amendment No. 76 at this stage.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>Bringing into being the machinery which the implementation of Clause 13 requires will be a lengthy process. The local authority must first of all publish the notice which sets out its proposal to designate a zone and invite representations. A period of 28 days will then elapse. At the end of that period, the local authority and the local chief officer of police must produce the action plan, publish it, and send it to licensed premises that are affected.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>It is only if, eight weeks later, they decide that the action plan is not being implemented or will not be implemented at all that they can make the order as set out in Clause 13(1). The Minister has said on a number of occasions that this is an action of last resort. When one considers the lengthy&#151;I hesitate to use the word &quot;cumbersome&quot;&#151;procedure that is involved before the designation can be made, it is obvious that it will not be made lightly. Consequently, it ought not to be made on anything other than very firm grounds.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>It is for that reason that Amendment No. 75 suggests that,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;the nuisance or annoyance to members of the public, or a section of the public,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>as referred to in Clause 13(1)(a), should be &quot;persistent and repeated&quot;. This procedure ought not to be triggered by a single incident. That would be a perfectly reasonable amendment to make to that subsection.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Objection is taken to the suggestion that the nuisance or annoyance to members of the public does not have take place in the locality that is to be designated as an alcohol disorder zone and that an area may be so designated if the nuisance is &quot;near that locality&quot;. I cannot see the point of designating one part of the community as an alcohol disorder zone on the basis of what has happened in another part of the community. So why use the words &quot;or near&quot; in the legislation? Either one deals with the issue that arises within a particular locality or one does not. I cannot see why the licensees in one part of the town should pay charges to the local authority for nuisance and annoyance which have not occurred in that locality but somewhere else. I should like an explanation for the drafting of subsection (1)(a). That is why Amendment No. 77 suggests that the words &quot;or near&quot; be left out.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>The Bill creates many powers to deal with disorder that arises through the use of licensed premises. We suggest that the local authority should be satisfied before it goes through the procedure of making the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60426-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I hope the Minister will take these proposed amendments as an attempt to be constructive and that these disorder zones will be instituted only as a measure of last resort. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="60426-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I will just refer to the words &quot;or near&quot;, which is one part of what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has dealt with. I thought that the inclusion of those words was valuable, in that it would deal with a situation where there is an area or part of a town where a lot of drunkenness or activity that may cause concern to the public takes place; there is then a distance, maybe half a mile, to bus stops, a train service or something of that sort. There are no pubs or places for drinking in that locality, but it is near to the locality where the trouble has been caused. Surely one wants to be able to cover that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="60426-29_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I will certainly want to consider carefully what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said, but my immediate reaction is that I would be very unhappy with his interpretation being part of the Bill, as it would take collective responsibility to a level that I had not interpreted it to mean. I would be grateful if the Minister could, when he comes to respond, explain to us whether the view of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is the view of the Government. It may be that the Box can assist with that. The noble Lord has raised an interesting explanation of why &quot;or near&quot; might be valuable, but we will need to look at whether it really would be of value and be acceptable. I genuinely find it interesting. The issue was not raised in another place, and we will need to look at it.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>Amendment No. 75 has value, because it would ensure that the problems that one wishes to address are not just a one-off event. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has said, the measure will not be triggered by a single incident. I had always assumed that the Government were trying to avoid having an alcohol disorder zone imposed as a result of a single incident. If so, why are they worrying about having an action plan and consultation? To me, this would present the case that the Government are trying to do all they can to avoid having an alcohol disorder zone imposed. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is right: one needs to make sure that the opportunity for designation after a single incident is excluded. He has performed a valuable service.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The noble Lord is also right to draw attention to the drafting of Clause 13. Paragraph (b) talks about &quot;nuisance, annoyance or disorder&quot;. I find myself very uncomfortable with the use of the word &quot;annoyance&quot;. That is a very low-level test, even if it is connected with alcohol consumption in the locality. It could obviously constitute something relatively trivial, like one of the usual bits of annoyance in any area: someone parking outside your premises, for example. It is on a public highway, but you do not like them doing it. Such behaviour tends to create quite a lot of antagonism, particularly if people do it on more than one <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 246</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occasion&#151;it might be a persistent and repeated activity. Whether something like that, even if it is a persistent and repeated annoyance, should come within the provisions of Clause 13, I remain to be persuaded. I will be interested to hear how the Minister responds to that.
</p>

<a name="60426-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has raised issues that we will need to consider between now and Report.

We are already teasing out some particular issues that will need probing, rather than resolution on Report.

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="60426-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Baroness is right that our discussion on alcohol disorder zones has fleshed out some important elements. It is right that we should take the time between now and Report to reflect on some of those points. What I have liked about our debates today is that they have been pragmatic and practically focused, because that is the intention behind the legislation. I am grateful for the approach that has been adopted by both opposition Benches on this range of issues.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>I shall deal with the amendments in turn. The noble Lord&#039;s first two amendments&#151;although I know that he said that he was not too bothered about Amendment No. 76&#151;focus on the first test, which establishes the link between the consumption of alcohol and the level of proof that is required to establish that the criteria for designation have been satisfied. On the general test&#151;and I repeat the point that I have been making all evening&#151;alcohol disorder zones are an intervention of the last resort. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, recognises and understands that; he took us carefully through the process by which we arrive at the point at which local authorities or the police might want to seek to have an alcohol disorder zone put in place. We want to make it clear that it is the end of a process to try to foster and encourage that sense of collective responsibility to which I have referred.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>We want the power to be used as flexibly as possible. The Bill provides the overall framework. Clause 16 provides for guidance to be issued on the administration of alcohol disorder zones. Subsection (2) places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the guidance sets out the alternative steps that should be taken prior to proposing an alcohol disorder zone. Subsection (4) places a duty on local authorities to follow the guidance. I envisage that the guidance will set out in clear terms the alternative interventions to deal with alcohol-related crime and disorder, including tackling those incidents that are not persistent&#151;although the fact that incidents are persistent is one of the things that will cause the local authority and the police, acting together, to consider moving towards an alcohol disorder zone. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, we would not see a single incident as the trigger for such an approach&#151;although one incident might highlight a generality of problems.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_247"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>We do not need the reference to &quot;persistent and repeated&quot; for which the first amendment provides. The second amendment relates to establishing a link to the levels of crime or disorder required to trigger an alcohol disorder zone. We would not want to lose the general link with the consumption of alcohol in the locality. The policy that we have adopted in our approach is about securing collective responsibility for the problem across the alcohol trade locally, in both the off-licence trade and the on-licence trade. We have to accept that it is often not possible to establish a clear audit trail for the problem in the public space back to individual premises. Again, I do not see the need to lose the link between disorder, anti-social behaviour and alcohol. I hope that the noble Lord will not press his first two amendments.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Amendment No. 77 provoked a discussion about locality. The noble Lord seeks to require that the levels of nuisance and annoyance to members of the public that are included as criteria for the designation of the locality occur precisely in the locality. He is concerned that such activities and incidents of nuisance and annoyance should occur in that locality, rather than somewhere adjacent to it. I understand the sentiment behind the amendment and I can reassure the noble Lord that the zone is to be used where the nuisance and annoyance to the public are most likely to be repeated. Where that is the case, the area will be within the designated zone.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>The key issue is displacement. Problems caused in licensed premises in one area may manifest themselves much more clearly in an adjacent area. I have in my mind an image of a parade of shops or perhaps even a whole street, and within that street are a number of different premises&#151;off-licences, public houses, clubs and bars and so on. In some places, it is likely that the incidents which cause the nuisance will take place a little way from where the alcohol is purchased and in a place where the alcohol is consumed.

<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="60426-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Perhaps I may interrupt the noble Lord and try to deal with the illustration given by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. What is envisaged in Clause 13 is an action plan, and the costs of that fall on the licensees. If the disorder does not happen where the licensed premises are located, how can the licensees respond to an action plan somewhere else? What are they supposed to do? You cannot expect the licensees to pay for policing the whole town.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>For some reason or another, I keep thinking of St James&#039;s Street in Brighton when I talk about this issue. The people in St James&#039;s Street, who may be perfectly respectable licensees, cannot be responsible for what happens in the railway station, the bus station or a taxi rank somewhere else in town. They cannot send their bouncers, or whatever they have in St James&#039;s Street, to sort out these problems; nor, indeed, can they pay for private security firms to roam the whole of Brighton. That is the problem.

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column 248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I can understand an action plan which says, &quot;You will not serve someone who is drunk; you will remove them from the premises. You will make sure that your premises are properly monitored by security people who are qualified&quot;, and matters of that sort. But I cannot see a private army, paid for by licensees, trying to police another area. That, to my mind, is the problem with the words &quot;or near&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="60426-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord raises some important issues. Of course, one would not expect the licensees to contribute through the alcohol disorder zone to policing another far-away part of the town. But one might expect the charges raised as a result of the alcohol disorder zone to contribute towards the cost of extra policing in a street or open space close by. Or one might expect licensees, for example, to help through the alcohol disorder zone fund to pay for taxi marshals in an adjacent street or on part of the main streets close to where the licensed premises are located. I think that that is a reasonable expectation of what an alcohol disorder zone charging regime would contribute towards.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>The local authority will want to consider very carefully&#151;no doubt it will be part of detailed considerations and consultations locally&#151;designating a zone which is very tightly drawn and which includes the area where the nuisance is most likely to be repeated. That is how we see it working as a matter of practical application.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Amendment No. 78 deals with other measures that should be properly considered before getting to the point at which an alcohol disorder zone is identified as the appropriate remedy. The noble Lord referred to the Licensing Act 2003, and said that those provisions should be fully used to ensure that individual premises have appropriate operating schedules to deal with potential problems.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I agree in general with that approach. The guidance to the provision will set out explicitly that alcohol disorder zones are a measure of last resort, and the circumstances in which they should be used. As an example, where there is a problem with individual premises, of course it would be more sensible to use a licence review against those premises than to declare it an alcohol disorder zone. As I said, alcohol disorder zones are about getting licensees to adopt collective responsibility. The Licensing Act 2003 greatly strengthens local authorities&#039; hands against individual premises, and the alcohol disorders zones policy adds to that and provides them with a valuable tool to establish that collective responsibility as a matter of principle.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>I do not think that the noble Lord&#039;s amendments are necessary, nor do they add a further layer of clarification, which we can fairly say is already there in the Bill, and will be there as a product of the regulations and guidance that we shall consult on later in the process. I understand the sentiments but our approach makes more sense. I hope that my comments have also satisfied some of the concerns about the way in which the scheme will be constructed.

<a name="60426-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The noble Viscount said: I move the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady Anelay and myself. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has obligingly set out the timetable in the process by which an area can be designated as an alcohol disorder zone, so I can speak much more briefly to this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Amendment No. 79 would speed up the process by ensuring that the draft action plan is published at the same time as the proposal to designate is issued. That way, stakeholders will be able to see the action plan at the consultation stage and can make representations about it rather than being presented with a fait accompli after the opportunity to make representations has passed.
</p>

<a name="60426-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>In another place, the Minster agreed with that in principle but stated in Committee on 20 October that the Government would spell out,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;through a combination of regulations and guidance&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>what a proposal to designate could contain. She also gave a categoric assurance that that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>&quot;will include a requirement to publish the proposed content of the action plan at the consultation stage&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>She went on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;that that would be a proper way of proceeding, and better than specifying everything in the Bill&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 20/10/06; col. 146.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>It will come as no surprise to know that we do not agree with that. Our amendment shows how straightforward it would be to include such a requirement on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I support the amendment because the proposal to designate the locality will be served by way of a notice if the proposals of the action plan are served at the same time so that local licensees know what is in store for them. The representations that are to be received under subsection (2)(b) are likely to be much fuller and much more focused than would otherwise be the case.

<a name="60426-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, did not speak to Amendment No. 86, but I am assuming that he is dealing with it because it is grouped with Amendment No. 79.

<a name="60426-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I am sorry, I did not appreciate that Amendment No. 86 was grouped with it. That underlines what I said a moment ago: that the fullest of consultations together with the action plan should be carried out.

<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="60426-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Amendment No. 79 would place a duty on a local authority to publish the content of the proposed action plan when issuing the notice to begin the alcohol disorder zone process. I understand the point behind the amendment: it is right. We know from our consultation with the stakeholders that it is important for interested parties to have an opportunity to see the proposed action plan at the consultation stage. I would also go further and say that it is important that interested parties also see what actions might be undertaken at the compulsory charging stage, so that they have a picture of where the process could end up.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>However, this amendment is not the right way to secure that end. I agree with the objective but I do not agree with the way in which the noble Viscount seeks to achieve it. I can assure noble Lords that through a combination of regulations and guidance we will ensure that what we mean by the proposal to designate an alcohol disorder zone is spelt out and spelt out with clarity. It will include a requirement to publish the proposed content of the action plan at the consultation stage. That should satisfy the concerns that have been raised.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>Amendment No. 86 would make a specific provision for the affected businesses to be consulted on the action plan. It is clear that it is crucial that the licensed trade along with other interested parties is fully involved at every stage along the route; particularly at the stage when representations are made and an action plan is being prepared. When the local authority publishes the proposed action plan together with a package of measures that will be undertaken using the compulsory charge should the alcohol disorder zone be designated it is vital that the trade engages in a meaningful way. Inserting a provision for consultation in the draft action plan would imply that there needed to be an additional formal round of consultation after the 28 days had elapsed. That would build into the process an unnecessary delay.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>I offer the assurance that through guidance local authorities will be made aware of the need to engage with the trade. We have that as a clear objective. I am grateful that the noble Viscount has that as a clear objective. With that reassurance I hope that he will not press his amendment because we are at one. We think that our approach achieves the end more simply and without adding another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and further delaying the process.

</p>

<a name="60426-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford: The Minister has spoken in such a way that if there was a failure to consult, application for judicial review would undoubtedly succeed.

</p>

<a name="60426-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>Viscount Bridgeman: I am most grateful to the Minister. At least he has taken on the intention behind the amendment. We are disappointed that we cannot get it into the Bill, but with that I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>Clause 6 [<i>Duty to secure sufficient childcare for working parents</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>
<a name="60426-31_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton </b>   moved Amendment No. 14:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 4, line 8, after &quot;sufficient&quot; insert &quot;and is likely to remain sufficient&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 14, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 41. Before I do so, I thank the Minister for all the information sent this week. I shall repay the compliment throughout today&#039;s proceedings by asking lots of questions.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>Clause 6 places an obligation on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare places to meet the requirements in the Bill. Clause 11 places a duty on local authorities to assess this sufficiency at least every three years and to keep assessments under review. Amendments Nos. 14 and 41 are all about ensuring sustainability and, therefore, stability.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>Conducting an audit of what provision is already available is, although time-consuming, a relatively easy part of the process, but issues such as changes in how people work and the mobility and flexibility of the workforce are complex. Not least, there are rapidly changing demographics: since the 1970s, the population of under-fives has been on a downward trend, although it is expected to rise slightly by 2020. We are almost asking local authorities to become crystal-ball gazers, and in an unfamiliar and demanding area. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will have some pertinent questions for the Minister on how assessing sufficiency will work in practice when she speaks to her Amendment No. 30, so I shall not rehearse them here.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>Much of the new childcare provision is being set up with a five-year funding plan, although I am sure that we shall have to look much further ahead than that. It is coming in with heavy subsidy at the front end. There <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are genuine concerns that these places may not be sustainable and that a level playing field is not operating. The National Day Nurseries Association recognises the need to widen accessibility to childcare and make it affordable to more families, but it stresses that, to maintain diversity of provision, aspirations for the pricing regime must remain realistic. Local authorities must be mindful that overheads and financial pressures differ between the public, private and voluntary sectors.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, may have been going to remind the Grand Committee of this anyway but, in last week&#039;s sitting, in response to another amendment, she said that the document <i>Childcare Bill: Duty to Secure Sufficient Childcare </i>states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;Local authorities should consider the range of ways that they can work with childcare providers to improve the affordability of childcare&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>The noble Baroness warned that, in other areas in which she had been involved, that was sometimes a way of trying to force prices down. I very much hope that that will not happen here. It is especially true in London and the south-east, and if local authorities do not take it into account, there is real danger that they will drive private and voluntary operations out of the market&#151;and then there would be no diversity of provision.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>As my honourable friend Tim Loughton said in another place, it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>&quot;no good creating new, heavily subsidised child care places only to knock out perfectly good-quality existing ones&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 28/11/05; col. 94.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>Current government figures show that three childcare places are closing for every five opening.
</p>

<a name="60426-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>There are genuine concerns that this laudable Bill could, if we are not careful, lead to nationalisation of childcare. Existing providers must be given adequate assurance that new childcare will not be created without consulting them and appropriate market research. Parents must be given adequate assurance that they will have real choice for their children, with stability in that choice. These assurances can be achieved with the acceptance of these amendments. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_3"></a>
<a name="60426-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I support Amendment No. 14 and shall speak to Amendment No. 30, which would ensure that the Government issued guidance defining &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; and &quot;sufficient&quot;. We are anxious to see set out the factors that local authorities must consider when assessing and securing childcare provision. That will help to give parents a clearer understanding of what they can expect from local authorities. As was discussed at some length last week, the Bill places a duty on local authorities to improve outcomes for young people, and to narrow the gap between the poorest and the rest.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>Crucially, this duty to provide childcare focuses solely on meeting the needs of working parents, or those in training for work. Yet we know from the Government&#039;s own child poverty review that, of the 2.6 million children living in low-income <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

households, roughly half&#151;in some of the poorest families in the country&#151;are in workless households. Amendment No. 14 therefore broadly raises the question of what is deemed &quot;sufficient&quot;. Local authorities need specific guidance from the Secretary of State, not just on the general provision of childcare but on what the Government regard as &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; and &quot;sufficient&quot;. The Bill states that local authorities must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>Will the Minister assure us that these matters&#151;the detailed issues and what happens to workless families&#151;will be addressed in guidance? Local authorities need to be clear on what this new duty requires them to do in practice, and how they will be judged when they have to deliver it. For example, will the assessment of the demand for childcare include an analysis of the demand in relation to cost, quality, type or hours of childcare? What about the degree of choice parents can have? All these issues must be answered. Local authorities will need guidance to provide childcare regarded as &quot;sufficient&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60426-32_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I shall not speak to my amendment, but will support Amendment No. 41, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, on the quality and sustainability of childcare places. Before doing so, I apologise to your Lordships for speaking at too great a length and without clarity both at Second Reading and on the first day of Committee. I am afraid that I have been taking too much on for the past few months. I am sorry to have added to the burden on your Lordships, particularly those on the Front Benches.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>Her Majesty&#039;s Government have already made the case for introducing an assessment of quality by local authorities. The Minister has acknowledged the continuing challenge of the childcare workforce. I welcome what the Minister said about improvements in the level of graduate staff, but we are some years away from seeing a graduate in every setting. Given the situation, we must be concerned that much of the available provision cannot be of the quality we would wish. In seeking to act as good parents, we should take every opportunity to promote quality.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>I hope that the Minister will welcome the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment. I will write to the Minister on what local authorities might do in terms of these reviews and to ask the sort of questions that I have put in the past&#151;on the parameters governing good quality childcare, such as turnover and level of qualifications of staff, length of exposure to childcare and the age of children. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60426-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   I support the ethos of Amendments Nos. 14 and 30. We will listen to the Minister&#039;s response as regards where we will go from there. I wish to ask a question for the record&#151;I believe that I have informally been given the answer&#151;about children who might be at risk, vulnerable or in need on the various local authority registers. My concern is that, in ensuring that there is sufficient childcare provision for people to remain at work or to take <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

education and training, local authorities&#039; targets and priorities might be changed. It is crucial that the paramount priority should be for children who are at risk to be given childcare. I seek reassurance on the record on that point.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>
<a name="60426-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I thank noble Lords for their contributions to this short but important debate. I hope that I will be able to cover most concerns raised. I will deal with as many individual questions as possible. Amendments Nos. 14 and 30 focus on the issues at the heart of the childcare duty&#151;the meaning of &quot;sufficiency&quot; and &quot;reasonably practicable&quot;. As noble Lords will know, we have published a paper outlining our proposed approach to guidance on childcare duty which covers those issues. A copy has been placed in the Library and, I believe, was circulated to interested Peers. Obviously, if any interested Peers have not seen that paper, please let us know.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>I support the underlying aim of Amendment No. 14: to ensure that childcare provision remains sufficient. As the Committee observed at Second Reading, it is important for children and parents that the childcare they choose is, above all, reliable. The Bill imposes a clear duty on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare provision&#151;I will not go into the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> definition.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>The paper on the childcare duty states that statutory guidance will make clear that what is sufficient will change over time as the childcare market develops. Local authorities must take account of those changes so that sufficient childcare is maintained. As such, the duty to secure sufficient childcare has a continuing effect. While it is in force, the requirement for the local authority to secure a sufficient stock of childcare will apply. In practice, the local authority must consider and plan for future changes that may have an impact on the sufficiency of childcare, including demographic trends and changes in the labour market. Consequently, I believe that the additional reference in the amendment is not required.
<a name="gc_time_0"></a>

</p>

<a name="60426-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>Amendment No. 30 would require statutory guidance to local authorities on the childcare duty to cover two specific factors: the concept of &quot;sufficiency&quot; and &quot;reasonably practicable&quot;. I fully accept that we will need to give local authorities clear guidance on these important issues&#151;and we fully intend to do so&#151;which go to the heart of the duty under Clause 6. I hope that the noble Baronesses will accept our assurance that these will be covered and that she will not press the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>The concepts of &quot;sufficiency&quot; and &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; are central to the childcare duty, as is made clear in the policy paper. Key aspects of guidance on sufficiency are covered in paragraphs 4 to 10 of the paper, and key aspects of the requirements on local authorities, including how they might judge what is reasonably practicable, in paragraphs 17 to 19.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>Although &quot;sufficiency&quot; and &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; are central concepts, they are not the only important issues that will need to be covered in statutory guidance. For example, as our paper shows, we plan to cover important matters such as accessibility. To list in the Bill some, but not all, of the issues we intend to address through guidance could introduce doubt about the extent to which the guidance could cover other areas. It is not appropriate to seek to list in the Bill all the issues that we want to cover in guidance. We want to avoid doubt about the extent of the guidance power so that we can respond appropriately to consultation.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>Amendment No. 41 would require local authorities to assess the quality and sustainability of childcare in their area. It is crucial, as we discussed, to deal with the issue of quality consistently and coherently; that is why responsibility for assessing, monitoring and inspecting quality quite rightly lies with Ofsted.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>The findings from the childcare sufficiency assessment will help local authorities to identify which issues need to be addressed locally under their duty in Clause 13 to support providers through information, advice and training. Again, our regulations and guidance will make clear to authorities that they must support providers not only to meet the requirements of the early years register and the Ofsted childcare register, but also to understand wider issues such as child protection, health and safety, and inclusion. We will also require local authorities to ensure that information and support are available to providers seeking to gain qualifications. These roles, however, are based on local authorities&#039; informal knowledge of their local childcare providers and provision. The gaining of qualifications and the standards professionals must reach to be childcare providers are important issues at the heart of concerns expressed by the Committee. I think particularly of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who raised that on our first Committee day and again today. However, placing a formal requirement on local authorities to assess quality&#151;which is what we are being asked to do&#151;would duplicate and potentially conflict with the role of Ofsted. We believe that Ofsted provides the best possible opportunity for seamless maintenance and sustenance of high standards.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>Amendment No. 41 would also require a local authority&#039;s childcare assessment to include the sustainability of childcare in its area. The childcare duty underpins the change of emphasis initiated by the 10-year childcare strategy: from place creation to place sustainability. We are, as it were, almost beyond the creation of places. In many parts of the country, as noble Lords will know, there is an oversupply. We are now focusing specifically on sustainability of those places&#151;the quantity/quality argument. Indeed, recent data suggest that since March 2005 both closure rates and total closures have fallen in each quarter. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, raised that concern.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>Under the childcare duty, the sufficiency of childcare will have to be sustained over time. Local authorities clearly have to understand the sustainability of childcare in their area. There would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC106"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be little point, for instance, in a local authority supporting a business that did not have the essential capacity to develop successfully to maturity. Clause 8 places restrictions on local authorities providing childcare themselves, if there are other providers willing and able to make appropriate provision. Again, we see this not as a public threat to private, voluntary and independent provision but as a public facility to ensure that there is adequate provision, whoever provides it. Clause 8 places a restriction on local authorities providing the childcare themselves, except in times of last resort.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>Clause 13 gives local authorities duties and powers to provide information, advice and training to childcare businesses to help them to be sustainable. In assessing the sufficiency of childcare provision to meet parents&#039; needs, and in keeping that assessment under review, local authorities will need to have regard to whether provision is and remains reliable and sustainable. The statutory guidance will reinforce those points. It will remind local authorities that it will often be far more cost-effective to sustain existing provision than to launch a new provider; and it will indicate how local authorities might determine the sustainability of provision in their area.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>The duty has been placed on local authorities because they are best placed to understand local unmet need for childcare and to fine-tune support for providers, parents and the market. That is the appropriate way forward because national figures and research suggest that, in many parts of the country, there are already sufficient childcare places. Indeed, local authorities, providers and Ofsted have told us that there is now evidence of overprovision; that is why we have shifted the focus of policy and funding away from setting targets for place creation from the centre, towards supporting local authorities to secure a good match between local supply and demand. Trying to facilitate a new market such as childcare is not an easy task. That is why we believe that local authorities, because it is such a local market, are best placed to do it. We do not, therefore, anticipate the large-scale creation of additional childcare, which I know caused noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, to be concerned about the quality of childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>I have, I hope, a response to the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about market diversity and private and voluntary providers. It has never been the Government&#039;s intention to set up childcare in competition with existing good-quality competition; that is why, under the Bill, local authorities will continue to foster that wealth and diversity of provision. Concern was also raised that the Bill would encourage local authorities to expand maintained provision at the expense of private and voluntary sector providers. The provisions to which I refer will counterbalance any risk that the new duties under the Bill would encourage local authorities to expand maintained provision. Statutory guidance will make clear how local authorities should work with and support providers and set out the criteria that they should consider before they can legitimately provide childcare.

</p>

<a name="60426-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, mentioned workless households. The childcare duty requires local authorities to shape and support the local childcare market to meet the needs of working parents and those making the transition to work. They are a primary target group because this Government are committed to giving people a real choice about work and to helping lift families out of poverty. That is why one of the partners will be Jobcentre Plus, and why the Bill has an economic focus. The overall facilitation and support of the childcare market is likely to benefit all parents, working or not. The duty to secure childcare for working parents is a minimum requirement. There is nothing to stop local authorities securing childcare for other groups of parents for other purposes. Workless households will be covered in guidance, on which we will consult.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_26"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, sought reassurances on the record. The childcare duty and the Children Act 1989 work together: where a child is assessed under the children in need provision as needing childcare, the local authority must provide it under Section 17 of the 1989 Act. That duty is neither changed nor diminished by the Bill. I will write to the noble Baroness if she needs clarification but, if she is satisfied, my assurance is on the record.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, will be aware that one of the ways in which we are focusing on our commitment to raising standards is the additional transformation fund for promoting training. We are not complacent; we realise that there are gaps and a great need to raise standards in certain areas of work with children.
</p>

<a name="60426-32_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>I hope that I have made clear our commitment to high-quality, sustainable childcare, and that noble Lords will not press their amendments.

<a name="60426-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   Perhaps before the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, replies, I might be allowed to put in my five pennies&#039; worth. One might accept much of what the noble Baroness said about the sustainability and sufficiency of childcare. However, the concern of many of us is that, as long as the quality is good enough, the same childcare should be available from one year to the next. It is quite possible to have, in year one, 300 places supplied by settings A, B and C, and, in year two, 300 places provided by settings D, E and F.

</p>

<a name="60426-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>As the Minister rightly said, it is not cost-effective to see a lot of businesses crumble and to open up new ones in their place. A lot of us are concerned about what can be done to ensure that settings that children are used to, as long as they are good quality, are sustainable. Constantly to change the people who care for children is bad for them. Has the Minister considered whether local authorities have enough powers to do that? We may well have a perfectly good setting in street A; and in street B the school&#151;which has the power to do this, and does not have to consult anybody&#151;can set up wrap-around care.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>It is human nature to run after the shiny and new. A number of parents running after the shiny and new offered by the school in street B could well leave the setting in street A with an uneconomic level of occupancy. Desirable though it may be to have extended schools, and for parents to be able to drop off the younger child and the older child on the same campus at the same time, I am concerned that local authorities do not&#151;with the independence that schools have gained and will gain&#151;have sufficient power to sustain good-quality settings that do a good job for parents and children.

<a name="60426-33_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   May I make a point before the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, concludes this debate? I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, for her references to my concerns and for her helpful reply. Reading Lang and Buisson&#039;s reports on the market recently, I noted that salaries for early-years workers increased by 5 per cent last year, while occupancy rates, I think, were at a low, with an average of 75 per cent. There are pressures on these settings, and I welcome the reassurances on how the market will be managed.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>I recognise the importance of consistency and coherence in our approach to quality control. Will the Minister write to me about the frequency with which Ofsted collects information? I am concerned that once every three years would not be sufficient. Also, on how quality might be improved, might it be helpful to have INSET training on one afternoon a month? Perhaps she might think about that and come back to me. A concern regarding quality is that there is not the time for staff, especially those working on shifts in day-care settings, to get together, reflect on practice and improve it. I would welcome a response, perhaps at later, and I thank her again for her response.

<a name="60426-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Before the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, replies, I thank the Minister for her response to the amendment, but there is a real problem here. I have been looking through the guidance, which I received only this morning. One of the problems is that it focuses on putting supply and demand together. That is fair enough. This picks up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, on quantity rather than quality. Paragraph 19 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_3"></a>&quot;We intend that guidance should emphasise that local authorities seek to close gaps with formal childcare as far as is reasonably practicable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>Again, it is all very well issuing guidance, but if it just repeats the words &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; and does not tell you what is supposed to be reasonably practicable, that makes things pretty hard. I know that this is only the preliminary guidance, but local authorities must take decisions on this. It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>&quot;Local authorities should focus primarily on closing the largest and most obvious gaps&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>Paragraph 18 quite rightly lists many types of gaps that can exist, such as geographical, income, specific needs and time. Here it would imply that the largest gaps have priority, whereas there may well be other issues <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC109"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that need to take priority in a particular area. Provision for workless families might be a very high priority in a particular area.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>There is great danger that the guidance issued may be tautological in many senses and repeat the previous wording. I come back to the point made by my noble friend Lady Walmsley: local authorities have to translate this measure into practical actions. They will have to decide whether they are providing sufficient childcare, and they will be examined by Ofsted in that regard. They need better and much more specific guidance than the measure implies.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>I thank the Minister for her very full explanation, which I shall enjoy reading in <i>Hansard</i>. She said that local authorities would have to consider and plan, and that that was a difficult thing to do. Indeed, it will be difficult, not least because the Local Government Association has concerns about the new childcare duties, particularly on improving outcomes and reducing the gap in outcomes between the poorest children and the rest, and the fact that that will put financial pressure on local authorities. The Local Government Association questions whether the dedicated resources will be sufficient to carry out those duties effectively and in the manner the Government envisage. A second question is the sustainability of these resources and the Government&#039;s commitment to building on the gains currently being made. Not only will a lot be asked of local authorities, but they are not sure that they can deliver.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>As I have said many times, I welcome the Bill and its emphasis on providing more childcare for parents who want it. However, one thing I regret is its emphasis on providing childcare only for working parents or those training to work, as touched on by my noble friend Lady Sharp of Guildford. One of the Government&#039;s objectives, of course, is to assist parents back to work to alleviate child poverty, and we all support that. However, we must not ignore children in workless households, who may not need wrap-around care or <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

care for such long periods, but need it all the same. That is what this group of amendments seeks to address.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_40"></a>Workless households may share certain criteria apart from a low household income, such as low educational attainment, stress and poor parental relationships because of that stress and low income. Although the parents may well love their child as much as, or more than, any other parent, they may not have the knowledge and skills to understand what best to do to help the child in its development. A placement in a good-quality childcare setting for part of the week will alleviate or correct those situations as appropriate, and as parents decide they need it.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_41"></a>Good professional staff can assist children in their intellectual and every other kind of development in ways that their parents may not be able to. They can also help parents to do that. They can identify problems that need early intervention. A good centre will work with parents, helping them to understand what the centre is doing with their child and how they can continue with learning through play when they get home. It may be able to lend toys or direct parents to a toy library.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>Having time without the child for a few hours while he or she is being safely cared for and educated elsewhere will help to alleviate stress and contribute to parents&#039; relationship. It would give them time to explore the job market and decide what they want to train for, thereby ensuring the future stability of the child&#039;s family. That is surely the primary thing in the child&#039;s best interests.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_43"></a>Another group of workless households is those where a child has a disability. I have had a briefing from the National Autistic Society, among others, which raised this matter. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will have something to say about it. One of its surveys found that 70 per cent of carers for children with autism could not return to work due to a lack of appropriate care facilities. Securing suitable provision for those families requires workless families to be addressed in a high-priority way. For all those reasons, I have sought to amend the Bill to include non-working families in the local authority&#039;s brief to provide childcare; not just to have regard to it, but make sure that what they want and what they need is provided.
</p>

<a name="60426-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>Of course cost is involved, but such families are likely to qualify for the assistance available through benefits and free places. However, it is important that the places are provided where they are needed just as much for those families as for those who are working. It is also important that the provision is suitable for such children and that staff training is adequate to understand the needs of such children. I shall say no more about that at the moment, as I have a later amendment on that. This group of amendments brings workless families further up the pecking order in the Bill than they are at the moment. There are many good reasons why that should be so. I beg to move.

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="60426-34_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 17 and 23. I have great sympathy with what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said&#151;it would have an effect similar to Amendment No. 17, under which Clause 6 would place a duty on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for all parents. Should we be discriminating against parents who choose as their work, not salaried employment, but rearing their children? Should we be in effect discriminating against the children of such parents, reducing their opportunity for access to the benefit of good-quality childcare?
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>It is crucial that we do nothing that might in any way undermine parents&#039; commitment to their children. It is parents&#039; commitment to their children that grows into a mutually reinforcing attachment&#151;adult to child, and child to adult. That allows parents to make the sacrifices that they do for their children, and children also to sacrifice some of their desires. We are at a time when parents have every reason to lack confidence in their parenting capacity. They may not have grown up with a father, families are increasingly fragmented, and generations grow up with less awareness of other generations. It is no wonder that parents who have been given parenting orders have so often welcomed the imposed support with such alacrity. If the state implies to parents that it can do a better job of rearing their children than they themselves can, some parents will take the hint.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>We must recognise that in many families children experience neglect, but our first approach must be to support those families, not to infantilise the parents by taking on the parental responsibilities ourselves. Neither Denmark nor Sweden, which are exemplars in childcare, discriminates against parents who choose the work of bringing up their children; neither should we. Of course one respects Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s efforts to take children out of poverty, but overzealous pursuit of that aim should not be allowed unwittingly to compromise the commitment of some parents to their children. I may sound too harsh, but the drive to take children out of poverty, which is so worthy, has to some extent eclipsed the need to support parents in their choices about whether they spend much of their time caring for their children or allow somebody else to do that job.

A lack of sensitivity in seeking to do the best for young people&#151;getting them into education or adults into work&#151;may be unwittingly compromising their choice of commitment to their child.

<a name="60426-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>I am speaking too long again; I apologise. Briefly, Amendment No. 23 would prioritise parents who are actively engaged in a pre-school playgroup. My knowledge of these groups is slight and second hand, and I look forward to any comment my noble friend Lady Howe may have on their work. However, I understand that pre-school playgroups normally involve parents in the day-to-day care of the children and the running of the institution. Such day-to-day involvement may allow parents to develop their parenting capacity through formal supervision and education. They are likely further to develop their parenting capacity through informal means such as observing early years workers and parents at play with children. Actively participating parents who are supported in learning about the care of their own and other children may choose to become members of the childcare workforce.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>Furthermore, these parents may benefit by developing a network of contacts in the setting, which may help them to find employment. I hope that the Minister will consider how the work of parents in these settings might be better recognised, perhaps in this clause.

<a name="60426-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 20 and 61, in my name, to support Amendment No. 17, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and to comment on the rest of the group.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 61 would ensure that in both England and Wales a local authority must secure&#151;and I use that phrase again&#151;&quot;so far as is reasonably practicable&quot; childcare provision sufficient to meet the requirements of parents in their area to enable them to take up or remain in unpaid voluntary activity as well as work.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>On 9 March, we debated in the Chamber the importance of the voluntary sector to society. We do not have time to go over everything that was said, but the debate highlighted the many good causes and organisations, big and small, political and non-political, that people help to support, and which more often than not tend to do the job better than statutory organisations. While unpaid, that significant form of work is, none the less, work. We feel that it should be included when a local authority is assessing its area&#039;s childcare provision. Failure to do so could see a decline in services on which many local people depend and rely and effectively be a kick in the teeth to many voluntary activities, not least activities involving children, such as local football teams, after-school clubs or play groups.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>Amendments Nos. 15, 18, 19 and 21 make a few simple changes to emphasise the need to consider the childcare requirements of families as a whole. This covers many of the points we made in earlier debates on our Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 regarding the importance not only of parents and their influence on the well-being of a child but also of the extended family, particularly for the most disadvantaged children and where there is only one parent in the family. As such, I warmly support those amendments.

<a name="60426-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>I have a slight concern that Amendment No. 22, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, as worded and positioned could be read as suggesting that parents in the area may need childcare to improve the well-being of their child, and that they are not capable of ensuring the well-being of their children on their own. Admittedly, some may not, but we cannot suggest that this should be a generalisation.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>Amendment No. 29 raises childcare provision for non-working families, while Amendment No. 23, proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, aims to encourage and support the involvement of parents in pre-school playgroups. He said that he had no knowledge of them. I do. My children went to an excellent playgroup run by Mrs Curly. I agree with him that that would offer the parent a chance to develop skills and a network of contacts which are perhaps likely to ease their path back into work, or they may see that as work they want to undertake themselves. Thus, it covers both parental involvement and non-working families.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>The question of childcare for non-working parents is important&#151;having children of my own, I believe that being a parent is a full-time job in itself, thus it may come down to our definition of &quot;work&quot;. The National Children&#039;s Bureau and the Early Childhood Forum have highlighted that childcare is not a phenomenon needed by working parents alone. All children benefit from interaction with their peers, which helps cognitive and social development. Full-time parents also benefit from a well earned break and a chance to relax.
</p>

<a name="60426-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>Amendment No. 17, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is very important. When we spoke in the Easter Recess, the noble Earl explained his reasoning. I thought that no one could take exception to an amendment whose purpose is to avoid unintentional undermining of parents&#039; commitment to their children. He said that it would be most unhelpful for parents to feel that they were not equally valued for their work in caring for their children. On 15 October 2003, in an interview with the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,<i> </i>Patricia Hewitt said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_6"></a>&quot;If I look back over the last six years I do think that we have given the impression that we think all mothers should be out to work, preferably full time as soon as their children are a few months old . . .

<p><a name="gc_st_17"></a>
<a name="60426-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   I support all these amendments. Clearly, it is important that parents are seen to have the main responsibility for children. Most parents want to have the main responsibility for their children, even those who may not be able to do the job adequately. We should always start from that situation. The points made in a number of amendments about workless households are crucially important. There will be a need in some, but not all, of those households for extra support and help. It is crucial that, from the earliest possible age, professional help should be available and paid for out of the arrangements. However, there are two aspects to this. First, as we know, it is crucial for the parent&#151;mother or father&#151;to have time out. But it is also crucial for the parent to be available for some of the time to learn and to watch the way in which the child gains the benefit of the expert and to get advice. It is very difficult to do that if parents are not there for at least part of the time, absorbing what needs to be learnt. That is very important. I am sure we will hear much more on this for disabled and autistic children. I can remember it being discovered in the period when Geoffrey, my husband&#151;my noble kinsman, I should say&#151;was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Our first party involved an attempt to raise awareness as well as money and support&#151;we had a Father Christmas and so on. We must concentrate on such areas and make certain that there is sufficient supply and that the money to provide it will be there.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>My last point is about learning through voluntary effort. In the early days of the pre-school playgroup, it was magic to watch how mothers who came in&#151;it was almost entirely mothers in those days&#151;gradually gained confidence and awareness. They went off to conferences and learnt from experts what was required. Subsequently some of them became involved in childcare. It would be interesting to do a survey of teachers to see how many of them started out from that background. I support the idea that that is regarded as going out to work within the limited area that we have now, even though we all want childcare to be available to the widest possible range of children.

I also have first-hand experience of playgroups, as I used to run one with a friend when my children were small. In those days, it was a condition that for a child to come to a playgroup, the parent had to commit to attending with the child. I saw many parents who came and developed their skills of talking to children and playing with them. Many parents developed great self-confidence and went on to have careers in childcare or otherwise because of the confidence they gained. However, not all did so. Some parents would come along with their child and be quite content to sit and watch. They did not interact in language development or in developmental play with <br>&nbsp;<br>

other children. Watching is not a sufficient condition for them to gain a qualification to go on to other things, as the amendment suggests. I know that active participation is required, but if we are to have such an amendment, we need to build in pre-school playgroup training and not just attendance at the playgroup.

<a name="60426-35_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  I warmly commend the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for wanting to bring much more informality into our proceedings. I hope she does not restrict the use of first names to her husband and that we could use them more widely in the House. But if I follow that route, I might get into serious trouble, so I shall become formal very quickly. We strongly welcome the contributions of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and hope that they will not in any way be diminished. If taking on more than one can cope with were a disqualification from rising in this Committee, I do not think anybody would be allowed to rise&#151;I would be banned from setting foot in the House.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a> These amendments seek in different ways to add to the Bill groups to which local authorities must have regard when securing sufficient childcare. Before I deal with the specific amendments, which have very different purposes, I shall explain the intentions behind the childcare duty as set out in the clause. Our aim is to give parents real choice about work or training. Without suitable childcare that meets their needs, they may not have that choice. We have focused this duty on the needs of parents either in, or seeking to take up, employment, education or training, because our ultimate aim is to lift all children out of poverty and improve their outcomes.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>Concerns have been expressed that the duty focuses only on the childcare requirements of parents and does not explicitly refer to the needs of children. However, this duty in Clause 6 is only one part of a package of provisions aimed at improving the life chances of children and reducing inequalities, and it is important that we do not view the clause in isolation.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>On the type of childcare to be promoted, because of our particular focus on improving outcomes for groups that currently have difficulty accessing childcare, we have included a specific requirement on local authorities to secure childcare that is eligible for the childcare element of the working tax credit and that is suitable for disabled children. Families on lower incomes and those with disabled children face the most acute difficulties in accessing childcare that meets their needs; that is why it is important to address those difficulties upfront and give them such priority in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_61"></a>Amendments Nos. 15, 18, 19, 21, and 22, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, would alter the focus of the duty so that local authorities, as well as securing childcare to allow parents to take up or remain in employment, education or training, would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC116"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be required to secure sufficient childcare to improve the well-being of young children, regardless of the working status of their parents.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>I have already mentioned the importance of considering the childcare duty alongside other provisions. I shall highlight two. First, there is the duty on local authorities in Clause 1, which already requires them to improve the well-being and to reduce inequalities in the outcomes of all young children in their area. Secondly, there is the existing duty to secure sufficient free nursery provision as a universal entitlement for all three and four year-olds, regardless of the working status of their parents. The current entitlement to 12.5 hours a week for 38 weeks a year will increase to 15 hours by 2010, with a longer-term aspiration of 20 hours a week for 38 weeks each year. We are also developing a pilot programme to provide free early years provision to 12,000 disadvantaged two year-olds, which will have a central focus on inclusion for those who may not otherwise access free entitlement at the age of three.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>These amendments would also replace the requirements of &quot;parents&quot; with the requirements of &quot;families&quot;. We of course agree that childcare must meet the needs of children as well as those of their parents. That is why the assessment duty in Clause 11 is crucial in enabling local authorities to plan and facilitate the childcare market. It is important that, if a child has a particular need, it is taken into account when local authorities work with their partners to secure childcare. Our statutory guidance supporting that duty will help local authorities to identify those needs.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>Let me also stress in this context that, where the Bill refers to &quot;parents&quot;, we are talking about biological parents and anyone with parental responsibility or care of the child as set out in subsection (6). In addition to the child&#039;s father and mother, this can include other family members, such as a grandparent or foster carer. So, whoever is caring for the child will be able to expect the same service from their local authority as a natural parent. There is nothing to be gained&#151;indeed, we think it might be rather confusing&#151;from replacing the &quot;parents&quot; with &quot;families&quot;. The terms &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;parental responsibility&quot; are legally defined and capture anyone who is caring for a child.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>Amendment No. 29 concerns the needs of non-working parents. We have taken specific measures to ensure that the Bill helps all families. We have specifically included a requirement, as part of the childcare duty for local authorities, to secure childcare to enable parents to take up work, not simply to ensure sufficient childcare for those in work. For many workless households, particularly those headed by lone parents, the availability of suitable childcare can make a key difference to the decision whether or not to return to work.

</p>

<a name="60426-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>I have already spoken about the duty in Clause 1 to promote outcomes for all children and to narrow the gap between those with the poorest outcomes and the rest. Regardless of the working status of parents, local authorities will have to work with their partners in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

health field and Jobcentre Plus to ensure that services are joined up and reach out to the most vulnerable and deprived families.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>In addition, the duty in Clause 11 to assess the sufficiency of childcare will require local authorities to look at the complete picture. In order to &quot;mind the gap&quot;, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, put it, in respect of obstacles to employment, authorities will be required to consult parents as part of the assessment. The policy paper that I circulated to the Committee on this issue confirms our intention that statutory guidance will make clear to local authorities the importance of including unemployed parents. Clause 8 provides local authorities with all the powers necessary to support childcare provision in any way necessary to fill any gaps&#151;whether they relate to workless families or others.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the issue of disabled children, who are a priority group in the Bill. But, in addition, existing legislation&#151;Section 17 of the Children Act 1989&#151;places a general duty on local authorities to secure appropriate services for children in need, regardless of the working status of their parents. Under the 1989 Act, local authorities are required to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to their needs. Such services may include childcare, counselling or access to other activities.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>Amendment No. 29 is not necessary, but it is also inappropriate, because including, in effect, all parents within the scope of Clause 6(2) would reduce the special focus that local authorities should have on childcare for parents who are working and training, and those with disabled children.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>For the same reason, we do not support Amendment No. 17, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel,<i> </i>which<i> </i>would require local authorities to secure sufficient childcare to meet the needs of all parents, regardless of whether they are working or training to work. That would have the same impact as the earlier amendments.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 61, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, would amend the childcare duties on English and Welsh local authorities to make it clear that &quot;work&quot; includes unpaid voluntary activities. I share the noble Baroness&#039;s belief in the importance of voluntary activities. The duties to secure sufficient childcare as they currently stand will include the needs of parents for childcare to enable them to undertake many forms of voluntary activity. The Bill uses the term &quot;work&quot;, which will include those engaged in voluntary work. &quot;Work&quot; is not defined in the legislation and therefore takes on its ordinary meaning, therefore it does not specifically have to be paid work.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_72"></a>The term &quot;work&quot; does, however, imply a continuing commitment rather than a one-off activity. Someone who worked voluntarily in the Salvation Army shop two days a week could be said to be working and fall within the duty, whereas someone who occasionally mowed their neighbour&#039;s lawn would not. That is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to say that mowing a neighbour&#039;s lawn is not a thoroughly worthwhile and appropriate activity to engage in, particularly if a parent is at home and looking for another occupation. A person doing one-off activities can, of course, use childcare&#151;no one is disputing the importance of that&#151;but a local authority would not be required to secure that childcare to enable them to do that, which is the point of this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_73"></a>&quot;Work&quot; also suggests something over and above people&#039;s general life commitments or familial duties. Someone looking after their own children and cleaning their own house would be unlikely to be considered as undertaking work in that sense. Again, I refer to the wording of the Bill and am not suggesting that it is not extremely hard work to undertake those activities in their own context. I hope that the noble Baroness considers that a reasonable position.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_74"></a>On the specific points raised by the noble Baroness, the guidance issued to English and Welsh local authorities will indicate how to incorporate into the assessment parents&#039; need for childcare to enable them to undertake unpaid work and voluntary activity. My department will work with the Home Office to ensure the guidance conforms to best practice in volunteering in particular. The guidance will also indicate, however, that when planning interventions to secure sufficiency, the main focus should be on the needs of parents for childcare to enable them to undertake or move into paid work, which will do the most to lift their children out of poverty.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>Amendment No. 23, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and to which other noble Lords spoke, would explicitly include participation in a pre-school playgroup&#151;for example, as manager or carer&#151;under &quot;education or training&quot;, for the purposes of the childcare duty. We are entirely with the noble Earl, my noble friend Lady Massey and the other Members of the Committee who spoke in wanting to encourage the involvement of parents in pre-school playgroups because of the potential benefits for both parents and young children, and in encouraging such playgroups to train and recruit parents into the childcare workforce.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>Playgroups are not defined legally and might include parent and toddler groups, which would not be required to register, or more formal childcare that would. We wholeheartedly agree with encouraging parental participation in these areas, but those concerns are met in the Bill. Any parent formally involved in organising a playgroup or looking after other people&#039;s children, whether paid or unpaid, would already be counted as undertaking work under Clause 6. If they were just looking after their own child, however, this would not count as work in the Bill&#039;s meaning. By the same token, however, parents who are only looking after their own children at a playgroup would not need childcare for those children.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>Under the scope of the outcomes duty, local authorities might consider support for playgroups an effective way of raising outcomes or reducing inequalities, particularly if the playgroup benefits <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC119"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC119</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children from disadvantaged groups. Our children&#039;s centre guidance recognises the value of encouraging parental involvement in activities as a stepping stone to building skills and confidence to prepare for employment, whether through playgroups or other activities, such as leading parents&#039; forums or representing parents&#039; views on governing bodies.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>Local authorities will, of course, be required by the Bill to provide information, advice and training to registered childcare providers, which will include most playgroups. Local authorities can also provide financial or other support for parent and toddler playgroups under their general powers in Section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="60426-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>In summary, I stress that this duty is just one of a wide range of reforms and investments that we are making in early years and childcare. We are confident that, together with the duty to improve outcomes, reform of the regulation and inspection system, the free entitlement to all three and four year-olds, and the information duty, the clause will improve the lives of all families, regardless of their employment status, income, ethnic background and disability.

I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, raised the issue of unpaid voluntary work, and was encouraged to hear confirmation on that from the Minister. I, too, recognise the value of unpaid voluntary work. I know of a village in Cheshire whose elderly people would certainly not manage without a couple there who help them out,. There are examples like that all over the country, are there not?

<a name="60426-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, mentioned my Amendment No. 22. I can tell her that it does not mean what she thought it might mean.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>In response to the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, about the word &quot;care&quot;, I would rather use the phrase &quot;education and care&quot;. I am a little worried that the phrase &quot;nursery education&quot;, which we <br>&nbsp;<br>

used previously, has gradually morphed into &quot;childcare&quot; or even &quot;babysitting&quot;. That is an unfortunate tendency.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>In response to my amendments the Minister talked about the choice of parents to go into work, to go into training and so on. I am sure that most Members of the Committee would agree with me that a very important choice is to stay at home and look after your own child. That choice should have equal status with those other choices. That is why I am so keen to get workless families up the pecking order.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>I welcome the free places for three and four-year olds that the Government have introduced. It is a great step forward for parents and children. But I am focusing on young children, where the equal status of the choice to stay at home is most important, because the best interests of some of those children are served by the mother or father being able to stay at home.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>I have other comments, but I will not extend the debate. I thank the Minister for his response, which gave me some cause for encouragement and comfort. I still worry about the pecking order in the priorities of local authorities. I know that some things always have to have priority. Many speeches have been made in Committee already&#151;and we are only on day 2&#151;about the importance of supporting families who, for one reason or another, cannot or choose not to go to work but who still have an enormous need for good-quality childcare. In the interests of their children, I hope that those needs are not left forgotten at the bottom of the pecking order. By raising the issue of workless families, I hope that we have at least done something about that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para5"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_7"></a>Page 4, line 9, leave out from &quot;area&quot; to end of line 13 and insert &quot;for the provision of childcare which is suitable for disabled children&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_24"></a>The noble Earl said: I had not intended to move this amendment, but following the earlier comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, about concerns from the Local Government Association on whether local authorities have the capacity to deliver what is expected of them by the Bill, I feel it is important to comment. I apologise if I have confused the Committee by returning to the matter.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>Amendment No. 16 is intended to pave the way for the clause-stand-part debate. It would narrow the duty on local authorities to provide sufficiency of childcare simply to parents of children with disabilities. Given the Committee&#039;s particular concern for disabled children and their families, I thought it fit to offer an option, should Clause 6 not stand part of the Bill, which would pose a far lesser threat to the coffers and capacities of local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>The purpose of my tabling the Question on whether Clause 6 should stand part of the Bill is to allow us to consider the wisdom of introducing this duty.

<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Minister for his reassuring comments on the first day of Committee, but I would like to probe him further.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>It is important to consider the history of this country&#039;s care for &quot;looked after&quot; children&#151;in the care of the state. We are very far behind our continental neighbours in the quality of care we provide. Other English-speaking countries, such as the United States of America and Australia, have been as dilatory as us. I am speculating, but there may be something in the nature of dynamic economies and more liberal states such as ours that makes us good at performing economically but less good at providing good-quality childcare or care for the elderly. That may be to do with the level at which decisions are taken, but while we negotiate the level of allowances for foster carers, in Denmark and France foster carers are already well paid for the care they give. They are paid a fee for their work, not just an allowance for costs&#151;although some fosterers in this country are paid fees. Failing to value our foster carers has contributed to the shortfall of more than 8,000 foster carers in England and Wales. Young people have to leave care at age 16 or 17, before they are ready. Too often, I meet young people who have to fight to stay with their foster carers.
</p>

<a name="60426-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>My concern is that by passing down responsibility to local authorities, even in the limited way proposed here, we risk repeating the history I have described. Local authorities have often failed looked-after children because they lacked a strategy&#151;a common and considered approach&#151;and resources. Even with considerable additional resources, local authorities have been finding themselves in deficit because of the cost of caring for their looked-after children. Good-quality childcare is a resource-intensive service. While today we are discussing care for a more prominent group of children, it is still possible to overlook their needs. According to Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s childcare strategy document of 2005, research suggests that parents are poor at judging quality, may undervalue it and may trade it off against price. The purpose of this debate is to ensure that the Minister is mindful of the risks of leaving local authorities holding the baby, as it were. Specifically, I would like to hear his response to the finding by the childcare charity 4Children that Her Majesty&#039;s Government would need to invest twice as much as they have committed if they are to meet their aspirations in this area. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response. I beg to move.

I will comment on disability in the debate on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. I do not know whether noble Lords noticed, but I tried at an earlier stage to move an amendment to deal with looked-after children or children in the care of the state, but I realised that it did not really sit with the Bill. I know that it is a huge concern for some people, and the figures published last week show that the state is not a good parent.

There is a need for a careful elasticity analysis to see what increases in pay would attract the necessary number of people, and to what extent they would simply be attracted away from other services for children. I have a great fear that we are trying to do too many things and that the people will simply not be out there whatever we do to get them out, to get them up and to get them trained to do the job well.

<a name="60426-37_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   Before the Minister responds, I make it absolutely clear that I informed the Minister that I would not move this amendment in this group. I do not wish to leave anyone feeling that they have been put in a difficult situation, and I would certainly welcome a letter as a response to the concerns that I have raised, if that would be more convenient.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_28"></a>
<a name="60426-37_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   I am not sure whether that is shutting me up or whether I have the opportunity to say two brief things. I usually am brief, and I will continue to be so. I, too, do not want to get into the discussion about disability that we will probably have in a moment but this debate gives me the opportunity to say two things.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>First, I declare an interest as an ex-director of social services. Having run most of these services at some point in my life, and knowing the extraordinary difficulties that local authorities face in managing, my view is that few other organisations are as well placed. We always want to replace something that we have with something better; it is like the CAFCASS situation. Let us make work the thing that is going to work, rather than thinking that we can do something better. Local authorities, on the whole, are doing a hugely good job for thousands of children; I would like to put that on record. I have said to the Minister that we really need to value them and the staff who are struggling daily to provide these services and work of quality, and who care about children to the depths of their hearts.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>However, having said that, and although I accept the noble Baroness&#039;s reassurances, we know from research&#151;I do not have it with me but I can get the references quite easily; I think it is Tunstall&#151;that Section 17 is implemented very patchily and that the assessments are made on a different basis. It is a postcode lottery of services, and it links to the local authority&#039;s capacity and that word &quot;sufficiency&quot; again. It is particularly true when you consider disabled children or those with very special needs. I quote the example of a child of extraordinarily destructive behaviour, whose relatives will not look after him for more than two hours at a time, and whose parents cannot get that child provision. You can imagine what that does to the single mother who also has a difficult adolescent child, and you can imagine <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the likely outcomes for that child. It is not that there is &quot;sufficient&quot; provision; again there is the gap&#151;sufficient for what&quot;. Children with specialist disabilities have a particular difficulty with the childcare that they receive.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_29"></a>
<a name="60426-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Earl for giving me an opportunity to talk about funding. I entirely accept everything that he and other Members of the Committee have said about the importance of training and the adequacy of the workforce, without which none of these services would be provided. An important part of the functions of local authorities in developing their local plans is to see that they provide these services in the context of local capacity. Their role in ensuring training and support for the workforce is essential in that context.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>In passing, it is precisely because we recognise that there are pressures on local authorities, and do not want to move further than we believe possible for them to meet those pressures, that we do not favour the imposition on them of yet more unfunded duties in Clause 6. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is always clever to add the words &quot;as resources permit&quot;, or some similar phrase, in her amendments, as the Liberal Democrats so often do, when she proposes a massive extension of responsibilities for local authorities and others. We are at least making an honest attempt to match additional duties with corresponding resources.

<a name="60426-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>I get into trouble when I recite figures, but I do not think anyone would deny that significant additional sums are going into local authorities: nearly &#163;3 billion for 2006-08 in general Sure Start grants, which is an increase of &#163;700 million compared to 2004-06 on a like-for-like basis; the transformation fund of &#163;250 million over and above existing outlays to improve workforce qualifications, also to be available between 2006 and 2008; and the additional funding to enable three and four year-olds to be funded at the same rate regardless of the setting they attend, and to provide the extra weeks in the free entitlement that commenced at the beginning of this month, leading to a significant increase in direct funding to local authorities to meet that cost. I could go on detailing the provision we have made for local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>We have also provided significant additional sums for parents themselves&#151;particularly, but not exclusively, lower-income parents. Child benefit has increased well above the rate of inflation since 1997. We have focused additional resources on parents to enable them to purchase appropriate childcare for their children. The reforms in the tax and benefits systems mean that families with children are on average &#163;1,300 a year better off, and those in the poorest fifth of households are on average &#163;3,000 a year better off. Significant additional resources are available to families to meet the demands of childcare.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, highlighted the issue of foster carers. This is of great concern to us because of the undersupply of suitable foster carers, the principal providers of childcare for an especially vulnerable group of children. We are mindful of the need to take additional steps&#151;including, where appropriate, additional remuneration&#151;to encourage foster carers. We are soon to consult on guidance on&#151;I need to be careful with my wording&#151;standard levels of remuneration; not levels we would impose, but that we would exhibit for local authorities to have regard to. A good deal of work on this is under way. I undertake to write to the noble Earl and other Members of the Committee to set out what we are doing both to give additional support to foster carers and to increase the supply of suitable foster carers.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_30"></a>
<a name="60426-37_spnew3"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I thank the Minister for his helpful response. I look forward to hearing from him on that final point, in particular. I am grateful for recent correspondence from him; it has been extremely helpful. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, for her contribution, and my noble friend Lord Northbourne for what he said on this important matter.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>By referring to what the Government are looking at as regards foster children, the Minister gives me the opportunity to relate what I was recently told by the education officer at the Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa charity, which does an outstanding job in raising the educational attainment of children in residential care. The education officer said how much she valued the &quot;schools within schools&quot; programme, of which the Minister is a strong supporter. It enables young people who might normally be excluded from school to participate, not in the main body of the school but in a unit allied to it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60426-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley </b>   moved Amendment No. 26:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>Page 4, line 16, leave out paragraph (a) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>

<br>
(ii)   who are eligible for the maximum entitlement to the child tax credit;


<br>
(iii)   for the provision of childcare which is suitable for disabled children; and


<br>
(iv)   from black and minority ethnic communities&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_32"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 27. Amendment No. 26 would include a specific mention of low-income families, both working and non-working, and of the needs of disabled children and those from black and ethnic-minority communities. Amendment No. 27 mentions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC125"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the need for diversity in the kind of provision and care appropriate for ethnic-minority families in the duty to provide sufficient childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>There are many different kinds of childcare settings as well as day nurseries. There are playgroups, mother-and-toddler groups and other setups. There are settings that teach according to the Steiner and Montessori principles. It is important that they are all considered and supported by the local authority. Can the Minister assure us that any guidance developed for local authorities will encourage them, in carrying out this new duty, to consider all types of provision?
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>It is also important that everything that local authorities do in relation to this new duty is ethnically monitored, as required by the amended Race Relations Act 1976, to ensure that local children from black and ethnic-minority communities have equality of access and opportunity and are treated equally in relation to childcare. This may mean a certain amount of outreach work beyond what is needed for the indigenous population.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>The Minister in another place agreed on these matters, but said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;We therefore expect local authorities to take into account the need to consider cultural factors when securing child care, and the guidance will give information as well as examples.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee D, 8/12/05; col. 128.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>Although I welcome that statement, we must understand that across the childcare sector the understanding of the implications of the Race Relations Act is limited. Training in anti-discriminatory practice is not easily accessible, due to the limited number of competent trainers working in early years and the budgets available for training. Perhaps the Minister could tell me how Ofsted monitors adherence to the Act and whether the inspectors are sufficiently knowledgeable about these issues to make competent judgments?
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>Paragraph 10 of the notes on the guidance for the new duty mentions socially excluded and minority groups, but there is no mention, for example, of Gypsy and Traveller children, nor any mention of the workforce. It is important in the recruitment, development and training of the workforce that attention is given to encouraging members of all communities to get involved in working with children and to train to improve their qualifications. Children need role models that they recognise. They do not always feel comfortable in a setting where there is no adult who looks like them or speaks their language. I have heard some very moving stories from practitioners about how children suffer when that is not provided, and flourish when it is.
</p>

<a name="60426-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>The promotion of racial equality is also very important for the development of children at this crucial early stage when attitudes are developing. We need to do whatever is necessary to help them develop positive attitudes to differences between people. To a great extent, children do not notice differences between themselves and other children; they get on with playing together, and that is a very good thing. However, we need to address the need for the adults in their lives&#151;those in positions of influence and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

authority&#151;to cover the same racial mix, as far as possible, as the children in the area. Otherwise, the belief will be that only white people are in a position of authority; that is highly undesirable and will not do. A good racial mix among the workforce will also enable an understanding of the cultural differences between children so that they can develop an appreciation of their own and other children&#039;s cultures. A strong foundation in these matters is vital not only to the child&#039;s development but to social cohesion when children grow up. We must not ignore it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_33"></a>
<a name="60426-38_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   If we really are committed to helping the most disadvantaged and vulnerable children in order to pull up the standards of childcare across this nation, it is especially important that we look at minority groups. These were concerns for the Early Childhood Forum, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Children and the National Children&#039;s Bureau. I very much support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on Amendment No. 27.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>I was pleased to see the commitment in the government paper over the Recess that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;local authorities should work with providers to secure childcare that is suitable for and inclusive of: children from minority ethnic groups, including refugees and asylum seekers; and children from disadvantaged and socially excluded groups such as looked after children, families with a teenaged parent, and families with a parent who is homeless, mentally ill, disabled, misusing substances, in prison or experiencing domestic violence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>I thought that was an admirable list. I hope that the Minister can go into more detail and explain how the Government propose to target these groups.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_34"></a>
<a name="60426-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I am in the embarrassing situation of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, having given my reply to the best part of the amendment. She has set out the Government&#039;s view of the importance of local authorities ensuring that there is a sufficiently diverse range of provision in an area to meet those needs. How a local authority goes about it will, of course, very much vary depending on the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>I also stress that, in the wider issue of cultural sensitivity, the needs of black and minority-ethnic children and their parents in under-five settings, the foundation stage explicitly states that no child should be excluded or disadvantaged because of ethnicity, culture, religion, home language, family background, disability or gender. There is therefore a requirement on local authorities to ensure that provision meets those concerns. The curriculum guidance for the foundation stage also gives detailed, practical examples of how the needs of children from diverse backgrounds should be met. The noble Baroness&#039;s amendments would include a specific reference to the needs of black and minority-ethnic families in this part of the Bill. As I have said, the legislative requirements already meet those concerns. We absolutely agree about the importance of these groups.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>In addition, the assessment duty in Clause 11, again, plays an important role in ensuring that local authorities can identify the particular needs of their communities. As well as the duty to assess sufficiency, there are other provisions in this Bill and existing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation promoting the interests of these families. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 already places a duty on local authorities to exercise their functions with a view to promoting equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups. Through our statutory guidance under this Bill, we will give information and examples which highlight practical ways in which local authorities can ensure that childcare provision is inclusive, reflecting the cultural backgrounds and needs of black and minority-ethnic families. Ofsted also takes these issues extremely seriously in its inspections, and I will invite the chief inspector to write to the noble Baroness directly, setting out the particular steps it takes to ensure that its inspections show sufficient cultural sensitivity and actively promote the fulfilment of this duty.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>Evidence suggests that the biggest barriers to access to childcare by black and minority-ethnic families are cost and lack of information. The issue of cost will be addressed through our duty to have regard to lower-income families. The duty in Clause 12 to provide information, advice and assistance will help all families to access suitable childcare that meets their needs. The duty in Clause 13 on local authorities to secure information, advice and training to providers will help them to address the individual needs of all children, including those from black and other minority-ethnic groups. We are confident that, given all these provisions, there is no need to make reference to the specific needs of black and minority-ethnic families in the Bill, and therefore hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied with our response.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response, which has given me considerable comfort.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 34 would place on local authorities in England the duty to secure childcare for disabled children in their area up to the age of 18, where their parents need childcare in order to work. The Bill secures childcare for non-disabled children up to the age of 14, and for disabled children up to the age of 16. I welcome the Government&#039;s determination to support working families who need childcare, and their recognition that the families of disabled children have additional support needs. In particular, I welcome the Minister&#039;s agreement at Second Reading that disabled children may need childcare for longer, to provide parents with the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

additional support they need. I agree with him on that, but I disagree with him that age 16 is an appropriate cut-off point.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>The arguments on this issue have been rehearsed several times&#151;indeed, the Minister was kind enough to meet the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and me to discuss this amendment only last week. I do not propose to take up the Committee&#039;s time by repeating them. Suffice it to say that the amendment would harmonise the provisions for disabled children and their families in the Childcare Bill with other legislation designed to help parents to work, which supports the parents of disabled children up to the age of 18, not 16. It would help a group of families who are currently disproportionately unemployed and poor, and help to close a gap in childcare provision for older disabled children.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>The amendment would help people such as Sophie, who has worked as a school nurse in a south London borough while her three children, one of whom has a learning disability, were growing up. Sophie was able to find adequate childcare for all her children, and to keep on working until her disabled daughter reached the age of 16. After that, no childcare was available. It became impossible to combine working with caring for her daughter. This year, Sophie has been forced to give up a job which was important to her and extremely valuable to her local community.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_115"></a>Recent research bears out Sophie&#039;s experience. A survey carried out by Mencap found that only one in 20 local authority children&#039;s information services was able to identify suitable childcare for a 17 year-old with a learning disability whose mother needed to work full time. There is a chronic lack of provision for this age group.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>I am particularly concerned that, if the Bill sets out in stone that local authorities have to secure childcare provision for disabled children up to the age of 16, it will make it even harder for the families of disabled young people of 17 and 18 years to get the care they need. There is a danger that local authorities will focus on meeting their legal responsibilities only, while neglecting the older age group.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>Setting a cut-off point at age 16 also goes against the Bill&#039;s provisions on information services. In Clause 12, local authorities are given a duty to provide information, advice and assistance about childcare, and other services and facilities, to families of children and young people up to the age of 20. Why give them a duty to provide information about services which simply do not exist? As it stands, the Bill would put children&#039;s information services in a very difficult position&#151;one which could easily be rectified through this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>I know that the Minister shares my intention of ensuring that good childcare is available to the families of all children who need it. For the families of disabled children, these needs continue beyond the age of 16. This Bill provides a perfect opportunity to ensure that they are met. I hope that this opportunity will be taken by the Government in accepting Amendment No. 34, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_37"></a>
<a name="60426-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I am pleased to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, to which my name is added. The noble Lord has spoken with his usual passion, knowledge and conviction on this issue. I thank Mencap and the coalition of disability and children&#039;s organisations for their excellent, if upsetting, briefing on this subject.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>The Government have recognised that mentally and physically disabled children are less independent than non-disabled children and more often than not require formal childcare for longer. If so, I question why this legislation proposes to cover only the category of children up to the age of 16, leaving as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said, this crucial two-year gap, which is covered by previous legislation. The gap will mean that a disabled child is too young to qualify for adult services, and yet is too old for children&#039;s services. More often than not, these children are also in a situation where after-school clubs or leisure provision do not specialise in their needs and are thus inaccessible to them. What assessment did the Government carry out in preparation for this Bill of the provision that parents of disabled children need to allow them to work, volunteer or undertake education or training? There is serious concern that without provision for disabled children up to 18 you are removing parents&#039; choice to work outside school hours, just as we have heard in the tale of Sophie.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>Already, more than half of all families with a disabled child are living in poverty or on the margin of poverty. Childcare for disabled children costs twice as much as that for children who are not disabled, yet 84 per cent of mothers of disabled children are out of work to allow them to care for their child. There is no one else who can help. It is clear that already there is a shortfall in provision for children with disabilities, yet the Government still propose this gap between 16 and 18. Surely the amendment can only have a positive effect on this bleak situation, enabling such parents to work and thus reducing poverty among these most disadvantaged families. Not only that, but it would help to consolidate childcare provision throughout the age range of disabled children.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>I suggest that there is no barrier to local authorities joining forces on issues such as the provision of childcare for the disabled and sharing information about services in neighbouring areas, or even working on cross-border schemes with the private and voluntary sectors. I hope that the Minister will at least commit to seriously considering this proposal between now and Report&#151;unless he will accept the amendment today.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>I finish by quoting the Children&#039;s Commissioner, Al Aynsley-Green:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_12"></a>&quot;Every child deserves the highest quality services. We need to ensure that services adapt to the needs of disabled children rather than the family adapting to services&quot;.</p>

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_38"></a>
<a name="60426-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I was pleased to add my name to this amendment, and I add my thanks to those of the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord, Lord Rix, to the Minister for meeting us last week with his colleague Maria Eagle to discuss this. It was an extremely helpful meeting. The detailed case for amending the Bill to replace age 16 with age 18 for disabled children has been excellently explained already by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, so there is no need for me to go into any great detail.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to know that I feel that the case for change is unanswerable. Once the Government decided to put specific ages into the Bill, it became essential to include age 18 for disabled children. As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said, if age 16 remains in the Bill, it will have the force of law and there will be no incentive for local authorities and others to consider childcare for the parents of disabled 16 to 18 year-olds, with all the pressure that there is on the budgets of local authorities, and so on.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>Also, I am sure that my noble friend will want to ensure that the Bill will harmonise the provisions for disabled children and their families with other legislation designed to help parents to work that supports the parents of disabled children up to the age of 18, not 16. The Employment Relations Act 1999 means that parents of disabled children up to age 18 have the right to parental leave of up to 18 weeks, to be used flexibly throughout the child&#039;s life from birth to 18 years. The Employment Act 2002 gives parents of disabled children up to the age of 18 the right to request flexible working hours to meet their care needs.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>In passing, the usual criticisms from the Government about the drafting of the amendment would certainly not apply in this case, because all that we are doing is to replace the figure of 16 with another figure, 18. So I hope that the Minister has not got that in his brief.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>The other extremely powerful argument against leaving the age at 16, which the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, touched on, is the transition&#151;which is very difficult anyway&#151;from child to adult services at 18. There really would be a very awkward stage between 16 and 18 if the age in the Bill remained 16. If the Bill is not amended as we suggest, I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee an encouraging response.

The arguments have been very cogently made by the first three speakers, so I will not add to them, except to say that the proposed change is very much in line with both the letter and the spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<a name="60426-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>I work in the adult disability field, as well as the child disability field. I am the president of the John Grooms organisation for disabled people, which undertook a review of services for disabled people. This transitional stage between childhood and adulthood&#151;really it is adolescence&#151;is the most dangerous and difficult, not only for young persons themselves but for their carers. This is the stage at which, if there is not enough support at the right time, the young person will be placed in totally inappropriate provision.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>We know already that there are thousands of quite young disabled adults in inappropriate provision, in adult provision or in hospital, when they could live quite adequately in better placements if they were available and if the assessment was made well at the transitional stage. The difficulty is with families who have had provision for care up to the age of 16 and who have struggled to survive&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Rix, have said this on a number of occasions&#151;and look after those whom they love, who often have very severe disabilities. My world is that of physical disability, where sometimes people are quadriplegic, which means real physical care is necessary. Their survival depends on their having some form of daycare available. If that daycare does not continue, those families cannot go on.
</p>

<a name="60426-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>That is the point at which a young person may find themselves placed inappropriately&#151;it is when a young adolescent wants to come out of a house and either go to a college for disabled youngsters or into his or her own provision&#151;because the family has broken down. Often it is not the most economical solution for the nation either, because those sorts of placements are expensive. Therefore, the move to 18 would be beneficial not only for the young people, which is our primary concern, and for their families on whom they depend, but for the nation, in terms of long-term economic value.

I also commend Mencap and join the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, in doing so, on the vital support that they offer families with disabled children. They play a vital role in helping us to formulate our policies and better to understand the lives of disabled children and their families and the challenges that they face.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a>On the specific issue of the amendment, I could recite the provisions in the Bill and why they all move in the direction that we all wish to see, including the higher age limit already in place in respect of disabled children, as against other children. But I take all that as read for the purposes of this debate. My honourable friend Maria Eagle and I, when we met the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and my noble friend Lord Carter last week, extended our wholehearted sympathy to the intentions behind the amendment. I reiterate that today. We shall consider very carefully before Report whether we can make further changes to meet its objective. However, we need to think carefully about what is the most effective way of securing appropriate services for disabled young people over the age of 16. It is in that context that I give a commitment to consider this further.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_43"></a>
<a name="60426-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton </b>   moved Amendment No. 34A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_13"></a>Page 5, line 6, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;( ) Regulations under this section must allow for private, voluntary and independent providers of childcare to provide childcare free of charge for between&#151;

<br>
(a) two and a half or three hours per day at the choosing of that provider, and


<br>
(b) thirty-three or thirty-eight weeks per year at the choosing of that provider.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_44"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 34A would insert a new subsection into Clause 7 to specify that regulations outlining the prescribed description in subsection (1), regarding a local authority&#039;s,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_14"></a>&quot;Duty to secure prescribed early years provision free of charge&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>must allow for a degree of flexibility and choice for the private, voluntary and independent sector with regard to the number of hours and total weeks that they may provide as a minimum free entitlement. Paragraph (a) of the new subsection addresses the number of hours a day to be provided and paragraph (b) addresses the number of weeks to be provided.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>The aim of the amendment is to discuss the interests of real parental choice and the diversity of childcare provision, and to explore the details between free places and subsidised places. We decided to table this amendment because a number of organisations <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contacted us. Currently, some local authorities are giving flexibility and are not enforcing the period of 38 weeks as long as parents are informed that some childcare providers may offer up to 38 weeks and that funding would be pro rata. However, growing pressure is being placed on providers to extend their provision. Clearly, this current flexibility is temporary. PVIs would like the choice of how many weeks of nursery provision they offer above the statutory 33 weeks. They convincingly argue that this will provide for diversity and will not put unnecessary financial stress, as well as personal stress, on the settings at the choosing of that provider.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>I shall take a little time to outline the situation that small PVIs face. Most seasonal nurseries rent shared premises and could not extend their hours or weeks in those shared premises. Suitable accommodation is difficult to find and is often extremely costly. Those that are able to extend the provision have to take into account the cost implication of increased salaries and rent, the cost of lawyers for changing working contracts and extra daily expenses, which all add up, often to a not insignificant sum.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>Montessori has expressed fear that there will be a huge loss of experienced mothers who combine home life with a few hours&#039; work in term time. These women, who choose jobs for a certain number of weeks to have time with their families, do not want or need those changes. They have genuine fears that there will be declining staff morale and a loss of both jobs and business. They believe that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_15"></a>&quot;it is not the child who is being considered but the obsession of getting mothers back to work and not considering that children need to experience some home life and also life within the community with friends&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>That is an issue that we have already discussed.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>As Members of the Committee will know, the free entitlement will be extended to 15 hours per week; namely, it will rise from the current two and a half hours a day to three hours a day. At the moment, many nurseries offer the additional half-hour for a top-up fee that reflects the cost dependent on the area. It is possible for many providers to provide only the two and a half hour daily grant-funded sessions free and maintain a high quality of care because they subsidise those free sessions with the top-up fees received from parents for three-hour sessions.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a> Many providers fear that, once the free entitlement is extended, without the flexibility of choice for PVIs, as indicated in the Sure Start guidance document published in February, they will not be able to subsidise grant-funded sessions. Therefore, many sessional settings will no longer be sustainable and will have to close. The result is that there will not be sufficient high-quality places for three and four year-olds, which is the exact opposite of what the Government claim they are trying to achieve.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_142"></a>Sessional care is the bulk type of care for many nurseries. That is where the heart of nursery schools began, with a few hours every morning. An increasing number now offer longer than three hours, with older <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children possibly staying for lunch on some days, but that is still fewer hours than a full-day nursery, which is classified as running from 8 am to 6 pm.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>The other common alternative is a nursery that offers two separate three-hour sessions in the morning and afternoon. Providers such as these are classed as day care. It is arguably one of the most favourable arrangements for part-time working mothers who may work only two or three times a week. There would be a great loss of such sessional and day-care provision, because it is unsustainable, and a reduction in choice for parents regarding the timing and type of care that they would like for their children.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a> Enabling parents to have real choice by allowing childcare providers the flexibility to continue to subsidise free places will help to support only a diverse range of provider participation in the early years partnership scheme. The fear is that they will not be able to remain in the scheme due to the inability to compete with fully funded places. As I have already said, that can only limit parental choice.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_145"></a>The National Day Nursery Association and Montessori have not been the only organisations to highlight that there is a form of price control emerging from several aspects of this Government&#039;s childcare policy, one of which I mentioned earlier. Such restrictions would be another nail in the coffin of the personalised service that the Prime Minister claims this Government wish to deliver. Removal of choice for parents and the undermining of the PVI sector is just another step towards a radical change in the balance of authority between parents, children and the state, and what analysts, such as Jill Kirby, have called the nationalising of our country&#039;s childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_146"></a>That aside, the long and the short of it is that local authorities will have powers to ensure that all providers do not charge a top-up for places funded by nursery education grant funding. Indeed, it seems that Clauses 99, 100 and 101, added by the Government at Report stage in the Commons, reinforce such an approach&#151;the details of which we will address in later debates.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_147"></a> Within this, there are no guarantees that the level of NEG funding will cover the cost of providing a good-quality early years experience. The fact that parents may choose to pay a top-up, should they be confident that this will provide them with a good quality childcare place, must only enhance the aims of diversity and choice that we wish to promote.
</p>

<a name="60426-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_148"></a>I am fully aware that this may not be the most perfectly drafted amendment. As I readily accepted in yesterday&#039;s Report stage of the Work and Families Bill, I have never pretended to be a parliamentary draftsman. If the Minister cannot accept this amendment today, I ask that he will at least give the commitment to look at this issue between now and Report, and come back with an answer that will help to ensure the continued provision of good-quality, longstanding care, and to address the genuine concern of many providers in the private, voluntary and independent sector. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I thought that the noble Baroness made some perfectly sensible points, which I hoped that I could meet, until we reached the section about the nationalisation of childhood. I should emphasise that nothing could be further from the ambitions of the Government than to nationalise the childhood of every child in the country. I did not catch the name of the noble Baroness&#039;s philosopher who believes that this is the great new plot of the Labour Government.

<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="60426-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I can happily give the noble Baroness a categorical assurance that those concerns will not be realised under this Government. I believe that I can meet the legitimate points that she has raised. Her concern is to see that choice and flexibility for parents are maximised and not constrained, which is our objective too.
</p>

<a name="60426-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_149"></a>I do not know whether the noble Baroness has seen the code of practice published at the start of this month on the provision of free nursery education places for three and four year-olds that we are seeking to expand, but my best response would be to quote from two key passages in it. I hope that when the noble Baroness has had a chance to reflect on it, she will agree that it meets the concerns. Paragraph 5.9 of the code states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_16"></a>&quot;The Department recognises that some providers are not open for 38 weeks and may not be able to offer the full entitlement, particularly in the first year&#151;although they should be encouraged to do so wherever possible. Local authorities must nevertheless secure that there are sufficient 38 week places to meet parental demand. There is nothing to prevent parents from taking up a lesser free entitlement at the provider of their choice and providers should be funded accordingly. However, the local authority and the provider concerned have a responsibility to inform parents about the implications of their decision&#151;in particular, that the local authority may not be able to fund top-up provision at an alternative provider&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_150"></a>In respect of new entitlements, paragraph 9.3 of the code of practice states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_17"></a>&quot;That is not to say that all providers will be required to meet every parental request for flexibility, rather that local authorities will have a responsibility to assess local demand and plan provision accordingly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_151"></a>I hope that I can meet the noble Baroness&#039;s concern. We are dealing with the obligation on the local authority to see that there is adequate provision to meet the new entitlement, but we are not saying&#151;particularly in the early stages where, as she so rightly said, many providers may have difficulty making appropriate adjustments and so on&#151;that they must make those changes otherwise they will not be eligible for funding. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that we are not nationalising childhood and that we do not need to proceed with this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_48"></a>
<a name="60426-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. The people who briefed us are fully aware of the code of practice.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_18"></a>Page 5, line 8, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;( ) The Secretary of State must provide an assessment of the sufficiency of childcare provision by local authorities at an interval no greater than every two years.&quot;

<p><a name="gc_st_50"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 35, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 42. Both amendments are about assessments. Amendment No. 35 implies that the Secretary of State will have been provided with the information by the local authorities. It will make local authorities accountable to the Secretary of State on their adherence to the duty to ensure sufficient provision of childcare and should ensure greater consistency of provision between local authorities. It will give the Secretary of State the information needed to inform future policy and revise guidance or anything else that needs to be changed. There is not a lot more to say about this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60426-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>Amendment No. 42 ensures that the new duty on local authorities to carry out regular childcare assessments consists of an assessment of parents&#039; demand for childcare, both met and unmet demand, as well as the supply of local childcare available. There is an implication that the affordability of childcare is assessed in relation to that demand. Ensuring that local childcare assessments consider both supply and demand is crucial to supporting the local authority to effectively plan and manage the local childcare market and to shape local provision to meet parents&#039; needs. Under Clause 12(5), the local authority will be under a very welcome new duty to reach out proactively to families who do not traditionally use childcare services, but this is about creating demand to meet parents&#039; needs as well as meeting existing demand. It is a crucial aspect of the market-management function that local authorities will increasingly adopt. Therefore, making specific reference to both supply and demand in Clause 11 will assist councils in fulfilling their strategic leadership role.
</p>

<a name="60426-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>The policy note on Clause 11 indicates the Government&#039;s desire for local authorities to control childcare fees in their area. That is in paragraph 12 of the note. Control could occur indirectly. If a local authority deems that local providers are charging fees at a rate that is unaffordable to local parents, they could perceive the famous &quot;gap&quot; in provision, despite the presence of non-maintained providers. The council might then fill that gap with more places in the maintained sector or by directing parents to childcare it considers more affordable. It may not be of such good quality, but it may be affordable. Under those circumstances, it would be extremely helpful to be able to clarify precisely how the assessment process would function.

<a name="60426-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>We have been approached by the National Day Nurseries Association which is particularly interested in having answers to the following questions that relate to how the law would operate. Since it is an important provider in the sector, it is reasonable to ask these questions. First, what will be the criteria by which local authorities and central government will judge affordability? Secondly, while flexibility between regions is important, is there a risk that we could end up with perhaps 150 different interpretations of affordable, one for each local authority in England? Thirdly, are the Government taking steps to co-ordinate a definition of affordability in local authorities across the country&#151;to avoid what I have just suggested&#151;containing bureaucracy for providers and producing clarity for parents? Fourthly, does the Government&#039;s understanding of affordability fully appreciate that good quality childcare providers will need to invest further in training and facilities to maintain and improve their service which will have an effect on the affordability of their places? Finally, will local authorities&#039; understanding of affordable fully reflect the cost to day nurseries of providing childcare in a particular area, for example, land rent, staffing costs and business rates? I am particularly referring to London and the south-east where the costs of providing childcare are notably higher than they are elsewhere in the country. I would be most grateful if, when responding on this group of amendments, the Minister could give me some answers to that group of questions or could at least write to me.
</p>

<a name="60426-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a> Also in this group there are some amendments under the name of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about qualifications and experience, specifying what the regulations must cover with regard to the qualifications. I am very much attracted to those amendments because it is important that we are aspirational in terms of the level of qualification that we specify in childcare settings. So although I am not <i>au fait</i> with whether the actual wording of the amendments would be acceptable to the parliamentary draftsmen, I support the spirit of what the noble Earl is trying to highlight in his amendments. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_51"></a>
<a name="60426-41_spnew3"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   Amendments Nos. 43, 44 and 45 are my amendments in this group. Amendment No. 43 ensures that there is adequate expertise in the local authority to make sound judgments about what is high-quality childcare. There has been much restructuring of local authority services recently, and there is a concern that some of the expertise currently developed in childcare may be lost in that process. As we have seen in the questions about looked-after children and residential childcare, it is very important that those making decisions have an understanding of the true cost of high-quality childcare and that they invest to save and look to the value of good-quality care.
</p>

<a name="60426-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>The other two amendments aim to gather information that would help us to see more clearly where good and not so good-quality childcare is provided. We need to know about variations in staff turnover and different settings and areas; about time set aside for INSET training; about levels of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC138"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

qualification and distribution of qualified workers between different settings and different areas; and about the number of children in early years child care by age and by their length of exposure to child care. We particularly need to monitor the number of infants under the age of 12 months spending long periods in group care. It may be that Ofsted is the best body to do that, but I look forward to the letter from the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, on how frequently Ofsted gathers information. That is the purpose of these amendments. I look forward to the response of the noble Baroness.

<a name="60426-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   The amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, highlight the need for adequate expertise in a local authority area to ensure that its childcare provision is of good quality. They also highlight concerns that recent restructuring may have led to a loss of some expertise at senior levels. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for giving me the chance to ask the Minister some questions. I echo her concerns, as raised by the NDNA. On qualifications, I totally agree and I hope to cover that when we consider the regulations further on in Clause 63&#151;so not to prolong the course of the Grand Committee, I shall make my comments then.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>I take this opportunity to raise a couple of questions based on the information provided in the government document <i>Childcare Bill: Duty to Secure Sufficient Childcare.</i> Can the Minister provide us with further details behind the thinking on the type and amount of provision and the exact age of the children to benefit? Can she indicate, too, the possible timetable of the extension to the commitment to extending free provision to 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year by 2010? What information will the Minister&#039;s department draw on in making those decisions?
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>Subsection (2) states that the duty in the clause will be subject to guidance provided by the Secretary of State. Can the Minister please confirm whether that will be based on the current code of practice and, if so, are any alterations to the code envisaged? For example, what will be the key principles that the Government consider should underpin local delivery of the free entitlement, and what will be the dates for determining eligibility for a free place? I know how the arrangements are made now, in paying the private and voluntary sector, and they are rather cumbersome. Have the Government considered making different arrangements for making payments to private, voluntary and independent providers to deliver free places, and have they had any consultation with the sector on this issue? As I understand it, determining eligibility is done four times a year and a very close account is kept of dates of birthdays&#151;and that information must be in by a certain time. All that is on top of what they should be doing, which is offering childcare.

I am nervous that in so many cases the details of the ideas have not been thought through, or perhaps even investigated at all. We need to dot the &quot;i&quot;s and cross the &quot;t&quot;s before we are satisfied that we are not signing blank cheques or passing unworkable schemes. I hope that the Minister can place on the record in this Committee some more detail to build on the broad statements made in the documents provided to date.

<a name="60426-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   I have one question for the Minister to clarify. The word &quot;childcare&quot; in this context is extremely imprecise; it is like a sort of homogenised cheese. In fact, looking after a three month-old child and looking after a four years and three months-old child are as different as chalk and cheese. Could the noble Baroness show how the costs and the arrangements will relate to the different costs of coping with different ages and different kinds of children?

<p><a name="gc_st_54"></a>
<a name="60426-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I thank noble Lords for their contributions to this small but very interesting debate.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a> Clause 11 replaces and expands the existing legislation under Section 118A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The existing duty already requires local authorities to review the sufficiency of childcare in their area annually, but it does not require them to take any action in light of what they find from that annual review. Clause 11, on the other hand, will require local authorities to undertake an assessment of childcare provision within a year of the commencement date of legislation and then at least every three years after that. That is not to say only every three years, as we have said before, particularly in the light of the views expressed on this by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, but at least every three years. Without such an assessment, the local authority will not know whether there are gaps in provision and will not know what action to take to fill them. It is an integral part of the series of clauses linked to the duty to secure sufficient childcare in Clause 6.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>Standardised and public assessments will provide transparency and comparability within, and between, local authorities for the benefit of parents, the inspectorate and for local authorities themselves. The clause and regulations made under powers contained in it will ensure that parents&#039; views will be heard in the assessment, helping to create a childcare market that is responsive to their needs.

</p>

<a name="60426-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>We have published an updated policy paper outlining our intentions on the childcare sufficiency assessment, which builds on the initial paper that we issued in Committee in another place. Several Members of the Committee have looked at that and copies of both papers are available in the Library.

</p>

<a name="60426-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, Amendment No. 35 would require the Secretary of State to publish an assessment of the sufficiency of childcare provision every two years. There are three reasons why the Government cannot accept the amendment. The first is that Clause 11 already places a duty on local authorities to carry out an assessment of childcare provision. Childcare markets are highly localised, so local authorities are best placed to assess supply and demand and help shape their local markets to meet parents&#039; needs. The Government would not wish to duplicate the important duty contained in Clause 11, as two parallel systems would be inefficient and burdensome.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_167"></a>Secondly, we do not agree that the approach taken by this amendment would be the most effective way of achieving the objective of holding local authorities to account, which we all want to see. It is, of course, vitally important that we have strong systems in place to monitor the performance of local authorities as they progress towards sufficiency, and as such we have worked to build the sufficiency duty into the joint area review process and will feed into their annual performance assessment and comprehensive performance assessment rating. The Secretary of State will have powers to intervene, as he does at present, but will do so on the basis of the joint area review evidence, not through seeking to second-guess in some way the assessment that the authority has undertaken.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>Thirdly, Amendment No. 35 would require the Government to collect data every two years from local authorities. However, Amendment No. 35 does not change Clause 11, which places a duty on local authorities to assess the sufficiency of childcare provision every three years, albeit with regular reviews of that assessment in between. The fact that two out of three assessments will not occur in the same year would not provide a set of comparable results.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_169"></a>Finally, I reassure the Committee that the provisions in Clause 11, and forthcoming supporting regulations and guidance, will cover the need to ensure that there are enough free early education places provided under Clause 7. The Bill brings both early education and childcare together, and disposes of the legal distinction between them. It is therefore essential that assessments of sufficiency cover all types of childcare that children receive. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is right&#151;there is an enormous variety of childcare and we do not want to lump it all together. We want to ensure that that diversity is not only maintained but is expanded. In all walks of life today people want more choice and want their services more customised. We see that not only in education but also in health and right across the spectrum. There would be a public reaction if we tried to, as it were, nationalise the provision.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_170"></a>Amendment No. 42 would put on the face of the Bill some specific items that the local authority&#039;s assessment of the sufficiency of local childcare should include. We will specify what should be covered by these childcare sufficiency assessments in the regulations and guidance made under Clause 11. The childcare sufficiency assessment policy paper describes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC141"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

how local authorities will be required to conduct a comprehensive assessment of both the demand for childcare and the supply of childcare places available for all families and specific target groups. This will be updated regularly and at least every three years. We are currently working with the Local Government Association and a group of local authorities to develop best practice models and toolkits so that the good work already happening can be shared among all local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_171"></a>Regulations will set out that the local authority&#039;s assessment of childcare provision must cover both demand and supply sides of the market locally to highlight any gaps. I hope that meets the noble Baroness&#039;s point. At present many local authorities undertake some sort of assessment of the supply side, but they do not generally assess need and demand. The regulations will set out specific matters to be taken into account in both parts of the assessment&#151;the supply and the demand. In addition, if we list these matters on the face of the Bill as matters which the assessment must include, this may result in unduly restricting the rest of the content of the assessment. It is therefore preferable to use regulations and guidance to provide additional detail.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_172"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked a number of questions. I am in a position now to give her some answers, but, if she will allow me, I shall supplement them in writing. She asked about affordability. We propose to say in guidance that local authorities should assess parental demand at the current market price, what price would be considered affordable by local parents, and what demand would be at that affordable price. Guidance will explain how local authorities determine market price in their area. That will allow local authorities to understand both active demand and the maximum level of demand that they would face if they were able to incentivise providers to bring down prices. As I say, I shall supplement in writing any points which the noble Baroness put to me that that explanation does not cover.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_173"></a>With regard to Amendments Nos. 44 and 45, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has expressed through this amendment sentiments that I think we all agree with&#151;that well qualified staff are vital for the delivery of high quality childcare and early education services leading to improved outcomes for children. That is a central element of our 10-year childcare strategy, where we set out our commitment to a radical reform of the early years and childcare workforce through a new qualifications and career structure. That has been taken forward through the children&#039;s workforce strategy; and, as I mentioned earlier, the transformation fund, totalling &#163;250 million of additional funding over the period 2006-08, has been made available to drive forward graduate-level professional leadership and better qualified staff, particularly in private and voluntary sector early years settings. I shall certainly write to the noble Earl on the other points that he has made today.

<a name="60426-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_174"></a>The Government have already set a target that all children&#039;s centres and full daycare settings will have professional leaders delivering the early years foundation stage in place by 2015. We are using the transformation fund to kick start this work in the private, voluntary and independent full day care settings in 2006-08, supplementing the funding for children&#039;s centres already available through the general Sure Start grant.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>Amendment No. 44 would put on the face of the Bill a requirement for local authorities to include within the assessment of childcare sufficiency details of childcare practitioners within settings who are qualified to national vocational level 6. I think that the noble Lord means graduate level as there are, in fact, no national vocational qualifications at level 6.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>Amendment No. 45 would put on the face of the Bill a similar requirement for local authorities to include within their assessments of childcare sufficiency details of staff within settings who are qualified to level 3. I am assuming that &quot;childcare practitioners&quot; means all staff working directly with children without supervision or supervising other staff working directly with children.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>As Members of the Committee will be aware from the paper that my noble friend made available to them, the assessment will cover supply and demand within local markets so local authorities can identify how best to deal with any gaps in provision. It will not be just an assessment of parents&#039; requirements regarding the quantity of childcare, but also of their requirements for the quality of that childcare. I understand the noble Lord&#039;s concern that childcare is of suitable quality and I share his belief that a suitably qualified workforce is essential, but I do not believe that these amendments are the best way to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>In fact, the minimum qualifications requirements for registration by Ofsted give assurance about standards of workforce quality. These currently state that all supervisors have to be qualified to level 3 and half of all other staff to level 2 in qualifications that are appropriate for the care or development of children. The development of the early years foundation stage will also provide greater impetus to providers to encourage more of their workforce to achieve the level 2 and 3 qualifications appropriate to their roles. This will give assurance that childcare is not only sufficient but of good quality. We are very serious about the achievement of those standards. In addition, quality indicators will be covered in detail in regulations, particularly those setting out registration requirements and the duty to implement the early years foundation stage in Part 3 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>Amendment No. 43 would give the Government the power to specify the qualifications, experience and expertise of the local authority officials who are engaged in the preparation of childcare assessments. While I agree with the noble Lord&#039;s view that those carrying out this type of work for local authorities need to be suitably qualified, I do not think that it is appropriate to seek to put in place arrangements whereby central government would determine for local government matters which are more properly for <br>&nbsp;<br>

the employer&#151;the local authority. Ofsted assesses local authorities&#039; performance on children&#039;s services through annual performance assessments and joint area reviews. These arrangements focus on the results of local authorities&#039; actions in respect of their duties and provide the best basis for ensuring proper performance of functions.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>As we made clear in the policy paper, local authorities will be given guidance on how best to deliver their duties under this clause of the Bill. This will set out clearly what steps a local authority will have to take to assess the nature and extent of the demand for, and the supply of, childcare in their area.
</p>

<a name="60426-42_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a>Finally, we are working closely with the Local Government Association and a group of 12 local authorities to develop these practical tools and materials to support local authorities in the effective delivery of their duties and to share good practice, so we are not leaving local authorities rudderless, as it were. We are looking to ensure that those which are already ensuring best practice will be able to disseminate it. Through efforts such as this, and the extensive funding going to local authorities through the general Sure Start grant, I believe that we are making appropriate support available to ensure that they will be best positioned in terms of the expertise and experience of their staff to carry out their duties.

In the main the rules do not change with the exception of extending the number of hours and weeks. Again, that is a bit of shorthand, so I will write to the noble Baroness. I hope that that gives her something to be going on. On the noble Lord&#039;s question, and I will write to him on the detail, we are very alive to the fact that while we have to for shorthand purposes use a phrase such as &quot;childcare,&quot; there are levels of care and education from birth onwards that we must be open to, and that we have to ensure we are meeting so far as resources, standards of training for providers and facilities are concerned. My noble friend has said in the course of this afternoon and in previous debates on the Bill that we have put, and will continue to put, substantial resources into all levels of education and care so far as this Bill is concerned.

<a name="60426-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   On that point, the reason why I raised different kinds of care that are needed during the period from nought to five was in the context of the cost. The local authority will have to assess different costs for different kinds of childcare. The other point is that the noble Baroness mentioned the separation of childcare along with early years education, early years foundation stage and professional leaders. It has been expressed to me by members of the profession wiser than I in early years that there is a concern that this separation of early education from general education and putting it over into childcare will lead to a gradual <br>&nbsp;<br>

leaching away of teachers in the latter part of childcare. That is a matter for concern. It is an unfair question to ask off the top of my head like that, but if the noble Baroness would care to write to me, I would be very grateful.

<p><a name="gc_st_56"></a>
<a name="60426-43_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   I am not sure whether I am allowed to intervene at this stage; I lose track of the procedures. We had a debate about this at another point. When we are talking about childcare and the general welfare and development of the child&#151;and we will come to this again when we start talking about tort and other vocabulary in the Bill&#151;it is important that we do not see young children simply as being part of the education system. That is the serious danger if we start to talk about education in terms of the early years.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>Education is a crucial part of the whole package. Childcare is understood not only by the profession but by parents as meaning the generality of care of children with development, education and universal &quot;play&quot; included. The hundreds of parents to whom I talk know what they want when they are talking about childcare. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, was not intending that; but as I have struggled with this issue over quite a period I felt that I could not allow it to pass without saying that childcare is so important separated and as part of education.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_57"></a>
<a name="60426-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   The point that I was making was that there are at the moment many teachers dealing with that age group. Once it is cut off, it was suggested to me that there is anxiety that there will be fewer teachers going into that area. I can give the noble Baroness my sources, if she would like. The concern was expressed to me by someone who knows what they are talking about.

It is very much a technical qualification and depends heavily on the quality of the assessor. There may be different opinions on the qualification, but I flag up the concern that we should not rely on it too much. Perhaps we need to go beyond it and rethink what the appropriate qualification is. The noble Baroness mentioned tools. I have written down that that remark was reassuring, but beyond that I cannot read what I have written. I again thank the Minister.

Before I go to the meat of my response, I wish to say something about care and education. I do not mind using the word &quot;education&quot; in relation to very young children, because my understanding of education at that age is that it is about learning. Every single experience that a child has is a learning experience. They know that if they cry, somebody will pick them up. They know that if they pucker up their lips and suck, somebody will stick something in their mouth and usually warm milk will come out. They learn from every single experience. That is my understanding of the word &quot;education&quot; when used in the context of very young children. I believe that that is not an inappropriate understanding.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>I go back to Amendments Nos. 35 and 42. As regards Amendment No. 35, I was a little concerned when I heard the Minister mention standardised assessments. I find it difficult to understand how a standardised assessment will take account of local cost variations. I appreciate the value of establishing a standard to enable one area to be compared with another, but I would not want an area where general overall costs were high to be disadvantaged in any way by having to fill in a standardised assessment. However, I shall leave that point for the moment.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_186"></a>The Minister did not feel drawn to my amendment. I agree that assessments should be done locally, as she said, and that they must be pulled together to inform policy.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>As I understand it, she was saying that the Secretary of State&#039;s decision to intervene would be based on evidence, which it must be, but that the evidence would be on the basis of the joint area review sufficiency test rather than the assessment done locally by the local authority. I am quite satisfied by that, and I thank the Minister for it.

&quot;( ) A local authority must establish a complaints procedure for existing or potential childcare providers who have been disadvantaged by local authorities who choose to provide childcare and related services themselves.&quot;

Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 go to the heart of issues that I raised at Second Reading. Subsection (3)(b) will enable the local authority, in simple terms, to provide childcare, even if childcare is already available, as long as it considers it appropriate. &quot;Appropriate&quot; in this context is open to subjective interpretation. What the local authority may argue is appropriate may be the opposite in the eyes of the voluntary and private providers.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_192"></a>The wording of this subsection flashes like a neon warning sign. Surely, that goes against the assurances that the Government have made about working with the private, voluntary and independent sectors to ensure that no time and resources are wasted on duplication of provision&#151;duplication that could be detrimental to those private and voluntary providers.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_193"></a>The amendment standing in my name does exactly what it says.

It has since fallen to 75 per cent. That worrying trend should not be indirectly encouraged by the drafting of subsection (3)(b). This is an example where one word, if we are not careful, can create a vast loophole which goes against the grain of what the Government have stated is their intention. I hope the Minister can accept either my amendment or that of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, or, if not, say that he will return with one of his own on Report.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_198"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 39. This replaces subsection (4) in Clause 8 with the aim to place a duty on maintained schools to seek relationships with existing private and voluntary independent childcare providers before opening nursery facilities or out-of-hours&#039; care for under-fives.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_199"></a>Various groups, including the NDNA, 4Children, the National Childminding Association and the Local Government Association have raised concerns about the exclusion for maintained schools in the current drafting of subsection (4). They argue that they would like to see schools operate on a level playing field with other PVI providers and fully engage with local authority childcare planning arrangements. The Daycare Trust highlights that. It says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_21"></a>&quot;it is very important that schools play their full and vital part in local childcare planning arrangements&#151;as well as in the wider Every Child Matters process of which childcare is a key part&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_200"></a>The Early Childhood Forum warns us that a failure for schools to account for other provision in their area,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_22"></a>&quot;could adversely affect the viability of private and voluntary sector providers and childminders as well as restricting choice for parents&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>Again, that is the opposite of what the Government hope to achieve in the Bill. My honourable friend in the other place, Nick Gibb, described the Minister&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC148"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reply as weak. I sincerely hope, and I am sure, that the Minister&#039;s answer in this Chamber will be anything but.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>On Report in another place the mood remained one of concern that there remained a strong feeling that the playing field was not level and that we would seek more detail and reassurances. I hope that by replacing subsection (4) with a duty for schools to consult with the PVI sector instead of a straight removal of subsection (4) we will have given the Minister at this end a chance to reconsider the position outlined in another place. This issue clearly sits within the wider debate currently taking place over the relationship between schools and local authorities in the Education White Paper, as well as longer term childcare strategy&#151;I should have said the Education Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 insert two new clauses after Clause 17. Amendment No. 54 will ensure that local authorities act in a fair and transparent way in delivering best-value obligations regarding childcare provision by having due regard to any relevant statutory code of practice that the Secretary of State must provide by the start of next year. Amendment No. 55 underpins Amendment No. 54 by directly placing a duty on local authorities to act in such a fair and transparent manner. The overarching aim of both these amendments is to probe issues of stability and certainty by increasing contestability.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>In its excellent report <i>Children first</i>, published in January, the CBI highlights that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_23"></a>&quot;there are already . . . examples of best practice in children&#039;s services, but this good practice needs to spread. It requires the government to act.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-43_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>It goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_24"></a>&quot;The excuse of complexity is not a reason for delay&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-43_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>The CBI fears that the impetus behind the initiative to establish contestability in the provision of LEA services has slowed. I hope that the Minister can build on the passing comments made in the other place and provide us with the Government&#039;s response to the various CBI recommendations on this issue.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>The concerns over stability and contestability link into the debates we have had regarding sustainability and sufficiency of childcare. Those concerns have only been heightened by the figures which confirm that, roughly, for every five places that are opening three are closing.
</p>

<a name="60426-43_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_208"></a>I have taken time to outline the various interlinking strands of this broad debate. I very much hope that the Minister can take the time the Committee permits to address each section in detail. I beg to move.

<a name="60426-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I would like to speak to Amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 40, which are in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has indicated, there is a good deal of overlap between the amendments in her name and those in mine and that of my noble friend.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC149"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC149</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>First, I will speak to Amendment No. 37 and then pick up Amendments Nos. 38 and 40. On Amendment No. 37, Clause 8(3) makes it very clear that the role of the local authority is essentially that of the commissioner. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_25"></a>&quot;An English local authority may not provide childcare for a particular child or group of children unless the local authority are satisfied&#151;(a) that no other person is willing to provide the childcare . . . or (b) if another person is willing to do so, that in the circumstances it is appropriate for the local authority to provide the childcare&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>The slightly contorted words of paragraph (b) leave the definition of &quot;appropriate&quot; unclear. The purpose of Amendment No. 37 is to clarify further what is meant by &quot;appropriate&quot;. It would insert:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_26"></a>&quot;In subsection 3(b) &#039;appropriate&#039; means that provision of a suitable quality and type of childcare would otherwise not be available&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60426-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, pointed out, we are still left with uncertainty about precisely what &quot;suitable quality&quot; is. There perhaps is not a definitive definition, but the amendment nevertheless tries to clarify the matter a little more than the slightly contorted words of subsection (3)(b) do. Its aim is absolutely clear: if the local authority did not step in and provide suitable quality of provision, that provision would not otherwise be available in the area, and only in those circumstances would a local authority be allowed to step in and be the provider, as distinct from the commissioner of childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>Amendments Nos. 38 and 40 address a different issue. As it stands, schools are exempt from the requirements placed on local authorities to assess what provision is available in the private and voluntary sectors. Local authorities are required to consider what provision is available in schools, but schools do not have a reciprocal responsibility. Therefore, there is a considerable risk that in setting up childcare facilities schools will duplicate existing provision, thereby undermining the sustainability of that provision, often in the voluntary or the private sector. To a degree, therefore, there is a danger that in giving schools the right to set up provision without taking account of what else is available locally, it defeats the whole object of the Bill, which is to provide a diversity of provision and a choice for parents on childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>It is important therefore, in making a judgment about appropriate provision, that local authorities should judge childcare provided by schools in exactly the same way as they would judge those provided by other providers. In addition, it is equally important that schools play a full and vital part in local childcare planning arrangements. The two amendments seek to put schools on the same footing as other providers and not to set them apart.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_69"></a>
<a name="60426-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Northbourne: </b>   I support Amendment No. 39. My mind goes back to the time when schools set up pre-classes for four year-olds and put out of business an enormous number of playgroups and nursery settings. Schools have a reason for having a nursery school as a loss leader: it enables them to get a supply <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC150"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the best children. So schools are in a different business. Amendment No. 39 will probably not do any good, but it is worth giving it a try.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_70"></a>
<a name="60426-44_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I understand that in Oxfordshire there is an obligation on new providers to conduct market research and show that there is a need for their provision before they can open. I wonder whether that model could be more widely used.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_71"></a>
<a name="60426-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   I support the amendment that enables providers to have a right of appeal. I looked through the Bill to see whether, if a provider found itself unable to provide what it wished to and it appeared that it had met all the criteria, it had a right of appeal as a basic human right. I hope the Minister will tell me that it is somewhere in the regulations&#151;he is nodding&#151;because it is crucial that it is there.
</p>

<a name="60426-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>The second issue is maintained schools. When I raised this at Second Reading, the Minister robustly told me that schools were places where these services should be developed and that the concept of <i>Every Child Matters</i> was that school campuses would provide a wide range of facilities so that most parents would want to drop their children off and take their small children to the nursery at the same time. Those are very good arguments, but they contrast starkly with the planning that the Government are trying to put in place to make sure that under-5s provision is not duplicated or lost because other provision moves forward. The Government must be able to find a way between those two things. I have it clearly in my head that the Government are determined that schools should be able to do that. I hope the Minister will listen to our genuine concerns. It is not that we do not want to have nurseries on school campuses&#151;we all think that that is a good idea&#151;but we fear that they will endanger other facilities, which will mean that some parents will lose places because other provision will be forced out of the market. This is not an easy problem. Between now and Report, I hope that the Minister will have a look at how those tensions are balanced to see if there is some way through the dilemma.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_72"></a>
<a name="60426-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Adonis:  </b>  A range of concerns have been raised in this group of amendments and we have had a good and useful debate on the many issues raised. We believe that healthy private, voluntary and independent sectors are vital to maintaining the diverse childcare market that will best meet the needs of parents. We set great store by contestability and we do not wish to undermine or diminish the role that the independent, voluntary and private sectors play in this area. I give that commitment on the part of the Government. It is not a commitment based on words, but is based on existing practice and the changes that we are bringing to bear in this area. In terms of practice, a survey of 459 Sure Start children&#039;s centres showed that 21 per cent were run by private, voluntary and independent sector providers and that those sectors also provided 58 per cent of the childcare in those centres, which are being set up under the Sure Start programme and so are quite apart from the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

existing supply of private, voluntary and independent provision. I hope that that demonstrates to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that collaborative working is already happening successfully and that we are not dealing with conjecture about what will happen, but that we have a good basis on which to believe that the private, voluntary and independent sectors will continue to thrive as local authorities take on the commission roles set out in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60426-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>To commit further to our vision of a diverse market, we are amending the Sure Start grant memorandum so that from this month there will be a requirement for local authorities to consult, and consider using, the private and voluntary sectors as they develop Sure Start children&#039;s centres&#151;as many already do. Clause 3, which is already agreed, requires local authorities to take all reasonable steps to involve the private, voluntary and independent sectors in the planning and delivery of early childhood services, which further underpins the obligations that we are giving them. Our <i>Extended Schools</i> prospectus makes clear that schools will need to work in partnership with other providers to complement and support access to existing services. In a large proportion of cases, schools are making their facilities available, and facilities in primary and secondary schools are being substantially rebuilt through the Building Schools for the Future programme.

</p>

<a name="60426-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>The actual provision will be made by private, voluntary and independent providers, many of whom will find opportunities to make this provision significantly enhanced by these new facilities. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said that they may have difficulties doing so, in the context of private, voluntary and independent providers who currently face constrained facilities in their capacity to deliver childcare on the enhanced basis we are seeking to ensure. The enhanced facilities increasingly available in schools and children&#039;s centres will actually be a great boost to the private, voluntary and independent sectors. They will be able to make use of more appropriate facilities in making provision.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>We are demonstrating our firm commitment to developing and maintaining diverse and high-quality childcare by investing the &#163;250 million&#151;I keep coming back to that, but it is indeed 250 million real pounds&#151;over the next two years, through the transformation fund, to raise qualification levels in the private, voluntary and independent sector workforce. That is another indication of our commitment to see that this sector is properly supported, not merely in its capacity to make provision, but in the training of its workforce so that it has the quality needed, without having to pass those costs on to the parents.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>We are confident that the steps we have taken in the Bill, and will continue to take through guidance, will safeguard the valuable role that the private and voluntary sectors play in maintaining a diverse and responsive childcare market. As I say, the evidence on the ground of what is already happening in the Sure Start children&#039;s centres can give the sectors involved confidence that that will be the case.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>Amendment No. 36, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, would require local authorities to have an appeals procedure in place specifically to handle the concerns of childcare providers. Of course, we are sympathetic to the concerns behind this amendment, because it is essential that local authorities can demonstrate the fairness of the decisions they are taking under this clause, and that they have proper procedures for ensuring that complaints are adequately attended to. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said, and I am glad to say we have provisions for this elsewhere. Local authorities have existing complaints procedures. Good practice guidance already encourages authorities to maintain a transparent and fair process for handling complaints. A new system would not add value to this existing one. In fact, a statutory requirement over and above existing requirements would add confusion to providers and the public, and impose unnecessary burdens on local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>In view of the concerns raised in the Committee this afternoon, however, I feel under a duty to write another letter, I fear, to Members of the Committee setting out the nature of existing complaints procedures, the obligations on local authorities and the means of redress that the providers would have in more detail. I am anxious that Members of the Committee are satisfied that I am not simply producing warm words, but that the current obligations would meet these concerns.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_221"></a>Amendment No. 37, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, seeks to define the criteria that may influence a local authority&#039;s decision about whether it is, in all circumstances, appropriate for the authority to provide childcare. It says that local authorities should take account of the &quot;suitability and type&quot; of childcare in deciding whether it would be appropriate to make provision. These are, of course, perfectly legitimate considerations which the local authority should take account of in making those decisions. However, there are many others which might come into play.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC153"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60426-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>Although the quality or type of childcare might, in some circumstances, be the most important criteria in determining whether particular private, voluntary or independent provision meets parents&#039; needs in one context, the location of childcare might be important in other contexts; that might be a particular factor in rural areas. In other contexts, the cost of the childcare might be a factor, as my noble friend Lady Crawley mentioned earlier. In another context, whether the childcare caters for the needs of particular children might be equally important&#151;taking up the concerns rightly expressed in this Committee about disabled children; and by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about children of black and minority ethnic families.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>For this reason we do not believe that we should define in the Bill what may be appropriate. That must necessarily take account of particular local factors. We should trust local authorities, as elected bodies, to make those decisions, subject to their having adequate complaints procedures and, of courses, subject to their clear duty under the clause to ensure that their interventions are those of a last resort. That is clearly set out when one reads the clause. So, they would have to demonstrate that they were acting reasonably if they were seeking to make additional provision above what the private, voluntary and independent sectors were providing.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>However, we do not want to prevent local authorities from ever making provision simply because a private, voluntary or independent provider operates nearby, for all the reasons that I have just given as to the nature, type, diversity, cost and so on, of provision, which they might need to take account of adequately to meet the needs of their local communities. Guidance will indicate that local authority decisions to provide childcare should be made in an open and transparent manner, allowing private, voluntary or independent providers to challenge them.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40 concern the role of maintained schools as providers of childcare and early years services. In response to concerns raised about consultation, I should stress that other legislation ensures that schools develop their childcare in co-ordination with other local provision, which is the intention behind Amendments Nos. 38 and 39. When exercising their powers under Section 27(1) of the Education Act 2002 to provide community facilities or services for the pupils at the school or their families, the governing body of a maintained school is already required by Section 28(4) to consult the local authority. If the local authority disagrees with a proposal to develop childcare by a school, it can register this during the consultation period. If a school persists in its plans to which the local authority is not in agreement, the local authority could decide not to provide funding to support the development of that childcare. These provisions already impose greater controls on schools when developing childcare than those in place for competing private and voluntary sector providers. Private providers are not subject to any constraints of this nature.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>In addition, Clause 35 of the Education and Inspections Bill, soon to be before the Chamber, will amend Section 21 of the Education Act 2002, so as to introduce a new duty for maintained schools to have regard to the children and young people&#039;s plans of each local authority. That clause will require governing bodies of maintained schools in England and Wales to have regard to the children and young people&#039;s plans when exercising their functions in relation to the conduct of the school and in the provision of extended services, including childcare, for the wider community.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_227"></a>We want to encourage joint working between schools and the private or voluntary sectors to make the best use of school facilities and sites, particularly in view of the fact that these sites are being so significantly enhanced with public funds. It would of course be ridiculous for these sites not to be properly integrated into the provision of childcare since they will in many communities be by far the best equipped and maintained facilities, which, alas, has not always been the case in respect of school sites.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>Many schools already work with private and voluntary sector providers to deliver childcare in this way. We anticipate that many more schools will wish to do so, and to collaborate with local children&#039;s centres, many of which we expect to be located on school sites, and drawing on local private and voluntary sector provision. The private and voluntary sectors have critical experience and skills that both schools and, of course, children&#039;s centres can benefit from when developing childcare.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_229"></a>But we believe that we need to strike the right balance in this area, and that part of that diversity of local provision which we want to see will include provision either made by or enabled by schools and children&#039;s centres. In that respect, we do not agree with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the Bill&#039;s objective of ensuring proper diversity of provision will be undermined by giving schools that right. On the contrary, we see schools as part of a proper diversity of local provision, both in the provision they make themselves and in the provision they enable to be made through their own management of sites and of the schools and children&#039;s centres themselves.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>On Amendment No. 40, Clause 9 is closely based on the existing provision in Section 153 of the Education Act 2002 in relation to nursery education. Clause 8, which is linked to Clause 9, requires local authorities to have regard to guidance made by the Secretary of State when entering into contracts with non-maintained settings to develop childcare provision for children of any age. That guidance will require local authorities to ensure that the contracts provide for the repayment of any financial assistance from those settings where contractual requirements are not met.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_231"></a>The amendment would enable local authorities to extend that requirement to the governing body of a maintained school. It is not our intention to place schools in a more advantaged position than other childcare providers. Maintained providers, including schools, are already subject to detailed requirements <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

both in relation to the quality of the services that they provide and their management of delegated budgets. Local authorities already have in place well-established monitoring and accountability arrangements for budgets in schools and other maintained settings. It follows that any financial assistance for childcare in schools will be monitored in this way through those rigorous procedures that are already in place for monitoring expenditure by schools. Any funding supporting childcare provision will only be released to schools following the consultation process that schools are required to undertake, as I set out earlier. Local authorities will release funding only if they are satisfied that the provision is needed and will not duplicate existing high-quality provision. I hope that meets the concerns raised by the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_232"></a>On Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, I share the confidence expressed by the noble Baroness in best value as a performance management framework for local government. But there is no need for a separate statutory code, because all functions carried out by a local authority, including the provision of childcare, are  automatically covered by best value and by the guidance that has already been produced about the principles and application of best value.
</p>

<a name="60426-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_233"></a>Under Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999, best value authorities have a statutory duty to secure continuous improvement in all their functions, which will include their childcare functions under this duty, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The amendments would result in  different duties of best value operating in respect of childcare provision to those which apply for other local authority functions.  That is unnecessary and is likely to lead to real confusion in respect of both the principles of best value  and their  application.

<a name="60426-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I was just finishing as the bell rang. I assume that the Committee will not wish me to rehearse all the lengthy arguments and points that I was making.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_235"></a>In conclusion, the role of local authorities under the Bill will be to facilitate the childcare market so that it meets parents&#039; needs. They will not be able to fulfil that duty without engaging the private and voluntary sectors in an integral way. The Bill&#039;s provisions seek to strike a balance between giving local authorities the powers and freedoms they need to act in the best interests of their local area while requiring them to support and foster a diverse market that allows maximum choice and flexibility for parents. On that basis, I commend these provisions to the Committee.

<a name="column_GC156"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

far as the amendments to which I spoke are concerned&#151;Amendments Nos. 38 and 40 relating to the position of maintained schools&#151;we are reassured by what he said. It is amazing how quickly one forgets what was in a Bill one worked on, and I have to say that I did not remember the specific parts of the 2002 Bill. It was good to get reassurances from the Minister and, as far as we on these Benches are concerned, we accept his reassurances on the position of maintained schools within the diversity of provision. We support him in relation to building collaboration and partnerships between different parts of the sector. We also support the concept of the extended school.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>I am a little less happy about his answer to Amendment No. 37, partly because it seems to me that the wording of the Bill is extremely awkward and we need a better explanation of what &quot;appropriate&quot; might mean. I understand the point he made about diversity and the different types of provision that one might be looking for. I will read what he had to say very carefully and we may come back to this on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_80"></a>
<a name="60426-46_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   This debate emphasised to me the heavy responsibility we are placing on local authorities to manage these markets. For the sake of critical thinking, I shall say that the presumption that diversity of provider is a good thing is not held by everybody, as the Minister will be aware. Dr Rolfe wrote an article on recruitment and retention in the early years childcare workforce. She expressed concern about the difficulties in retention and the higher turnover in the private sector. One sees that private prisons are good at reforming archaic practices in the Prison Officers&#039; Association, but they tend to have significantly higher turnover rates. This is an issue for children in early years settings where we want stability. I understand that there is some evidence that the maintained sector tends to have higher qualified staff and is more resilient to economic pressures, not being so prone to reduce quality.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_237"></a>Professor Moss of the Institute of Education produced a paper for the Daycare Trust in which he pushed for a state-run childcare system. I know that will horrify many noble Lords, but if the Minister could give me a note on why diversity is so important, it would be helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_81"></a>
<a name="60426-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I will happily do that. I notice that the two professors who have been quoted in this debate take diametrically opposing views, which goes to show that professors never agree.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_82"></a>
<a name="60426-46_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I think I will take the views of my professor any day.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_238"></a>There have been no weak answers from the Minister in this Committee, and he scores 10 out of 10 for a robust and full answer. I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the Minister has answered many of our concerns. I am particularly pleased that he feels that there is an avenue for natural justice if providers feel that they have had a raw deal. But I also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that unless the word &quot;appropriate&quot; is addressed, it will cause <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column GC157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

problems further down the line. Just as there are differences among academics about whether there should be diversity of provision or nationalisation of childcare, there will be differences in what local authorities think is appropriate because of the political complexities of some of them. This has to be nailed down.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_239"></a>I was very pleased to hear that the maintained sector is covered, and cannot go off and do whatever it fancies without the local authority having some idea of how it fits in with other provision, and that there is a duty upon local authorities to seek out private and voluntary organisations. I have one question and I do not expect the Minister to answer it now, unless he can. Would voluntary and private providers run childcare in the way they think it should be provided or would it come under the head and governors of the school?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>
<a name="60426-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   Perhaps I may write to the noble Baroness about the precise arrangements. As I understand it, those responsible for the provision, whether they are the governors of the children&#039;s centre or of the school, would act as the commissioner. They may seek to make direct provision themselves, in which case they would consult on proposals to do so, or they could commission. To that extent, my understanding is that they would set out the terms on which the childcare is provided, which would be the appropriate way forward. They would seek to do so on <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60426-46_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am pleased to be able to announce that a contract has been placed today with Logica CMG for the implementation of the information system component of DMICP. DMICP will for the first time provide a completely automated, integrated health record for all members of the Armed Forces. It will bring better access to patient records and improve the management of patients under treatment, leading to more successful treatment, higher health standards and more personnel fit-for-task. It will also enable the Ministry of Defence to improve its understanding of the health status of the Armed Forces and generate more comprehensive force readiness information. It will enable the Defence Medical Services to meet planned statutory clinical governance standards.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The system will be fully compatible with the NHS Connecting for Health programme and will therefore lead to much better communications between the Defence Medical Services and the NHS, which is the secondary care provider to the Armed Forces in the UK. The system will be introduced progressively between now and 2010; all Armed Forces medical and dental centres in the UK and in our permanent overseas bases should be equipped with the system by early 2008.
</p>

<a name="60426-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>I regard DMICP as the most important single component of the Defence Health Change programme and believe that it will bring a step-change in the effectiveness of the Defence Medical Services. The improved links with the NHS will significantly improve the way in which the two organisations work with each other and bring significant benefits to patients.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>An independent report into the future funding needs   of the BBC has been published today by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

<a name="60426-47_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Child Protection: Information Sharing Index </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60426-47_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley Hughes) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>I am today announcing the Government&#039;s decisions on how the details of practitioners providing sensitive services should be recorded on the information sharing index.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Section 12 of the Children Act 2004 provides for the   establishment of an information sharing index. The Government announced during the passage of the Children Bill that there would be a public consultation on three issues relating to the operation of the index:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>recording practitioner details for potentially sensitive services on the index;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>access by authorised users to practitioner details once recorded; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>recording the fact of a concern on the index.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60426-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The consultation ran from 27 October 2004 to 19   January 2005. There were some strongly expressed concerns in response to the consultation that recording details of sensitive services, such as mental and sexual health and drug abuse, may deter children and young people from accessing those services.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The Government&#039;s response to the consultation was issued in a Written Ministerial Statement on 30 June 2005. In the light of the views expressed, the response set out decisions to implement a differentiated approach to recording details where for a limited number of services, restricted to targeted and specialist health services, consent would be required to record practitioner details on the index. The response committed my department to further work, with the Department of Health, to define those services that would, for the purposes of the information sharing index, be considered sensitive
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The Government have decided that services related to sexual health, mental health and substance abuse should be the broad categories defined as sensitive. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS15"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column WS15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The following specific service areas are those where practitioner details should be included only with consent:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a><i>Sexual Health:</i> information, advice and treatment for pregnancy, abortion, contraception; sexually transmitted infections including services related to HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B or C; rape crisis or sexual violence; sexual abuse and services related to gay/lesbian or transgender issues.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a><i>Mental Health:</i> Child and adolescent mental health services tiers 2, 3 and 4 which includes referrals to, and assessment and treatment by, community-based and inpatient teams dealing with, for example, sexual abuse and eating disorders.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a><i>Substance Abuse:</i> information, advice and treatment for drug, alcohol or volatile substance abuse (glue, aerosols and butane gas).
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60426-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Currently, there are regulations covering disclosure of information about sexually transmitted infections which would not permit practitioners providing services in this area to include their details on the index even with explicit consent. The Department of Health plans to consult on regulatory change well before the index is implemented in 2008, which would then, subject to the will of Parliament, permit, with explicit consent, the inclusion of these details on the index.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The Government&#039;s response to the consultation stated that there would be a facility to override lack of consent to record practitioner details in sensitive services on the index, but to restrict it to carefully specified circumstances, in line with existing law, such as where there are genuine child protection concerns.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>Where consent is given to record practitioner details for the sensitive service on the index, the child&#039;s index record will indicate to other practitioners that an unspecified sensitive service is working with the child. Online access to the sensitive service practitioner&#039;s name and contact details will be restricted to index management teams. A practitioner who wanted to contact the specialist service about the child would make a case to the index management team who would, as appropriate, broker contact with the sensitive services practitioner.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The Government announced on 8 December 2005    that the information sharing index will be implemented across all 150 local authorities in England by the end of 2008. We will seek Parliament&#039;s agreement in autumn 2006 to the main regulations to govern the operation of the index. We will consult publicly on draft regulations in the summer of 2006.

</p>

<a name="60426-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>I attended the informal meeting of the Competitiveness Council on Saturday 22 April, hosted by the Austrian presidency in Graz. My ministerial colleague Lord Sainsbury attended the Council on Friday 21 April.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>At the morning session on 21 April, the Austrian Minister for Education, Science and Culture, Elisabeth Gehrer, chaired a discussion on the breakdown for the EU&#039;s research budget for the seventh framework programme 2007&#150;13 (FP7).
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Commissioner Potocnik presented the principles behind the Commission&#039;s revised breakdown for the budget for 2007&#150;13 following agreement on the overall EU budget. The budget for FP7 would see a 60 per cent increase over current levels to an average of &#8364;7.8 billion per annum as opposed to &#8364;4.8 billion per annum under the sixth framework programme, but this was still a reduction on the Commission&#039;s original proposal in 2005. Ministers were unanimous in stating that the Commission&#039;s revised breakdown represented a good basis for negotiations, but all put forward suggestions for changes.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The presidency hoped that this discussion would allow the Competitiveness Council to agree a general approach on FP7 on 29&#150;30 May 2006. This would provide a basis on which to negotiate with the European Parliament, which expects to complete its first reading of FP7 in June.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The afternoon session on 21 April was on &quot;The   Opportunities of Globalisation&quot;. There were presentations from Vice-President Verheugen on competitiveness through innovation; Commissioner Kroes on less and better state aid for growth and jobs; French Minister Francois Loos on competitiveness clusters; and Helmut List, CEO AVL List, on centres of competence.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>Ministers showed general support for clusters as useful initiatives. Some member states thought EU co-operation on clusters was important, and a number have drawn up a national map of clusters. There was general support for Commissioner Kroes&#039;s plans to introduce some additional flexibility to EU rules on state aid for innovation. Member states were also supportive of improving access to risk capital for SMEs.
</p>

<a name="60426-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>At the morning session on 22 April I participated in a discussion based on the Commission&#039;s revised proposal on the services directive. Austrian Minister for Labour and Economics, Martin Bartenstein, chaired the discussion, inviting Ministers to agree that the revised Commission proposal, based largely on the European Parliament&#039;s first reading text, should be swiftly agreed as an overall package with the aim of reaching political agreement at the Competitiveness Council on 29&#150;30 May. Member states expressed support for moving forward quickly on the basis of the Commission&#039;s revised proposal but noted that important issues remained to be discussed.

<a name="60426-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The informal Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) took place in Vienna on 7 and 8 April 2006. I represented the United Kingdom.

</p>

<a name="60426-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>The informal council discussed globalisation, with the participation of chief executive officers of three international companies. This focused on how to preserve and further strengthen Europe&#039;s attractiveness as a business location and for foreign investment, on completing the single market, and on how to ensure a more equal distribution of benefits among citizens.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The informal council also discussed the working methods of ECOFIN; the present economic situation and prospects for the global economy; the preparation of the spring meetings of the Bretton Woods institutions; and taxation.

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="60426-48_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be held on 27&#150;28 April 2006 in Luxembourg. I shall be attending the meeting with my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith. The Home Secretary, the right honourable Charles Clarke, will also be attending. I thought it would be useful to outline the main issues I expect to be discussed at this council meeting. While I would normally have made this Statement earlier, the presidency tabled a large amount of the Council business for discussion at preparatory meetings this week and I wanted to be able to give the House the most accurate picture possible of what I expect to be discussed.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>In the mixed committee formation prior to the Council itself, there will be a discussion of the French initiative to raise the charges on the processing of Schengen visa applications. The UK does not opt into this measure and so will not participate in this discussion. The presidency will seek views from member states on certain issues concerning the legal base for the second generation Schengen Information System, as well as updating on the state of play.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>There is likely to be a political discussion of the proposal for a Council decision on the improvement of police co-operation, especially at the internal borders. The presidency has put forward two options: first to accept the text as currently drafted; or secondly, for the Council to agree to suspend negotiations on this measure. The Government feel that the outstanding issues could be resolved with more time, but that we would not be able to accept the text as currently drafted without the option of dual criminality applying for cross-border surveillance. We believe that it is reasonable to seek to apply dual criminality in this <br>&nbsp;<br>

area, where not to do so would mean that police officers from one member state could conceivably have greater powers than domestic officers on the territory of another member state.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>There will also be an update on the state of play in discussions on the proposal for a data protection framework decision to regulate the handling of personal data within the fields of police and judicial co-operation. The aim of the proposal is to enhance the sharing of intelligence in the fight against crime and terrorism by providing common standards for the handling of data. The Government fully support the broad objectives of the proposal, but are working to ensure that the ultimate framework is not overly bureaucratic or so onerous that it has the effect of reducing the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies. In particular, we continue to question whether the proposal can or should apply to all domestic processing.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>In the main Council format, there will be presentations and discussions on the issue of human trafficking. This was one of my main priorities for the UK presidency and we made great progress agreeing the action plan. The presidency, the Commission and Europol will give an update on the implementation of the action plan. The Council also intends to adopt Council conclusions on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings on the basis of the EU action plan and including trafficking in connection with major international events, with specific reference to the 2006 football World Cup. There will also be a presentation on the implementation of the EU external relations strategy, which was again agreed under the UK presidency.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>The presidency will be seeking to make progress, following attempts in 2004, on agreement of a list of safe countries of origin with regard to asylum claimants. The UK has already seen the benefits of working closely with countries which are generally safe, as this can act to deter unfounded asylum claims. The Government will support the presidency in its efforts to agree an EU list, but it will of course be important to ensure that the right countries are on the list.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>I understand that the presidency has invited Peter Sutherland, the United Nations Secretary General&#039;s special representative, to make a short presentation to the Council on the UN high level dialogue on international migration and development. I am pleased that there will be this opportunity for discussion as the Government believe that migration can be a positive force for development.

<a name="60426-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Rome II, Law applicable to non-contractual obligations, is on the agenda because it is the aim of the Austrian presidency to reach political agreement on all articles. The UK will support the presidency as we have made real progress in improving this regulation over many months of difficult negotiations. Even so, political agreement in the Council will not be the end of the negotiations. The UK has consistently argued that the scope of Rome II is too broad and not compatible with the instrument&#039;s treaty base under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS19"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column WS19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Article 65 of the EC Treaty. We have not had the support of most member states on this. The effect on the law of defamation is not yet finally resolved. The UK has argued for a solution which would protect the important principle of freedom of expression of the media and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. It was clear from discussion at the JHA Council in February that excluding defamation from the scope of Rome II was the only realistic way of securing political agreement on this issue. We regard this as acceptable and can support it in the Council. It is likely that the UK will reiterate its concerns about scope during the Council. The UK will also continue to urge further improvements on product liability and note the need for consideration on the interaction between Rome II and the Transparency Directive.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>A document concerning questions relating to judicial co-operation in civil matters examined in other Community draft instruments will be presented. The Committee on Civil Law Matters is tasked with ensuring uniformity and coherence in European Community legislation in the area of civil law particularly those covered by Articles 65 and 293 of the EC Treaty. The document lists various instruments which the Committee might be invited to consider in future, and the Council is invited to take note.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>The Council is being invited to open formally the new N-Lex system and to take note of the presentation on the new EUR-Lex system, which will allow European citizens to have direct access to the law of every member state in electronic form and so increase access to justice.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>It is clear from negotiations up to this point that the Framework Decision on Procedural Rights as it is currently drafted will not be agreed by the Council. The presidency has proposed the creation of an ad hoc working party to explore alternative approaches. The UK will support the presidency&#039;s proposal for this working party when it is discussed at the council.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>The presidency will seek to have a discussion on some of the outstanding issues on the European evidence warrant (EEW). The UK is broadly content with the framework decision as it is currently drafted, having made a great deal of progress on it during the UK presidency, and we believe it will be an important part of the mutual recognition agenda. However, concern has been expressed about the clarity of the definitions of those offences to which the principle of dual criminality would not apply. The UK feels that the same principle should apply in this measure as in the European arrest warrant and that a more strict definition of these offences is not necessary. There are also likely to be discussions of whether data retained under the Directive on the Retention of Telecommunications Data should be included in the scope of the EEW. All member states agree that it is too soon to apply mutual recognition principles to this area of judicial co-operation, and are therefore content to leave this to the second stage EEW (which is due in 2007).

</p>

<a name="60426-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>There will also be a discussion of one of the remaining issues on the Framework Decision on the Enforcement of Sentences. The presidency has suggested a compromise that would mean that double criminality would not be required for the majority of cases for the purposes of prisoner transfers, but would allow those member states that wish to continue to apply the principle to do so. The Government believe this provides an effective compromise as a basis for further discussions.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>We expect the Council to reach a general approach on the agreement between the EU and Norway and Iceland on a surrender procedure, subject to final consideration of the form to be used for requesting extradition. The UK supports enhanced extradition arrangements with Norway and Iceland along the lines of the EAW model and therefore supports the presidency&#039;s efforts to bring this negotiation to a close.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>We expect the presidency to seek to reach a general approach on the Council framework decision on the fight against organised crime.
</p>

<a name="60426-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>Finally, there is likely to be a presentation by the presidency regarding a high level political dialogue between the Council, Commission and European Parliament on the fight against terrorism, which was agreed as part of the EU counter-terrorism strategy in December.

<a name="60426-49_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Independent Monitoring Commission</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="60426-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>I have received the 10th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under Articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the commission. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>The commission has provided an assessment of ongoing levels of paramilitary activity and criminality.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>In respect of the Provisional IRA, the report states that &quot;it remains our absolutely clear view that the PIRA leadership has committed itself to following a peaceful path. It is working to bring the whole organisation fully along with it and has expended considerable effort to refocus the movement in support of its objective&quot;. The report also observes that &quot;in the last three months this process has involved the further dismantling of PIRA as a military structure&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>The report notes that progress with regard to other paramilitary groups remains &quot;extremely uneven&quot;. It further notes that &quot;dissident republicans remain determinedly committed to terrorism and deeply engaged in other crime, but they are not always capable of fulfilling their paramilitary ambitions and have recently been foiled by successful police operations. The indications on the loyalist side that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS21"></a>

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column WS21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some would like to wean the paramilitary groups from violence to community and other lawful activities have still to bear significant fruit&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>The report recognises that some organised crime continues, and is an issue for both republican and loyalist paramilitaries. However, it notes, &quot;we have found signs that PIRA continues to seek to stop criminal activity by its members and to prevent them from engaging in it. We believe that some senior PIRA members may be playing a key role in this. This seems to us to be in accordance with the publicly articulated strategy. We believe that volunteers who had previously engaged in illegal fundraising have been told to refrain from doing so&quot;. The report observes that some members of PIRA remain involved in organised crime but categorises them &quot;as distinct from the organisation itself&quot;.

</p>

<a name="60426-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>On the issue of arms, the report states that &quot;we did not say three months ago that the PIRA leadership had in any way given instructions to retain arms. Indeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to us as having been retained would have been withheld under local control despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as      reported by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms &#039;under its control&#039;. The relevant points are that the amount of unsurrendered material was not    significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the PIRA leadership to eschew terrorism and to follow the political path. We will continue to monitor the position&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>On the issue of intelligence gathering, the report notes that &quot;though PIRA has access to people in positions in public and private organisations who could provide them with sensitive information on individuals which might be of use to them, we have no indication that people are currently being tasked to supply such information. While PIRA continues to receive information from members and sympathisers we do not know of information being proactively sought.&quot; The report goes on to state that &quot;we are currently not aware of intelligence-related activity which is outside the aims of the July statement.&quot;
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The Government believe that this report provides further evidence of the direction of movement that PIRA and its leadership are taking in accordance with its commitments on 28 July 2005. The report is positive in that respect and the Government believe that it should make a helpful contribution to the rebuilding of trust and confidence in Northern Ireland which is necessary for a return to full devolution.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>Once again, I am grateful to the Commission for its submission of this report and for its careful analysis.

</p>

<a name="60426-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>On 21 and 25 April, my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr Kim Howells) issued statements welcoming these developments, which are a victory for the democratic aspirations of the people of Nepal. The UK has worked closely with the wider international community over many months in support of these aspirations.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>There is much still to be done to secure a fully functioning democracy and peace in Nepal. In the first instance, we hope that calm will return to the streets of Nepal, and that the security forces will exercise the restraint that has been absent from much of their behaviour of in recent weeks and months. In his statement of 21 April, Dr Howells condemned the loss of life that resulted from the excessive use of force by the security forces.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>We further hope that an early result of the recall of Parliament will be a transfer of the Royal Nepalese Army and security forces to full civilian authority, and that these forces will work under a democratic government as soon as it is formed. We would hope to see a ceasefire by both sides to accompany these changes, as a step towards a peace process.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>In November 2005 the Maoists announced an understanding with the Seven Party Alliance which opened up the possibility of reintegrating the Maoists into a democratic political process. A comprehensive peace process, to underpin the political process, remains a key objective. The Maoists must commit to an end to violence. They must commit to democracy by entering into a peace process with the new government, beginning with a ceasefire.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>The role of the King in a future multi-party democracy is for the people of Nepal to determine. He should understand that there can be no rowing back from the transfer of full executive power to a government representing the will of the people.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>A paramount concern for the UK Government throughout the current crisis has been the safety of British citizens and staff in Nepal. We continue to advise against non-essential travel to Nepal while the situation remains unstable. We will continue to keep this under daily review.
</p>

<a name="60426-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>The UK stands ready, with international partners, to work with the new government and the people of Nepal in this new context. We are looking closely at what practical assistance might be appropriate, in the form of development and other support.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What small-scale sustainable development projects they intend to support in Helmand province, and on what scale, to help reduce poverty and improve security in Afghanistan.  [HL5197]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60426w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  DfID has agreed to allocate up to &#163;20 million per year to support development projects in the Helmand province. We have allocated &#163;1 million annually to a &#163;3 million quick impact fund, which will be managed by the provincial reconstruction team and include money from other parts of the UK Government. It will fund small-scale projects in a number of areas including community development; stabilisation activities implemented by local non-governmental organisations in areas where the Government of Afghanistan cannot work; and support to refurbish drug rehabilitation clinics. This may include irrigation schemes; local access roads; canal cleaning; and skills training for women and war widows. Sustainability will be a criterion for assessing the use of quick impact funding.

<b>26 Apr 2006 : Column WA22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the EU decision on the 8 March to lift the ban on UK beef, it is expected that legislation to allow beef from Northern Ireland to be treated in Europe will be in force by the end of April.

<a name="60426w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Because of the beef export ban, Northern Irish beef has not been promoted in Europe. However, the Government have been proactive in recent months, undertaking a wide range of vital preliminary work in anticipation of the lifting of the ban. It has included commissioning extensive research into export market opportunities and assessing the export potential of Northern Ireland companies; the provision of access to Food From Britain&#039;s world-wide network of international buyer contacts; and funding a three-year, &#163;1.2 million beef market restoration programme, carried out by the Livestock and Meat Commission, a major element of which aims to assist local companies develop successful export businesses in the long term.

There are currently no plans to expand the scope of ISOs or extend them for use with adults. We are keen to increase the uptake of ISOs and are working both with the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) to ensure that local areas are aware of the benefits of this support.

<a name="60426w01_spmin5"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  The Urban Regeneration and Community Development Group within the Department for Social   Development utilises different policies and regeneration tools to tackle disadvantage and deprivation and consequently promote economic regeneration and employment opportunities. The department&#039;s comprehensive development schemes and urban development grants unlock development opportunities by releasing underused or derelict land and buildings to encourage economic and physical regeneration and promote job creation, inward investment and environmental improvement. In addition, the department launched the neighbourhood renewal strategy in 2003, aimed at tackling deprivation in the top 10 per cent. most deprived areas in Northern Ireland. The strategy has four key strands, one of which is economic renewal. The department aims to encourage business development in these areas and to make sure that people from these areas have the skills that they need to participate in the labour market.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>The Department for Employment and Learning will support employers who are expanding their workforce or creating new jobs by providing job-brokering services and suitable training programmes where appropriate. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development delivers the rural development programme 2000&#150;06, which aims to create 1,000 jobs in rural areas in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60426w01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>The Government have introduced a wide range of measures to deliver their long-term goal of improving Northern Ireland&#039;s competitive position, which will ultimately lead to better employment opportunities for      all. Examples include DETI&#039;s accelerating entrepreneurship and regional innovation strategies, DARD&#039;s vision action plan and a number of DSD initiatives designed to regenerate rural and urban areas and promote private sector investment and job creation.
</p>

<a name="60426w01_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>The overall aim of the EU programme is to move Northern Ireland to a state of sustainable prosperity in a competitive modern economy by focusing on the restructuring of its businesses and the key skills development of its people while maintaining a quality environment.

<p><a name="wa_st_14"></a>
<a name="60426w02_spmin5"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) has a range of plans in place to improve access to emergency ambulance services throughout the province that take account of the particular needs of rural areas. They include the introduction of single-manned paramedic vehicles (rapid responders) capable of responding more quickly to an emergency and enable life-preserving treatment to be administered until a conventional ambulance arrives to transport the patient to hospital. The implementation of the advanced medical priority despatch system allows ambulance control to target resources to life-threatening calls and incorporates caller advice whereby callers are given advice on life-saving techniques until an ambulance arrives.
</p>

<a name="60426w02_para1"></a>

Although the report concluded that the most feasible option for an air ambulance service would be in a non-emergency role, providing inter-hospital transfers for patients requiring specialist care, it did not make a recommendation to that effect.

That equates to an average payment of &#163;74,000 per officer. However, savings achieved over the same period as a result of the implementation of the severance scheme equate to &#163;398 million.

<p><a name="wa_qn_28"></a>
<a name="60426w04_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Ouseley </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_31"></a>What measures they have taken to tackle racist attitudes and ethnic segregation following the disturbances in the northern towns in 2001; and whether they have made an assessment of the impact of these measures.  [HL5233]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_29"></a>
<a name="60426w04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The Home Office has had a public service agreement (PSA) since 2002 to bring about measurable improvements in race equality and community cohesion across a range of performance indicators, as part of the Government&#039;s objectives on equality and social inclusion. This PSA target was rolled forward in 2004 to &quot;reduce race inequalities and build community cohesion&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>In 2005, the Government published <i>Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society</i>, the first cross-departmental strategy to increase community cohesion and race equality, which includes a focus on ensuring that racism is unacceptable by improving the way in which the police and other agencies handle reports of racist or religiously motivated incidents; improving the reporting of racially motivated incidents; ensuring vigorous prosecution of racially and religiously aggravated offences; reducing racist reoffending; and providing greater support for victims and witnesses. In addition, for example, we have passed the new Racial and Religious Hatred Act; introduced citizenship education in secondary schools; launched a non-statutory framework for religious education; and established Holocaust memorial day. All of that will help with tackling racist attitudes.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>The Government are also ensuring that community cohesion is mainstreamed into all areas of work. For example, it has been embedded into the comprehensive performance assessment process. The Home Office and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are also working with Government Offices to incorporate community cohesion into the local area agreements. An action guide on community cohesion was revised in 2004 to assist local authorities and their partners. An &#163;18 million Connecting Communities Plus grants programme over three years was launched in October. It will provide funding for race equality and community cohesion projects from 2006&#150;07 to underpin the strategy.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a>Measures have been taken to tackle ethnic segregation, particularly in housing, education and the workplace. In housing, one of the practical measures preventing communities becoming more segregated is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA33"></a>

a choice-based lettings scheme, which crucially has provided people with practical support in moving into areas that they may not traditionally have seen as being for them. In addition, we are looking at a new approach to creating what we call &quot;mixed communities&quot; in areas of disadvantage.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a>We want schools to have well balanced intakes, and we endorse the use of banding in the schools White Paper, as it tends to produce genuinely comprehensive school populations. Building on the good work that already takes place in many areas, the White Paper also sets out our plans to develop further networking and collaboration between schools, such as between schools with very different ethnic populations.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a>The Government&#039;s ethnic minority employment task force is committed to increasing the percentage of people from ethnic minorities and reducing the difference from the overall employment rate. Also, the ethnic minority outreach programme, funded by Jobcentre Plus, involves private and voluntary organisations reaching people who do not normally engage with Jobcentre or other services and helping them to find a job or become more employable. Progress against the current PSA target is published in the annual autumn performance report. We will publish an annual review of progress against the strategy in summer 2006.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_32"></a>How they have tackled the issues of misinformation and lack of effective engagement with all communities through appropriate communications, which were identified as key issues causing racial conflict in the report <i>Community Pride, not Prejudice</i>, which preceded the disturbances in Bradford in 2001.  [HL5234]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_30"></a>
<a name="60426w04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   These issues are important themes in the Government&#039;s work to build community cohesion and empower people to influence decisions. <i>Community Pride, not Prejudice</i> highlighted how perceptions by one group that it is treated less favourably than another can lead to community tension. To help overcome this, the Home Office and the ODPM jointly published, in 2003 and 2004, advice for people responsible for designing area-based initiatives and for local residents and practitioners who deliver such initiatives. The advice emphasises the importance of preparing established residents for change; involving local people in deciding funding priorities; and keeping residents fully informed of the reasoning behind the allocation of funding. The ODPM is encouraging stakeholders to take account of these principles, particularly in the Thames Gateway programme and the mixed communities approach.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a>The Government have supported the publication in 2004 and 2005 of guidance by a number of agencies to help ensure that the media report matters affecting cohesion in a way that avoids inflaming tensions and to help councils work with the media to achieve that. The Government believe that that engagement with all sections of local communities is vital to the successful delivery of public policies and services and contributes <br>&nbsp;<br>

to the building of cohesive communities. <i>Together We Can</i> is a cross-government initiative to empower more people to influence decisions. Practical measures include the establishment of the &quot;civic pioneers&quot; network of local authorities to share good practice on engagement and the &quot;Active Learning for Active Citizens&quot; programme, which provides citizenship education to adults. Youth engagement initiatives include a project with the UK Youth Parliament to explore the use of video to capture community views and to present young people&#039;s views.

However, they fail to acknowledge that, although the current arrangements for post-primary education in Northern Ireland do well for some pupils, they do less well for others.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para6"></a>

<p><a name="wa_st_34"></a>
<a name="60426w04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   In certain circumstances, some member states have more than one rate; for example, some have state aid agreements leading to more than one rate, and others have territories and dependencies that have their own rates.
</p>

<a name="60426w04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a>Our corporation tax regime is a UK-wide system, and introducing different rates in different parts of the UK could distort competition. It would also result in a system that would place a significant administrative burden on businesses and on the Government. Many companies trade in different regions of the UK, and it would not be easy to determine which proportion of their profits was liable at which rate. In addition, such a measure could also create opportunities for some companies to manipulate the rules simply to benefit from a lower rate.
